Panamanian President Ernesto Perez
Balladares met three Taiwan business leaders on Monday at the
presidential office.
</P>
<P>
Balladares talked for more than half an hour with Jeffrey Koo,
chairman of the Chinese National Association of Industry and
Commerce; Kao Chin-ye0n, chairman of the Chinese National Federation
of Industries; and Wang You-theng, chairman of the General Chamber of
Commerce of the Republic of China. The three are members of a trade
delegation that is accompanying President Lee Teng-hui of the
Republic of China on his current Latin American tour.
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, Kao and Wang signed a memorandum of
understanding on cooperation with the Panamanian Federation of
Agriculture, Industry and Commerce to boost bilateral exchanges and
matters of mutual interest.
</P>
<P>
The trade delegation is scheduled to tour the Fort Davis Export
Processing Zone Tuesday to seek trade and investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Wang, also chairman of the Chinese Bank, said his bank is willing
to set up branches in Panama to provide financing services to Taiwan
businessmen here in order to help the government attract more Taiwan
investors to Panama.
</P>
<P>
The International Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) is so far the
only Taiwan-based bank to establish strongholds in Panama. It has one
branch in Panama City and another in the Colon free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
The ICBC is likely to open another branch in Colon City after the
opening of the Taiwan-financed Fort Davis Export Processing Zone,
while another Chinese-run bank based in the United States is also
considering such a move in Colon, an official with the ROC embassy
here revealed.

ROC-PARAGUAYAN TIES REMAIN SOLID: CHANG

Panama  City,  Sept. 8 (CNA)
(By C.P. Huang and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Visiting ROC Vice Premier John Chang
said here on Monday that relations between the Republic of China and
Paraguay have remained firm and solid.
</P>
<P>
Chang was responding to a press inquiry about the current state
of ROC-Paraguayan ties.
</P>
<P>
Chang, who is accompanying ROC President Lee Teng-hui on a state
visit to Panama, said the ROC has consistently maintained close
contacts with Paraguay's ruling and opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
"Our relations have been very cordial," Chang said, adding he
doesn't understand the source of such reports that ROC-Paraguayan
ties may change.
</P>
<P>
Chang declined comment on those reports, but he stressed that
Lee's scheduled visit to Paraguay would not be affected by them.
Paraguay, the ROC's only ally in South America, is the last leg of
Lee's current four-country Latin American tour, which is aimed at
shoring up the region's diplomatic support for the ROC.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said Paraguay may switch its diplomatic allegiance
to Beijing if retired General Lino Oviedo wins Paraguay's 1998
presidential election. Oviedo has been selected the ruling Colorado
Party's presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
A member of President Lee's entourage said communist China has
spared no efforts to squeeze the ROC's international space. "We
should always be on the alert for Beijing's diplomatic offensive
against us. However, we do not need to overreact to various unfounded
speculations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on reports that mainland China may set up a commercial
office in Paraguay, Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang said the ROC
will not intervene in mainland China's commercial activities. Beijing
already has a commercial office in Panama.

</P>
<P>
In the communique, the two heads of state pledged to strengthen
bilateral political, economic and trade cooperation, while expressing
satisfaction over Taiwanese investment in Panamanian harbors, air
shipment and the Fort Davis Export Processing Zone.
</P>

President Lee expressed gratitude for being given the privilege
to attend the World Congress on the Panama Canal. He said that the

Panamanian control. Panama will take over the administration of the
canal at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
The ROC is willing to help ensure successful operation of the
canal in the future and to provide assistance in its future
development, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
President Balladares lauded the ROC's significant contributions
to the international community and reaffirmed Panamanian support for
the ROC's participation in world affairs.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents recognized both countries' significant
achievements in democratization, and applauded the stable political
transformations the ROC and Panama have undergone and the freedoms
and rights their citizens are guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
The two national leaders exchanged their views on issues of
mutual concern in a friendly atmosphere, reaffirming their commitment
to such international principles as respecting national sovereignty,
non-interference in other nations' internal affairs and not resorting
to military force to resolve disputes.
</P>

business representatives and 197 reporters, arrived in Panama on

The southern Taiwan port city of
Kaohsiung is to sign a sisterhood agreement with Brisbane on Tuesday,
Kaohsiung Mayor Wu Tun-yi said in the Australian coastal city.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with CNA, Wu said the agreement is significant
because it means Kaohsiung and Brisbane will forge closer cultural,
educational and trade ties.
</P>
<P>
"Brisbane is the 21st sister city of Kaohsiung and the agreement
will not only bring the two cities closer but also deepen friendship
among people of the two cities. I believe we will have stronger
cooperation between Kaohsiung and Brisbane in the years ahead," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Brisbane is the first Australian city to twin itself with
Taiwan's second largest city.

<P>
Wu, who arrived in Brisbane on Monday, was feted by Brisbane
Mayor Jim Soorley that night. More than 200 guests, including
government officials and Taiwanese immigrants, attended the party.
</P>
<P>
Wu first visited Brisbane last year to attend the International

<P>
Recent appreciation of the yen against
the US dollar has prompted transpacific shipping lines to increase
their currency surcharge on cargo moving from the United States to
Japan.
</P>
<P>
The Transpacific Westbound Rate Agreement (TWRA) said it will
raise its Japan currency adjustment factor (CAF) surcharge on
Japan-bound cargo from 38 to 43 percent, effective the calendar
quarter beginning October 1. TWRA's CAF on cargo to Taiwan will
remain at 9 percent, and the CAF to Singapore will remain 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
The agreement adjusts its currency surcharges on a quarterly
basis in accordance with an established formula that tracks exchange
rates against average member line local currency costs incurred in
certain destination markets.
</P>
<P>
TWRA also said that its fuel adjustment factor surcharge --
intended to help offset the cost impacts of rising marine fuel prices
-- will remain in effect for all destinations at its current level.

TWRA is a rate-making group of 11 ocean and intermodal
transportation companies serving the trade lane from ports and inland

A diplomatic rift is looming between
Australia and India because of a bid by Pakistan to buy
Australian-made frigates and other defense equipment, defense sources
said.
</P>
<P>
They said the head of Pakistan's Air Force, Air Marshal Abbasa
Khattak, will visit Australia next week and will raise the issue of
purchasing of Australian frigates and other defense equipment.
</P>
<P>
Australia has indicated a willingness to approve increased
military sales even though there was a row between Canberra and New
Delhi in 1990 over the supply of surplus Mirage aircraft of the Royal
Australian Air Force to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani diplomats told reporters that Khattak would look for
Australian government soft loans or other assistance for the military
purchases, which are expected to include patrol boats, armored
personnel carriers and aircraft.
</P>
<P>
India believes Pakistan's naval expansion is for offensive
purposes, such as blockading ports on India's west coast. But
Pakistan says the buildup is aimed at protecting the country's vital
maritime routes, particularly to the Persian Gulf.

NEW TARGET IN GLOBAL CAMPAIGN TO PROTECT OZONE LAYER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Ottawa,  Sept.  8 (CNA)
(By S.C. CHANG)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Experts reported "tremendous progress" in
the worldwide fight against the depletion of the ozone layer Monday,
but they also reiterated that the Earth's protective shield continues
to waste away and that its full recovery won't take place for another
50 to 100 years.
</P>
<P>
The good news-bad news scenario was driven home on the eve of the
10th anniversary of the Montreal Protocol, an international agreement
to reduce substances that attack the ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
The deal is to be updated and revised at a week-long meeting of
environmental officials from more than 100 countries to begin in
Montreal on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Christine Stewart, Canada's environment minister, said the
benefits of the protocol are already clear. "Over the next 50 years,
we will prevent millions of cases of skin cancer and eye cataracts,"
she told a luncheon meeting organized by the environmental group,
Friends of the Earth.
</P>
<P>
"Much work has been done but much work remains to be done," she
added.
</P>
<P>
An Environment Canada report released Monday confirms that even
with full implementation of the Montreal phase-out controls, it will
take over 50 years for the ozone layer to recover.
</P>
<P>
When scientists first raised the alarm about chemicals that were
eating away at the ozone layer, the most notorious substances were
the CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) used in air conditioners and
refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
Although a black market in CFCs has developed, their elimination
as set out in the protocol has largely been on target.
</P>
<P>
Attention is now focused on another villain: methyl bromide, a
colorless and odorless gas used in agrifood industries to control
insects, pests, diseases, weeds and rodents. It is also used to
fumigate grain storage facilities, flour mills, and ships and trains
carrying agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
Scientists estimate that methyl bromide is at least 50 times more
damaging to the ozone layer than CFCs on a per molecule basis.
Emissions of methyl bromide from human activities are said to account
for some 10 percent of global ozone losses.
</P>
<P>
Canada wants tougher phase-out controls on the chemical. "We want
to see the timetable compressed, with developed countries committing
to a phaseout by the year 2001, and developing nations no later than
2011, except for quarantine and pre-shipment uses," Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
Rob Kerr, a researcher for Friends of the Earth, said the group
wants the chemical phased out earlier in developing countries, by
2006. "Elimination of methyl bromide would be the single largest step
in the recovery of the ozone layer," he said.

SEVERAL ASIAN ECONOMIES IN TROUBLE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Los  Angeles,  Sept.  8  (CNA)
(By Philip Liu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Times said in an
editorial Monday that Southeast Asian Stock markets and currencies
are in deep trouble, rocking the economies of Thailand, Malaysia,
Indonesia and the Philippines, once dubbed the tigers of
international trade.
</P>
<P>
"Confidence is deteriorating in the ability of the four
governments to manage the situation. This is a timely alert for the
region. A decade of export-driven prosperity has masked domestic
problems, overheated economies and eroded financial discipline. A new
game plan is needed," the daily opined.
</P>
<P>
"Plentiful and cheap labor fueled the economic boom, and the
business sector borrowed overseas -- where interest rates were lower
-- to finance their operations and investments at home. Credit was
easy, and borrowed money was plowed into real estate and construction
projects," it reported.
</P>
<P>
But once mainland China offered its own cheap and plentiful labor
to attract foreign manufacturers, "the tigers found their exports
slowed by stiff competition," it noted.
</P>
<P>
"In these troubled times came the July 2 devaluation of the Thai
currency and the steep sell-off on the Bangkok currency exchange. The
other Southeast Asian countries let their own currencies follow the
Thai baht down in relation to the US dollar," it said.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that borrowers holding dollar-denominated loans
suddenly found repayment schedules decidedly more expensive. Interest
rates soared and the stock markets tumbled, aggravating the
underlying weakness in the economies.

Premier Vincent Siew's administrative
report to the Legislative Yuan received mixed reactions Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Hung-ki, secretary general of ruling Kuomintang's
Legislative Yuan caucus, said that the six major tasks Siew outlined
are in the right direction and will be able to meet society's needs.
</P>

Siew said in the report Tuesday that the new Cabinet's six policy
priorities are improving social order, promoting economic
development, upgrading the quality of life, strengthening cultural

solidifying national security.
</P>
<P>
Pledging that the Siew Cabinet would enjoy the full support of

by deeds and said his caucus would review the Cabinet's progress in
six months.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh Tsung-ming, convenor of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) caucus, faulted Siew for not mentioning his
agricultural policy, saying that agriculture is the basis of national
development.

<P>
Chu Huei-liang of the New Party said that the Siew Cabinet is
basically toeing the line of its predecessor, the Lien Cabinet, and

NON-STATE-RUN ECONOMY TO BOOM AFTER CCP CONGRESS: BEIJING SCHOLAR

The renovation of mainland China's

</P>

to 40 percent of the old system still existent, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Chang was quoted as saying that reforming the "remaining hard
bones" is key to the success of renovating national enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Mainland China being able to erect the infrastructure of a
market-oriented economy with socialist characteristics at the end of
this century will depend on whether substantial progress can be made
on the reform of state enterprises, he said, adding that the present
is a crucial period for these reforms.
</P>
<P>
The present offers excellent opportunities for reform, Chang
said, noting the economy is in its best shape in recent years and
inflation is under control. Most of all, he said, since 50 to 60
percent of small-scale national enterprises have been set free of
state control, the government can concentrate even more on handling
the reform of the remaining state-run business.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Economics Institute observed that with the
expected breakthrough in the state-run system after the CCP congress,
national business renovation will get some needed new blood.

PIG POPULATION SHOULD BE FURTHER CUT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  9 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The pig population in Taiwan has declined
by one-third since the foot-and-mouth disease epidemic struck the
island in March, but the Agriculture Commission said on Tuesday that
the pig-raising industry should decrease the number of pigs by a
further 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The commission said that as the supply of pork is outpacing local
demand, pig farmers should further reduce stock levels to prevent the
price of pork from dropping further.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that as of the end of July, there are currently
around 8.53 million pigs in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Following the epidemic, pork exports to Japan have been
suspended, the commission said, adding that local demand has also
fallen.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Taiwan exported US$1.54 billion-worth of pork to
Japan, accounting for 99.4 percent of Taiwan's total pork exports or
nearly 50 percent of Japan's total pork imports. The export market
formerly accounted for some 45 percent of total pork production in
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The wholesale price of pork has dropped to NT$30 per kilo,
compared with around NT$45 per kilo before the epidemic.

RELIANCE OF TAIWAN VESSELS ON PANAMA CANAL DECREASING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  9 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The reliance of Taiwan-registered vessels
on the Panama Canal is decreasing, as the rate of Taiwan ships
passing through the waterway dropped from 8 percent of the total in
1991 to 4.2 percent of the total in 1996, a government study shows.
</P>
<P>
The study made by the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications shows that Taiwan-registered ships used the Panama
Canal 137 times in 1995, paying some US$10 million in passage fees to
the canal authorities, or about 2 percent of the canal's overall
annual income.
</P>
<P>
Currently, around 40 ships use the canal each day, about half of
which sail between the east coast of the United States and the Far
East, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Evergreen Marine Corp. and Yangming Marine Transport Corp. are
the only Taiwan-based shipping companies plying these routes, making
Taiwan the 12th- or 13th-largest user of the Panama Canal. The US,
Japan and mainland China are the top three users of the waterway.
</P>
<P>
Grain shipments made up about 35 percent of the overall goods
transported between Taiwan and the US, while coal and chemical
materials accounted for about 18 percent and container cargo for 14
percent.

2 PERCENTAGE POINT DROP IN ASEAN GROWTH SEEN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Singapore,  Sept.  9  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recent turmoil in the regional
currency and stock markets could shave up to two percentage points
off ASEAN's economic growth this year, economists and analysts in
Singapore predicted.
</P>
<P>
However, while the impact on the key ASEAN countries -- Thailand,
Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines -- would be
uneven, the slowdown in Southeast Asia could extend up to 12 months,
they said. ASEAN's other members are Brunei, Myanmar, Laos and
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Bruce Gale, analyst at the Singapore office of the Political
and Economic Risk Consultancy, said he expects a two percentage point
drop in growth across the whole region this year, The Straits Times
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
While last week was probably the most volatile, there would be
more turbulence ahead, he said.
</P>
<P>
The real effect of the events of the past few weeks will be felt
next year as economies slow down, Gale said.
</P>
<P>
Another economist with a local consultancy pointed out that the
hike in interest rates in the region to prop up currencies will have
a dampening effect on consumer spending and investment, leading to a
further slowing down of economic activity.
</P>
<P>
The regional economies will have to contend with higher inflation
in the months ahead as import costs go up for both consumer items and
manufacturing inputs, he said.
</P>
<P>
Most analysts and economists interviewed said that while
Malaysia's growth prospects had been hit by recent events, economic
expansion of 7.5 to 8 percent was still possible this year.
</P>
<P>
So far the damage in Malaysia has been limited to the financial
markets, an economist noted. And this is not the first time it has
had a high current account deficit, he added.
</P>
<P>
As an emerging economy, Malaysia needs to bring in foreign
capital, and if it can continue to do so, things will settle down, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Full-year growth estimates for Thailand -- which triggered the
melt-down in the regional markets -- ranged from zero to 3 percent
this year, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
They predicted Singapore will achieve close to 7 percent growth,
helped by the recovery in the global demand for electronics.

DIANA'S DEATH HELPS BOOST REPUBLICAN MOVEMENT IN AUSTRALIA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Canberra,  Sept.  9  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Support for a republican movement in
Australia is winning solid ground following the death of Diana,
Princess of Wales.
</P>
<P>
In a poll taken following Diana's death, 53 percent of
Australians favored a republic against a monarchy, up 6 percent from
June 1996.
</P>
<P>
The support for a constitutional monarchy dropped to 37 percent
from 42 percent during the same period, according to the same poll.
</P>
<P>
The rising support for a republican Australia reflects anger
against the British royal family for not publicly displaying grief
for Diana until after heavy criticism.
</P>
<P>
A total of 21 percent of respondents said Diana's death had made
them think less highly of the Windsors.
</P>
<P>
Barry Jones, president of the Australian Labor Party, said he
felt some sense of relief that the constitutional convention would
not happen next week but next year.
</P>
<P>
"I would be disturbed if we were facing a constitutional
convention which began next week, because the background of emotions
would be very turbulent and it would make the whole exercise really
very highly charged," he said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer, who is also chairman of the
National Party, said the events following Diana's death might have an
effect on how Australians viewed the republic. "But ultimately,
Australians should make their own judgments on constitutional matters
relating to Australia," he said.
</P>
<P>
But the government leader in the Senate, Senator Robert Hill, has
become the highest ranking Coalition member to proclaim himself a
republican, defying his boss Prime Minister John Howard, who is
determined to keep the republic issue off the agenda in the run-up to
the next election.
</P>
<P>
Howard, a conservative and supporter of the constitutional
monarchy, has refused to make any concessions to secure the passage
of the convention legislation.
</P>
<P>
Hill's support came only a few days after former Prime Minister
Paul Keating made a speech at the University of New South Wales in
which he revived his campaign for a republic.
</P>
<P>
Keating, a champion of the republic, urged Australians to embrace
the republic because it was "right for us" and not "as a reaction to
external events or external perceptions."
</P>
<P>
Keating rejected as nonsense any idea that the identity of the
head of state has no impact on the way others perceive Australia.
</P>
<P>
"We do not give ourselves the chance we should have in Europe
while we still have the monarch of Great Britain as our head of
state," he said.

DIANA'S DEATH HELPS BOOST REPUBLICAN MOVEMENT IN AUSTRALIA
(Editors: this is part 2 of 2)
</P>
<P>
He said the image of Australia as a British branch office was
tenacious, but that a change to a republic would strengthen, not
weaken, the relationship. It would also open a fresh perspective on
Europe, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The choice to become a republic must be taken with courage and
grace. I say 'taken' because it is the act of taking which will give
our sovereign its strength," the former prime minister added.
</P>
<P>
Keating had set the date for Australia to become a republic for
no later than 2001. But his defeat in the March 1996 election to John
Howard is expected to delay that timetable.
</P>
<P>
And the right of about 500,000 British subjects to have a say in
whether Australia becomes a republic faces a challenge in the High
Court.
</P>
<P>
Preparations for the challenge were revealed Monday as the Howard
government said it was impossible to exclude British subjects from
the vote for next year's convention.
</P>
<P>
An Italian who came to Australia in 1960, Lorenzo Poletto, is
likely to initiate the challenge on behalf of non-British residents
who are excluded from the vote.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, he said he had so far declined to take out Australian
citizenship because of Australia's constitutional link to the British
monarchy.
</P>
<P>
"When Australia becomes a republic, I'll be the first to queue up
to become an Australian citizen," he said.
</P>
<P>
Even though with such an unfavorable change of the government,
many of the recently appointed delegates to the constitutional
convention have expressed their support for a republic.
</P>
<P>
Of the 76 delegates, 28 said they are committed to a republic
while only 17 delegates said they would support the constitutional
monarchy, and even some of these monarchists said they would consider
changing if a strong case were made for a republic.
</P>
<P>
Another 30 delegates are undeclared, although the majority of
these are sympathetic to change.
</P>
<P>
The convention to discuss whether Australia will move to become a
republic or remain a monarchy will be held in April or June 1998.
</P>
<P>
Australians for Constitutional Monarchy say this ballot will be
the real test of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Republican Movement said Australia should adapt to
the modern world and that it is ridiculous the British Queen is the
head of the country.
</P>
<P>
"Now we have to face the issue once and for all. Australia does
not need a foreigner as the head of its state," one official of the
movement said.
</P>
<P>
With a total population of about 18.6 million, Australia has one
of the most diversified nationalities in the world. It is a nation of
more than 130 nationalities, though the majority of its inhabitants
came originally from Britain.
</P>
<P>
Older migrants from Britain strongly support a monarchy for
Australia, but the younger generation backs a republic.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Republican Movement said it is confident that its
course of supporting an eventual republic for Australia will succeed.
"It is a matter of time only," a spokesman for the movement said.

SIEW CALLS FOR RESUMPTION OF KOO-WANG TALKS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  9  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Vincent Siew held out an olive
branch to rival communist China on Tuesday, calling for an early
resumption of "Koo-Wang talks" to pave the way for higher-level
consultations across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Siew made the appeal in his first administrative report to the
Legislative Yuan, which opened its new session last week.
</P>
<P>
Siew said the Koo-Wang talks, which refer to an April, 1993
meeting in Singapore between C.F. Koo, chairman of Taipei's Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF), and Wang Daohan, chairman of the
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS), provided an institutionalized channel for cross-strait
consultations.
</P>
<P>
However, Beijing unilaterally suspended regular SEF-ARATS
dialogue and canceled a planned second Koo-Wang meeting in mid-1995
to vent its anger over ROC President Lee Teng-hui's landmark visit to
the United States in that year, which Beijing interpreted as a veiled
move to promote Taiwan independence.
</P>
<P>
Siew said he earnestly hopes that the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait will shelve their disputes over sovereignty and resume the
Koo-Wang talks as soon as possible without any preconditions.
</P>
<P>
By resuming the talks, Siew said, the two sides can lay a solid
foundation for higher-level cross-strait consultations on a broader
range of issues.
</P>
<P>
Siew, who once served as Taiwan's top mainland policy planner and
represented President Lee Teng-hui at informal leadership meetings of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in 1993 and 1994,
said Taipei and Beijing should end their hostility and sign a peace
accord based on President Lee's "six-point proposal" and mainland
Chinese President Jiang-Zemin's "eight-point statement" on
cross-strait ties.
</P>
<P>
The lawmaker-turned-premier pointed out that Beijing's unilateral
suspension of SEF-ARATS consultations has resulted in a protracted
cross-strait impasse over the past two years, adding that if the
deadlock cannot be broken soon, the burgeoning cross-strait
rapprochement which has been forged through civilian exchanges in
recent years will be gradually eroded.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the promotion of cross-strait relations is high on
his political agenda, Siew said he hopes Beijing will drop its
hegemonic mentality and handle cross-strait affairs in a pragmatic,
reciprocal manner.
</P>
<P>
Siew also outlined his cabinet's other priority concerns --
improving public order, sustaining economic development, upgrading
the quality of living, boosting cultural and educational development
and beefing up the island's defensive capabilities.
</P>
<P>
He assured the lawmakers that the government will do its utmost
to bring to justice the key suspects involved in three unsolved
high-profile criminal cases -- the Mafia-style killing of former
Taoyuan County Magistrate Liu Pang-you and seven of his close aides,
the rape-murder of women's rights activist Peng Wan-ju and the
kidnap-murder of Pai Hsiao-yen, the 17-year-old daughter of
television celebrity Pai Ping-ping.
</P>
<P>
The government will also take other measures, including
modernization of the police administration, updating of criminal laws
and the investment of more resources in anti-crime operations, to try
to stem the crime rate and improve social order, Siew said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that upgrading living quality is an aspiration common to
most of the population, Siew said the government will give priority
to cleaning up the environment and improving traffic conditions so as
to provide a secure, clean and peaceful living environment.
</P>
<P>
Siew further said that although the newly passed package of
constitutional amendments no longer imposes a minimum 15 percent cap
on the government's annual educational and cultural budget, the
actual spending in this regard will still not fall below that level
and will even increase steadily in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
Siew said after his oral report to the legislature that he was
pleased to be able to smoothly complete his administrative report in
a generally peaceful milieu. "This marks a good start in relations
between the new cabinet and the legislature in which the ruling
Kuomintang holds hardly half seats," Siew said.
</P>
<P>
Siew's predecessor, Vice President Lien Chan, could not
deliver his administrative report durin gthe previous legislative
session due to boycotts from opposition legislators who didn't want
Lien to concurrently serve as vice president and premier.

ENDCAST FOR TODAY'S  CEP-1
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Panama  City,  Sept.  8 (CNA)
(By C. P. Huang and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Visiting ROC President Lee Teng-hui
delivered a speech at the Panamanian Legislative Assembly on Monday,
making him the first foreign head of state to address the Panamanian
congress.
</P>
<P>
In his one-hour speech, President Lee condemned Beijing for its
unceasing efforts to squeeze the Republic of China's international
space.
</P>
<P>
Lee said Beijing's hegemonic intervention is the only factor that
has discouraged many countries from recognizing the ROC. "Although
Beijing's constant intervention over the past five decades has
hindered the ROC from taking part in international activities fairly
and smoothly, it can never affect our determination to continue our
efforts to survive in the international arena and upgrade our
international profile."
</P>
<P>
The president went on to say that communist China's denial also
cannot undermine the ROC's existence as a sovereign state, adding
that Beijing's claim Taiwan is a province of the "People's Republic
of China" completely violates the fact.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the Chinese communist regime was founded in Beijing 37
years after the inception of the Republic of China. Moreover, the
communist regime has never ruled Taiwan for a single day.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the issues related to China's reunification, Lee
said that as long as communist China can pragmatically face up to the
reality that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are equal political
entities ruled by two separate governments, and as long as it
respects the ROC's legitimate right to participate in international
activities, the two sides will gradually move toward reunification
through good-will exchanges and positive interaction.
</P>
<P>
"We'll honor our commitment to promoting China's unification
under freedom and democracy with patience and concrete actions," Lee
pledged.
</P>
<P>
He further said the ROC earnestly hopes to play a more active
role in the international community and share its developmental
experience with other countries.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the ROC appreciates Panama's firm stance on inviting
him to attend the World Congress on the Panama Canal even though
Beijing had exerted strong pressure on the Panamanian government to
withdraw his invitation.
</P>
<P>
Lee said he is convinced that relations between the ROC and
Panama will be strengthened in the years ahead. He also reaffirmed
the ROC's commitment to doing its utmost to assist in the management
of the Panama Canal after Panama inherits the waterway from the
United States in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-six of the 72 members of the Panamanian Legislative
Assembly attended the special parliamentary session on Monday to
listen to Lee's speech. They gave Lee a standing ovation at the end
of his speech.
</P>
<P>
The speaker of the Panamanian Legislative Assembly later
announced that Lee's speech, delivered in both Chinese and Spanish,
will be included in the assembly's formal records.
</P>
<P>
Later that evening, Panamanian President Ernesto Perez Balladares
hosted a dinner in honor of Lee and his entourage.
</P>
<P>
Panama is the first leg of Lee's current four-country Latin
America tour, which will also take him to Honduras, El Salvador
and Paraguay. Lee is scheduled to leave here for Honduras for a
three-day state visit on Tuesday.

Jeffrey Koo, chairman of the
Taipei-based Overseas Investment Development Cooperation, said here
on Tuesday that around 6,000 job opportunities will become available
following the conclusion of the first two stages of construction of
Panama's planned Fort Davis export processing zone.
</P>
<P>
Koo, who is in charge of the Fort Davis development project, is
accompanying President Lee Teng-hui on an official visit to Panama.
He revealed that 22 businesses which have applied to invest in the
Central American country, are expected to set up operations in the
zone by next spring, when the first phase of construction work is
estimated to be completed.
</P>
<P>
At that time, the Taiwan heavyweight entrepreneur said, those
companies are expected to create 1,200 job opportunities in Panama.
</P>
<P>
The Fort Davis export processing zone is a joint-venture of the
Republic of China and Panama. President Lee and Panamanian President
Ernesto Perez jointly presided over an opening ceremony for the
still-under-construction zone on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lee, heading a high-profile delegation comprising key officials
in foreign affairs, economy and transportation, arrived here Saturday
for a four-day visit and to participate in the World Congress on the
Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
P.K. Chiang, chairman of the ROC's Council for Economic Planning
and Development and also a member of the delegation, told the CNA on
Tuesday that he has confidence in the profitability of the Fort Davis
zone.
</P>
<P>
Chiang said the zone will enjoy several advantages, including low
taxation, cheap labor, common circulation of the US dollar and a
convenient transportation system, which should encourage Taiwan
enterprises to invest in the region.
</P>
<P>
However, Chiang also noted that the language problem, along with
the great distance between Taiwan and Panama, could be major barriers

LET TAIWAN INTO WTO NOW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva,  Sept.  9  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The US government should recognize
Taiwan's considerable trade achievements and push for Taiwanese
membership in the WTO," Greg Mastel, Vice President of the US
Economic Strategy Institute, said in an article published by the
Journal of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
The history of this matter is long and complex. China, then the
Republic of China, was an original member of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT) -- the predecessor of the WTO. But after the
communists prevailed on the mainland, the nationalists were driven to
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In 1950, the nationalist government, still acting as the
recognized government of China, withdrew China from GATT. This move
left both mainland China and Taiwan outside the world trading system.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1990s, Taiwan launched an intense campaign to rejoin
the GATT. In doing so, it made two important initial concessions.
</P>
<P>
First, it offered to join the GATT without the special treatment
reserved for developing countries and assume all responsibilities of
membership at the outset while granting significant market access
concessions to the United States and other GATT members.
</P>
<P>
Second, recognizing mainland China's concerns, Taiwan identified
itself as a customs territory in its application, not an independent
country.
</P>
<P>
Mainland China was not satisfied, however. Though itself not a
WTO member, Beijing has lined up several WTO members to work against
Taiwan membership. The unstated compromise that the US and mainland
China quietly struck was that Taiwan would be allowed to join once
mainland China becomes a WTO member.
</P>
<P>
Once again, however, mainland China's WTO membership campaign is
showing signs of flagging. Not because, as mainland China contends,
the United States is blocking its membership, but because it is not
willing to make the concessions necessary to comply with the WTO,
Mastel said.
</P>
<P>
After months of promises to table a major offer, mainland China
has once again disappointed its trading partners by putting forward
an incomplete offer, which calls for a long phaseout of blatantly
WTO-illegal quotas. It didn't even bother to address market access
for services.
</P>
<P>
"There are still some outstanding trade issues with Taiwan
regarding agriculture, intellectual property some high tariffs and a
few other matters. No credible observer would deny, however, that
Taiwan's market is already much more open than mainland China's,"
Mastel said in his article.
</P>
<P>
"Beyond that, the United States already exports nearly twice as
much to Taiwan as to mainland China. Taiwan is an excellent candidate
for WTO Membership."
</P>
<P>
Mastel stressed that in light of mainland China's continued
failure to negotiate seriously, it is time for Washington to launch a
serious campaign for Taiwan's WTO membership, regardless of what
happens with mainland China's application.
</P>
<P>
In order to remain consistent with the "one China" policy, Taiwan
should continue seeking membership as a customs territory, not an
independent country. It is widely ignored now, but this formula was
used to bring Hong Kong (at the time, another Chinese province beyond
Beijing's control) into the GATT a decade ago without Chinese
objection; it should work now with Taiwan, Mastel pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Moving forward with Taiwan's WTO membership puts the burden on
mainland China to explain why a strong WTO candidate such as Taiwan
should remain outside the WTO simply because Beijing is unwilling to
comply with WTO entry requirements, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps this would force mainland China to finally open its
market or to accede to Taiwan's membership. Either outcome would be a
victory."

PREMIER: GOVERNMENT REFORM IS TOP PRIORITY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 9 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Government reform aimed at creating a "lean
and mean" administration is the top priority of the new cabinet,
Premier Vincent Siew said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In his first policy report to the Legislative Yuan, the new
premier quoted public opinion complaining that an excessive number of
administrative tiers and outdated bureaucracy have formed a barrier
to national development. Therefore, Siew said, the government will
make reform the top item on its agenda.
</P>
<P>
He outlined a seven-point strategy to make the government an
enterprise-like organization, including:
</P>
<P>
-- Streamlining of government structure by stopping gubernatorial
elections and reorganizing the provincial government;
</P>
<P>
-- Restructure of the central government, transforming it from a
rigid regulator into a high-quality service provider;
</P>
<P>
-- Regulation of the government's size and personnel count;
</P>
<P>
-- Revamping of the preparation of the government budget to raise
efficiency;
</P>
<P>
-- Computerization of government business in a bid to improve
government efficiency; and
</P>
<P>
-- Weeding out of corruption from government, increasing
transparency in the government's operation.
</P>
<P>
Responding to legislator's interpellations, Siew denied that his
Cabinet would ignore other problems while focusing its attention on
economy-related issues.
</P>
<P>
In addition to urging the police to solve several outstanding
high-profile criminal cases, the legislator-turned premier promised
his former colleagues that he will take steps to improve the police
educational system and modernize criminal investigation techniques.

TAIWAN DIVORCED RATE DOUBLED IN 15 YEARS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  9  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There were 37,000 divorces in 1996 in
Taiwan, or 1.7 for every 1,000 people, which is more than double the
1981 figure, according to recent government statistics.
</P>
<P>
Although lower than the 4.6 divorces per 1,000 people in the
United States and 2.5 per 1,000 people in Sweden, Denmark and Norway,
the figure is slightly higher than the 1.6 recorded for Japan and
South Korea, said the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS).
</P>
<P>
The statistics also show that 169,000 Taiwan couples tied the
nuptial knot in 1996, representing 7.9 couples per 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The average age for first marriages was 29.1 years for males and
26.6 years for females, 2.5 and 2.2 years older respectively than 10
years ago. The 2.5-year gap between males and females is also
narrower than the 3.2 years recorded in 1985.

MORE WOMEN WORKING FOR GOVERNMENT IN TAIWAN

<TEXT>
<P>
An increasing number of female citizens in
Taiwan have been working as public servants, which is believed to be
a stable job, over the past 20 years, the Ministry of Personnel (MOP)
under the Examination Yuan revealed on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Recent MOP statistics show that during the 20-year period between
1977 and 1996, the number of female public servants in Taiwan surged
to nearly 140,000, marking a significant 12.2 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
In comparison with this rise, the number of male public servants
grew by a mere 100,000 in the same period, the statistics show.
</P>
<P>
However, although more and more women have been working for the
government over the past few years, the MOP said that most public
servants are still male, pointing out that as of 1996, the number of
male public servants islandwide reached 381,116, accounting for 61.2
percent of the total, while there were 241,583 female government
workers, including public school teachers, accounting for 38.8
percent.

SIEW CALLS FOR DEVELOPMENT OF NORMAL CROSS-STRAIT TIES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 9 (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROC Premier Vincent Siew has said that both
Taiwan and mainland China should set aside the sovereignty issue and
do their best to develop a normal cross-strait relationship.
</P>
<P>
Siew, who assumed the premiership on Sept. 1, made the call in an
interview with Mike Chinoy, chief of CNN's Hong Kong Bureau, last
week. The text of the interview was broadcast twice on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Siew said that both the government and people of the Republic of
China want to improve relations with mainland China.
</P>
<P>
He said that improvements in cross-strait relations can be
achieved by increasing exchanges between the two sides and by
reopening the semi-official talks which were unilaterally suspended
by Beijing following ROC President Lee Teng-hui's visit to the United
States in 1995.
</P>
<P>
He urged Beijing to face the reality that Taiwan and mainand
China are divided and under the rule of two different governments and
to put aside the issue of sovereignty in order to restore normal
relations.
</P>
<P>
Siew said that Taiwan is very flexible on dialogues with mainand
China, not only on technical but also on political issues. "Our door
to the negotiating table is always open," he added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Taipei is hoping that a high-level exchange
of visits could also take place, provided that "our leaders... can
receive enough respect from the mainland authorities."
</P>
<P>
Siew also asserted that the "pragmatic diplomacy" that Taipei has
been pursuing is "no threat to the PRC's international status," but
is necessary for Taiwan's survival and development.

TAIPEI POLICE BUST CREDIT CARD FRAUD RING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  11 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei police recently cracked down on a
ring that pocketed millions by means of a scam involving counterfeit
credit cards.
</P>
<P>
The group raked in several dozen million New Taiwan dollars (more
than US$1 million), police sources estimated.
</P>
<P>
The police alleged that a Hong Kong man identified as Yu Teh-chi
organized the ring in March with eight Taiwanese and brought to the
island devices for counterfeiting credit cards.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the eight recruited locals to help Yu
swindle cash from banks by running up phony purchases using the
forged cards.
</P>
<P>
The police, which had been investigating the case since July,
arrested the nine suspects Thursday morning as they spoke with one of
their alleged accomplices.
</P>
<P>
Police seized 21 counterfeit credit cards and the equipment to
make more at Yu's place in suburban Taipei.
</P>
<P>
The cards were excellent forgeries and worked well, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB), Taiwan is
currently plagued by two major credit card rings: a Hong Kong ring
and a Singapore group.
</P>
<P>
A CIB official said the key members of both groups are all from
Hong Kong. The criminals, with an eye on Taiwan's large consuming
capability, allegedly purchased blank cards in mainland China and
completed the forgeries in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The rings have been expanding to Thailand and Malaysia, using
these as bases for making criminal inroads into Taiwan, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
The island's financial sector suffers losses of more than $NT400
million (around US$14 million) from credit card fraud every year, he
estimated.

SERIOUS TAX DEFAULT IN MAINLAND CHINA CAUSED BY RECESSION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 11 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Returns from value added tax and consumers
tax fell far short of their original targets for the first seven
months of this year in mainland China, reaching only 53.9 of their
goal and prompting the State General Administration of Taxation to
serve notice the other day requiring local tax bureaus to put a stop
to the increasing rate of tax defaults.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's Financial Times newspaper reported that from January to
July of this year, value added tax and consumers tax have been levied
for a little more than 22 billion yuan, representing only 53.2
percent of the target for value added tax and just 57.1 percent of
the target for consumers tax.
</P>
<P>
Blaming the majority of tax defaults on poor operation and
management of mainland China enterprises, the State Administration of
Taxation announced that from Sept. 1 no new tax defaults on the part
of enterprises will be permitted.
</P>
<P>
In cases where a business is in a very difficult operating
situation, its tax default should be reported to a higher taxation
organization for approval, while those enterprises with defaults of
more than five million yuan should obtain approval from the
provincial tax bureau.

Visiting ROC President Lee Teng-hui
delivered a speech at the Honduran National Congress on Wednesday,
appealing for world support for the Republic of China's participation
in the international community.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the ROC's existence and development is an undeniable

represents the whole of China.
</P>
<P>
Lee urged the rest of the world to face up to the reality that
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are currently ruled by two

Against this backdrop, Lee said, the international community
should support the ROC's participation in major international
organizations and activities.
</P>
<P>
Only by so doing can international society help China reunify
under the principles of "freedom, democracy and prosperity," Lee
asserted.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the ROC is more than willing to share with other
developing countries its experience in economic, political and social
development and reforms over the past decades.
</P>
<P>
Lee bemoaned the fact that "mainland China's constant pressure,
however, has seriously hindered our efforts to contribute to world
peace and prosperity."
</P>
<P>
The president went on to say the ROC's successful democratic
reforms have provided a good model for communist China to follow in
overhauling its obsolete political and economic systems.
</P>
<P>
Touching on ROC-Honduran relations, Lee said he feels honored to
have been invited to Honduras for a state visit, Lee's first to the
Central American country. He is also the first ROC head of state to
visit Honduras.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the ROC treasures its long-standing cordial relationship
with Honduras and appreciates the Honduran government's support for
the ROC bid to join the United Nations and other major world
organizations.
</P>
<P>
He also said he hopes his three-day visit will help reinforce
bilateral cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Lee's speech drew a warm response from Honduran lawmakers.
Congress President Carlos Roberto Flores Facusse said Honduras has
much to learn from Taiwan, emphasizing the island's economic
development and democratic reforms over the past five decades.
</P>
<P>
Flores, who will represent the Honduras' ruling Liberal Party in
the country's next presidential election scheduled for November, said
he holds similar political ideals and concepts to those of President
Lee. He also reaffirmed Honduras' firm support for the ROC's cause,
adding that Honduras will only make friends with countries which
respect freedom and human rights.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Lee paid tribute to Honduras' national
founding father before walking to the Honduran National Congress to
deliver his speech. A large number of Honduran people lined the
capital city's major streets to greet Lee.
</P>
<P>
Following his speech, Lee met with several influential Honduran
lawmakers for talks on a range of issues of mutual concern, including
ROC-Honduran ties, the general international situation and regional
cooperation programs.
</P>
<P>
Lee is scheduled to sign a joint communique with Honduran
President Carlos Roberto Reina before his departure for El Salvador
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Honduran Minister of Foreign Affairs Delmer Urbizo
denied on Wednesday that Honduras was "up for auction" in response to
Beijing's criticism of Central American nations' ties with Taipei.
</P>
<P>
"In the conduct of foreign affairs, we are loyal to our treaties
and our friends," Urbizo told reporters. "We are not up for auction
in the international arena. Being a small country doesn't mean that
we don't have great stature with regard to dignity and
responsibility."
</P>
<P>
Honduras is the second leg of Lee's current four-country Latin
American tour. He will leave for El Salvador on Thursday afternoon
for a four-day state visit, where he will attend a Central American
summit meeting in addition to meeting with Salvadoran President
Armando Calderon Sol and other Salvadoran officials.
</P>
<P>
The fourth and final leg of his tour will take the president and
his entourage to the South American country of Paraguay, where he
will make a three-day official visit before heading back to Taiwan
via a transit stop in Hawaii.

PANAMA PLAYING HOST TO A NEW ASIAN INTRIGUE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Ottawa,  Sept.  9 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Panama Canal has become the center of
an Asian arm-wrestling match -- one involving not Japan, but mainland
China and Taiwan, an analysis in the Toronto Star said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
And the atmosphere of seedy suspense and tension now beats any
thriller, Stephen Handelman wrote from New York.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the government of Panama launched a three-day
conference aimed at convincing the world of its ability to manage the
80-km canal when the United States cedes control of it on Dec. 31,
1999, Handelman said.
</P>
<P>
The conference was to mark the 20th anniversary of the 1977
treaty between Panama and the United States that set the date for a
handover as significant to Latin America as the reversion of Hong
Kong to mainland Chinese control was to Asia, he noted.
</P>
<P>
It was a crucial conference, first planned more than three years
ago, and Panama invited more than 20 heads of state to share the
moment. But only three leaders turned up, he reported.
</P>
<P>
One was President Lee Teng-hui of the Republic of China on
Taiwan, who arrived with 300 officials and businessmen and 200
journalists in the diplomatic style he has perfected since his
controversial visit to the United States, Handelman pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He said Lee's presence, not to mention the fact that Taiwan has
largely bankrolled the conference, meant mainland China would stay
away.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has been fuming for the past several years over Taiwan's
successful courtship of Central America, according to the Canadian
journalist. It nearly doomed a UN-sponsored truce in Guatemala
because of that country's support for Taiwan at the United Nations,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Taipei's Panama gambit was apparently the last straw. Mainland
China, the third-largest user of the canal, made clear it would look
on attendance at the conference as an unfriendly act. Only Honduras
and Nicaragua, two Central American nations that maintain diplomatic
relations with Taiwan, sent their leaders, he said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the shipping companies that make the canal a US$362
million-a-year enterprise did show up, along with VIPs from the
United States and other countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
But the geopolitical quarrel between the two Asian giants
deflated Panama's moment of glory, Handelman said. And it has added a
new and gratuitous strain to what is shaping up already to be a
hemispheric crisis-in-waiting, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
The underlying problem remains the doubt about whether Panama
will be able to control its destiny even when it takes charge of the
canal, he said.
</P>
<P>
"What we're seeing here already is the marketization of the
canal," he quoted one of the protesters outside this week's
conference who warned that Panama was again in danger of selling off
its national birthright to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The intrusion of Asian power politics into this combustible mix
doesn't help matters. But it's only another sign that the end of the
Cold War has not ended the shadowy intrigues inside this hemisphere,
Handelman commented.

CANADA TO DESTROY REMAINING LAND MINES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Ottawa,  Sept.  10  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Canada will destroy its entire stock of
land mines this fall before a treaty banning their use is signed in
December, Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy announced
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Canada will take immediate measures to ensure that all its
remaining anti-personnel mines are destroyed by the time the world
comes to Ottawa in December to sign a treaty banning these weapons,"
Axworthy said in Oslo.
</P>
<P>
Canada had already done away with two-thirds of its operational
stocks of anti-personnel mines. Wednesday's announcement applies to
the remaining mines.
</P>
<P>
The Oslo forum of non-governmental organizations is being held
alongside negotiations on a treaty to ban the use, manufacture,
stockpiling, transfer and sale of anti-personnel mines around the
world.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy gave a big push to the campaign for a worldwide ban last
fall when he announced in Ottawa that Canada would take a first step
by immediately destroying two-thirds of its operational stocks of
land mines.
</P>
<P>
Other countries have followed Canada's lead. Belgium, Germany and
Norway, for instance, have all announced they have destroyed -- or
will soon destroy -- their stocks of land mines.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of countries from around the world are in Oslo to
draft a treaty to rid the world of anti-personnel land mines in what
has become known as "the Ottawa Process."
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate there are 110 million unexploded mines buried
around the world. Every year, 25,000 people, mainly civilians, are
maimed or killed by stepping on a mine.
</P>
<P>
The Ottawa Process has the support of 107 countries so far,
although a few, such as the United States, are currently not wholly
committed.

Amid the heightened tension over
threatening remarks exchanged by the Turkish and Greek sides
concerning the transfer of Russian-made long-range S-300 missiles to
Cyprus, Russia joined the verbal duel Wednesday by saying that the
transfer of the weapons to Greek Cyprus cannot be prevented.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's semi-official Anatolia news agency reported from Moscow
that Russian President Boris Yeltsin's press officer, Sergey
Yastrjembski, said that Russia could easily transfer the missiles by
sea and would fulfill its commitment to bring the missiles to
southern Cyprus. Nothing could prevent the transfer of the missiles,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Yastrjembski said that the existence of Turkish troops on Cyprus
is illegal and that if these soldiers withdrew from the island Russia
could reverse its course and not deliver the missiles. He also
defended the sale of the missiles to Greek Cyprus, saying that they
would merely play a defensive role, the report added.

REGIONAL ECONOMIES WILL GAIN FROM CURRENCY CRISIS: PANELISTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Singapore,  Sept. 11 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The currency turmoil in Southeast Asia
is a "very healthy correction" and the region will emerge stronger
from the experience, said panelists at a forum in Singapore
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Manuel Montes, a senior fellow at the Institute of Southeast
Asian Studies of Singapore, which organized the forum, said the
recent events in Southeast Asia were not unusual and had been seen in
other places.
</P>
<P>
There were 46 balance of payment crises between 1980 and 1995, of
which 22 had been banking crises similar to that experienced by
Thailand recently, he said.
</P>
<P>
Montes pointed out that the Southeast Asian currency crisis
follows in the wake of the twin liberalizations: the liberalization
of the domestic financial system and the opening of the capital
account.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand there had been overexpansion of the domestic
financial system, financed by external funding, following these two
liberalizations, he said.
</P>
<P>
The external fund managers did not monitor their lending too
closely because they had been provided some guarantees against
exchange rate depreciation and because they were guaranteed they
could take out their profits at any time, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said one way of preventing a recurrence of the currency crisis
would be for governments to weaken these guarantees and to have more
flexible exchange rates. And such a step should be accompanied by
taxing short-term borrowing from abroad, he added.
</P>
<P>
This previous episode of strong capital inflows into the region
had been a problem for some of the countries because they have had to
resist the appreciation of their currencies.
</P>
<P>
Now they are quite comfortable that these currencies have
actually fallen, he said, noting it is good for their exports.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the recent turmoil would not have an adverse effect over
the medium to long term, he said it was probably not bad even for the
next six months.
</P>
<P>
However, he cautioned, if the markets continue to push the
currencies down, that could cause a second round of financial
problems.
</P>
<P>
P.K. Basu, director of Regional Macroeconomies at UBS Securities
Singapore, said the currency crisis had again highlighted that
information flows are important for proper functioning of the
markets.
</P>
<P>
He said he had observed a new phenomenon, which he called "market
fundamentalism," saying this was forcing the Southeast Asia's
economies to reduce their current account deficits to 1 percent of
gross domestic product, or below.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that regional economies deter excessive foreign
capital flows through floating foreign exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
Another economist pointed out that part of the problem had been
caused by the "exuberance" of foreign investors in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Some governments had encouraged this by announcing mega-projects,
giving the impression that high rates of growth were here to stay for
another five to 10 years, he noted.
</P>
<P>
All three panelists agreed that the worst of the currency crisis
is over.

Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
Chairman Chang King-yuh said here on Wednesday that Taiwan hopes to
build a harmonious and mutually beneficial relationship with mainland
China and that it is ready to resume dialogue with the mainland at
any time.
</P>
<P>
Chang, who arrived here on Tuesday for a four-day visit after

Panama City, made the remarks to members of the local Chinese press
at Twin Oaks, the site of the former Republic of China embassy in the

Although Taipei has repeatedly called on Beijing to reopen
bilateral talks, Chang said that the ball is now in Beijing's court,
as goodwill and willingness on both sides are necessary to rekindle
two-way talks.

Chang called on Beijing to drop the ideological struggle against
Taiwan and support the ideal raised by ROC President Lee Teng-hui
that "Chinese should help Chinese."
</P>
<P>
In addition to meeting American academics and holding seminars on
cross-strait ties during his visit, Chang will also call on local

COA TO STEP UP TORTOISE QUARANTINE

<TEXT>
<P>
The Council of Agriculture (COA) is
stepping up quarantine measures for soft-shell turtles as some
turtles at a western Taiwan farm have been discovered to be infected
with cholera.
</P>
<P>
But Lee Chien-chuan, COA vice chairman, said that there is no
cause for alarm, adding that the cholera virus -- identified as
vibrio cholera sero group 0139 -- will not survive cooking.
</P>
<P>
The virus will die after 15 minutes at a temperature over 75
degrees Celsius, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
The latest case involves soft-shell turtles from Chiaohsi, Ilan,
that were bound for export to Japan. Tests performed by the National
Quarantine Service under the Department of Health revealed the
animals were infected with cholera.
</P>
<P>
All turtles here have to pass through quarantine before being
exported.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that officials will review every aspect of the turtle
farms to try to pin down the source of the infection. Initial
suspects are baby turtles and feed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the COA will conduct a full-scale decontamination of
affected turtle farms and restrict both the movement of people
working at the farms and the transportation of turtles to stem the
spread of the potentially deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
The COA will also step up random tests at turtles farms in Ilan,
Changhua, Kaohsiung and Pingtung, the four major turtle farming areas
in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that before the most recent incident, no turtles had
been discovered infected with cholera since 1983, when the disease
was found in turtles to be exported to Japan. The exports were
stopped immediately, he added.

INTERNET POSES THREAT TO TELEPHONE COMPANIES
</HEADLINE>

Geneva,  Sept.  11 (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Internet has emerged as the greatest
single challenge to the traditional telephone business this decade,
according to reports of the Geneva-based International
Telecommunication Union (ITU) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts and consultants have warned that Internet features such
as Internet telephony -- which make possible free or almost free
international calls -- threaten to undermine the profitability of the
big telephone companies, but the ITU study is the first official
recognition of the danger.
</P>
<P>
The ITU, a specialized agency of the United Nations, said the
Internet is "opening up, for the first time, the possibility to offer
a range of interactive, multimedia services at an affordable price."
</P>
<P>
But it is worried that while the Internet could not survive
without the public telephone system, it is undermining the
operational and economic foundation of the telephone network.
"Arguably, the very network itself is now under threat," the ITU
report said.
</P>
<P>
It foresees a battle for control of the network between telecom
operators -- chiefly concerned with transmitting voice conversations
-- and Internet service companies, which specialize in data
transmission.

TIBETAN NUN TESTIFIES ON RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Sept.  10  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Tibetan nun told a US
congressional hearing on Wednesday that she was tortured and sexually
assaulted by mainland Chinese security police while in detention in a
prison near the Tibetan capital of Lhasa in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Tsultrim Dolma, 28, who escaped to India in December 1990, told
the House International Relations Committee during the hearing on
religious persecution that during 1987-88 she witnessed two incidents
in which mainland Chinese soldiers fired on peaceful Tibetan
demonstrators in Lhasa, killing many monks and lay people.
</P>
<P>
On April 16, 1988, six months after the second massacre, Dolma
and five other nuns demonstrated in Lhasa, calling for the release of
Tibetan monks and women with children. They were grabbed by mainland
Chinese soldiers and taken to a prison outside Lhasa. In the first
month of their more than four-month detention, they were beaten every
morning during interrogations.
</P>
<P>
She said the nuns were kept in separate rooms during the torture
sessions. She was repeatedly beaten to the ground and kicked. The
kicks in her chest were so painful that she could hardly breathe. One
soldier even inserted an electric cattle prod into her vagina.
</P>
<P>
"The shock and the pain were horrible. He repeated this action
several times and also struck other parts of my body. Later the other
soldiers made me stand and hit me with sticks and kicked me. Several
times I fell to the floor. They would then force the prod inside of
me and pull me up to repeat the beatings," she said.
</P>
<P>
Dolma counted 32 nuns and lay women at Gusta prison in the summer
of 1988. She learned that another of the nuns, Sonam Chodon, was also
sexually molested by soldiers.
</P>
<P>
In August 1988, Dolma was released and sent back to her village
for "re-education." Every night, she was required to attend a
self-criticism session.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen days after her release, a British journalist interviewed
her. When the documentary film became public, she felt her arrest was
imminent. Fear for her parents' safety, she decided to go to Lhasa to
appeal to Chupsang nunnery for readmission. But as she passed a
police compound near the nunnery, three soldiers on bicycles followed
and then raped her.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, one year after escaping to India, Dolma moved to the
United States. Asked what made a young Tibetan nun risk her life in
support of the Tibetan cause, she said it was the suffering of her
people she saw that gave her the courage to act as she did.

SINGAPORE'S GDP MIGHT GROW 7 PERCENT THIS YEAR

<TEXT>
<P>
Singapore's Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) should grow 7 percent this year, slightly higher than an
earlier estimate of 6.8 percent, regional economists said recently.
</P>
<P>
The increased forecast is expected to be sustained by strong
export recovery supported by an increased global electronics demand.
</P>
<P>
Their predictions for next year also remained fairly constant at
7.1 percent, slightly down on original projections of 7.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, estimates for Malaysia's GDP growth this year remained
almost unchanged at 7.9 percent, according to a poll of 12 regional
economists by Singapore's The Straits Times on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This is slightly lower than the 8 percent or higher forecast by
Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Most economists agreed that Singapore should emerge relatively
unscathed from the recent Southeast Asian currency turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Following a strong 7.8 percent growth in the second quarter of
this year, Singapore was already "on track" for an export-driven
rebound in the latter half of the year, they said.

<P>
Two key members of IBM's supercomputer
"Deep Blue" team, C.J. Tan and F.H. Hsu, arrived in Taipei on
Thursday for a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
During their short stay here, they will help people here better
understand the supercomputer which won an unprecedented victory over
world chess champion Garry Kasparov in a six-game match in May.
</P>
<P>
In line with their visit, IBM's Taiwan office on Sunday held a
chess competition, the six winners of which will receive prizes from
Tan and play a cross-ocean game with Deep Blue on Friday. The
challengers include three young students aged between 11 and 12 years
old.
</P>
<P>
Tan and Hsu, both originally from Taiwan, are important members
of IBM's Deep Blue team. They and their colleagues' immense efforts
led Deep Blue to defeat the Russian grand master. The supercomputer
lost to Kasparov in an earlier pairing in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Tan, a manager at IBM's Thomas Watson Research Center, took
responsibility for the Deep Blue program. After graduating from a
senior high school in Taipei, he went to the United States to pursue
a higher education, earning a doctorate in electronic engineering
from Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
Hsu, one of the original designers of Deep Blue, graduated from
National Taiwan University before going to the United States, where
he received his doctoral degree in computer science from
Carnegie-Mellon University.

The governor used to be a favorite of President Lee Teng-hui.
Tensions began to grow when Lee decided to marginalize the provincial
government...
</P>
<P>
To protest the move, Soong announced his withdrawal from all KMT
functions in July and boycotted all party events. He stayed away even
from the party's 15th National Congress in August by taking a
vacation in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, he won the highest number of votes in the party's
Central Committee elections at the congress.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps because the triumph made him feel better about his
relationship with the party, he paid a visit to Premier Vincent Siew
soon after he returned from his trip abroad.
</P>
<P>
Soong is one of the most popular statesmen on this island, a fact
evidenced by almost all public opinion polls conducted in recent
months. He has won wide grassroots support by working hard to fulfill
his duties to his constituents. But the central government's decision
to marginalize the provincial government dealt him a harsh blow.
Because of that decision, he is the last governor Taiwan will have.
Where will his future be?
</P>
<P>
The victory he won in the party congress' elections may have
restored his confidence in his future as a key member of the party.
</P>
<P>
Unity within the KMT is a stabilizing force for Taiwan society.
</P>
<P>
It is encouraging, therefore, that relations between Soong and
the other party authorities are in better shape.

Mainland China will continue to pursue
the goal of unification with Taiwan according to the principle of
"peaceful unification" and the "one country two systems" formula, a
spokesman said Thursday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Xu Guangchun, spokesman for the 15th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China (CPC), said at a press conference in
response to a question by CNA that this persistent policy will not
change.

Xu also quoted mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin as saying
in his eight-point policy toward Taiwan a few years ago that Beijing
would welcome Taiwan leaders to visit the mainland in their
"appropriate" capacity, and mainland leaders would be glad to accept
invitions to visit Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
However, Xu said such visits must be made under the "principle
of one China."
</P>
<P>
To make such visits meaningful, practical measures must be taken
to promote the development of cross-strait relations, Xu added.

TAIWAN CUTS RED TAPE ON FOREIGN INVESTMENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 11 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a bid to woo more foreign investors to
support the flagging domestic bourse, Taiwan authorities on Thursday
cut the bureaucratic red tape surrounding procedures for approving
ventures financed with foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
Liang Cheng-chin, deputy governor of the Central Bank of China
(CBC), unveiled the long-awaited measures at a news conference on
Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
Under the new guidelines, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
will have the exclusive power to approve foreign or overseas Chinese
investment with a value of below NT$1.5 billion (US$53.57 million)
without having to first consult the CBC.
</P>
<P>
This means that about 99.64 percent of total investment projects
will now be processed five to seven working days shorter than before,
when the MOEA was allowed to approve only those cases below NT$500
million (US$17.85 billion).
</P>
<P>
The bank also delegated to the Ministry of Finance the power to
examine investments by foreign institutional investors in the
domestic bourse if the sum of a single investment does not exceed
US$50 million and the accumulated investment of a single institution
does not exceed US$600 million.
</P>
<P>
The new rules will also apply to domestic security firms that
raise money from overseas via mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
The CBC estimated the new procedures will shorten the approval
period by as much as two weeks, although only five such cases have
been recorded over the last year.
</P>
<P>
Liang said that the rules, coming after the Taiwan Stock Market
shed nearly 1,000 points in a single week, is expected to improve the
attraction of the Taiwan bourse to foreign investors.

The 15th National Congress of the

Informed sources had earlier said that in order to make an

organization and central leaders. He said he "did not hear anything

FORMER CCP CHAIRMAN NOT PRESENT AT 15TH CONGRESS

(By Eva Chen)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Chairman of the Chinese Communist
Party (CCP) Hua Quofeng did not show up at the opening session of the
15th National Congress of the CCP, reflecting the fading importance
of the conservatives in the party and the fact that the third
generation of the party's leadership, with Jiang Zemin at its core,
has bid farewell to the old era and is ushering in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Hua inherited the title in 1976 at the behest of the late party
chairman, Mao Zedong. Hua did take part in the 14th Party Congress
five years ago, when he was elected to the Central Committee, but it
appears that Hua is no longer a representative of the CCP.
</P>
<P>
With the "three favorables" (favorable to developing the
productive forces in socialist society, to consolidating China's
comprehensive national strength and to raising people's living
standard) being held as the new criteria for promoting reform, and
with "beware the rightists but guard mainly against the leftists"
being written into the policy report of the 15th congress, Hua's
departure from the political arena is being viewed in some quarters
as an attempt by the CCP to distance itself from all the wrongs done
by past generations of the CCP.

MOFA TO FORM TASK FORCE ON FISHERIES

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has
decided to set up a task force to handle matters concerning
fisheries, Wu Shing-chiang, director general of MOFA's Economic and
Trade Affairs, said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the task force was formed to promote the development of
deep-sea fisheries, respond quickly to fishery disputes in
international waters, handle maritime emergencies and facilitate
communication with other nations regarding fishing rights.
</P>
<P>
Wu noted that the ROC now has the world's sixth-largest fishing
industry in the world, behind only Russia, Japan, Spain, Poland and
South Korea, and that the might of Taiwan's fishing industry has
become too powerful to be ignored.
</P>
<P>
However, as fishing restrictions on the high seas have become
increasingly strict and fishery agreements have expanded to include
fishery technology cooperation and assistance, the administration of
the fishing industry has become more complicated than fishing
 itself.
</P>
<P>
The task force will also be able to respond quickly to accidents
in international waters to protect fishermen's rights. Several cases
of fishing vessels erroneously entering the territorial waters of
foreign counters and cases of murders at sea have been reported in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
The task force will aim to develop talent in dealing with fishery
matters, with the hope that they can help develop deep-sea fishing in
the long term and be more effective in negotiation with other nations
on fishing-related matters.

DONOR A COMMUNIST CHINA AGENT, PANEL REPORTEDLY TOLD

Top US legal and intelligence
officials told the Senate Government Affairs Committee on Thursday
that an executive of a Chinese-language newspaper in Southern
California who has had close contact with President Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore attempted to influence the US election on behalf of
the (communist) Chinese government, the Los Angeles Times reported on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Ted Siong, an Indonesian entrepreneur whose family owns the
International Daily News in Monterey Park, has emerged as a key
player in a covert scheme to expand China's influence in the US
political process, according to intelligence data. But the evidence
remains in dispute and it has not been proved that Siong acted on
behalf of Beijing," a committee source was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The daily said in a Washington datelined report that
"investigators are looking at contributions by Siong's daughter and
family companies to both political parties -- including a US$250,000
contribution to the Democratic National Committee in 1996 and
US$50,000 to the National Policy Forum, a GOP-linked think-tank, in
1995."
</P>
<P>
The Senate committee received the information, first outlined by
the Times in May, in a closed-door briefing by Attorney General Janet
Reno, FBI Director Louis J. Freeh, CIA Director George J. Tenet and
National Security Agency Director Kenneth A. Minihan, according to
committee sources.
</P>
<P>
It also said: "Siong, who lives in Asia, could not be reached to
comment but on Thursday night his attorney vehemently denied that
Siong or any member of his family had acted on behalf of the Chinese
government or in any improper way."
</P>
<P>
"Neither Ted Siong nor Jessica Elnitiarta (Siong's daughter) have
ever been agents of the Chinese government or any government,"
Washington attorney Mark J. MacDougall was quoted as saying. "Any
money they ever gave was their own money."
</P>
<P>
"But sources familiar with the ongoing investigation say that
Siong apparently came under suspicion because of evidence gathered
from secret Chinese communications from Beijing to the Chinese
embassy in Washington," the Times reported.

<P>
El Salvador President Armando
Calderon Sol on Friday reiterated his country's support for the
Republic of China's bid to rejoin the United Nations, saying that
this is in line with El salvadors long-term policy.
</P>
<P>
In a joint press conference following the signing of a joint
communique with visiting ROC President Lee Teng-hui, Calderon said he
will call on the UN to admit the ROC as a member when he attends its
general assembly meeting on Sept. 23.
</P>
<P>
He denied that his country has been under pressure from Beijing
for inviting Lee to participate in a summit of six Central American
states on Saturday, and will not bend under any such pressure in the
future.
</P>
<P>
Calderon said any dispute between Taipei and Beijing should be
solved through peaceful negotiations on the basis of mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
President Lee stressed at the press conference that the ROC is a
sovereign state and that only when Beijing acknowledges this fact can
any meaningful negotiation start between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
In response to mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin's call for
Taiwan to start talks with mainland China under the principle of "one
China," Lee said Beijing has to admit first that the `one China' is
now divided and ruled by two separate governments, referring to
Taipei and Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He also defended his country's "pragmatic diplomacy" which
enables the ROC to maintain substantive relations through
semi-official representative offices with more than 140 countries
which don't recognize it diplomatically.

<P>
Lee said that pragmatic diplomacy, as well as the safeguarding of
security and strengthening of democracy, are the pillars of Taiwan's
survival.
</P>
<P>
The first ROC president ever to set foot in El Salvador said that
"head of state diplomacy," a term coined by Taiwan's mass media to
refer to Lee's overseas trips in person, is not aimed at buying
friendship around the world, but rather at sharing Taiwan's
experiences as a developing economy and democracy with other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan can help El Salvador develop its agriculture, and Taiwan's
private sector investment in the Central American country will forge
stronger ties than official aid and loans could ever do, said Lee.
</P>
<P>
Lee and his 200-strong entourage of officials and business
leaders arrived in El Salvador on Thursday on the third leg of a
four-nation 16-day visit to Latin America.

DILEMMA FOR BEIJING AMID MOUNTING CALLS FOR POLITICAL REFORM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  13 (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing is currently facing a dilemma in
the face of mounting internal calls for political reform, Lin
Chung-pin, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), said
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Lin said at a press conference that the appeals for political
reform are the first of their kind to be heard in mainland China
since the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre and that Beijing so far has
not taken any action to either silence the voices or arrest the
people making the calls.
</P>
<P>
He said that people's demands for political reform might have
been triggered by similar calls from within the Chinese Communist
Party (CCP).
</P>
<P>
If Beijing's leaders choose to tolerate the situation, the trend
may well continue and even develop into large-scale demonstrations;
but if they move to crack down on the dissidents, the ongoing
economic reforms will inevitably be damaged, Lin analyzed.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that it's very difficult to judge how the mainland
political situation will be in the future, adding that whether
Beijing will react positively to the calls remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that mainland Chinese President and CCP General
Secretary Jiang Zemin is "faring well" in ruling the mainland.
However, he said, Jiang is still lagging "far behind" Mao Zedong or
even his mentor and patron, Deng Xiaoping, in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Saying that Taiwan will be more than happy to see Beijing
maintain political stability, Lin said that the MAC cannot, and will
not, predict the political situation on the mainland one or three
years after the conclusion of the CCP's 15th congress, which opened
on Friday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He said that Taipei will continue keeping a close watch on the
situation on the mainland, especially from the following indicators:
</P>
<P>
-- whether Wu Bangguo, a key member of the co-called "Shanghai
Group" led by Jiang actually becomes a standing member of the CCP
Politburo while retaining his vice premiership and whether other
members, such as Huang Ju and Zeng Qinghung, are appointed members of
the Politburo;
</P>
<P>
-- whether the "old guard" like 81-year-old Liu Huaqing and
83-year-old Zhang Zhen really step out of the political arena and
whether Chi Haotian remains a Politburo member;
</P>
<P>
-- whether Qiao Shih, Beijing's No. 3 man, yields his position
and power to the younger generation and how much, if any, he gives;
</P>
<P>
-- whether Zhu Rongji, now a vice premier, becomes premier;
</P>
<P>
-- whether the ongoing 15th congress ends as scheduled on Sept.
18;
</P>
<P>
-- whether the military increases its presence in the CCP Central
Committee;
</P>
<P>
-- whether the CCP reinstates its chairmanship;
</P>
<P>
-- how Beijing responds to the calls for political reform; and
</P>
<P>
-- how Beijing reforms its ailing state-run enterprises.

CPC CHAIRMAN MENTIONS `GUARDING AGAINST LEFTISTS'

<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang Zemin, chairman of the Chinese
Communist Party (CPC) in his report at the opening session of the
15th National Congress, specifically mentioned the basic line and
guiding significance of Deng Xiaoping's theory, actually quoting
Deng's warning to "beware the rightists, but guard mainly against the
leftists."
</P>
<P>
Jiang in the past has always been very careful to avoid using the
term "guard against the leftists," so its inclusion in his speech at
the current congress makes its political meaning especially
noteworthy.
</P>
<P>
In his reassertion of Deng's viewpoint, Jiang's aim seems to be
to adhere to Deng's theory and the basic line of the CPC. By using
the expression, it is clear that Jiang has rejected the pressure he
faced prior to the convening of the national congress and it would
appear that the prospects for the party's leftists are poor.

ROC AND  EL SALVADOR SIGN JOINT COMMUNIQUE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
San Salvador, Sept. 12 (CNA)
(By Huang Chau-ping and Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Visiting Republic of China President
Lee Teng-hui and El Salvador President Armando Calderon Sol vowed in
a joint communique on Friday to further strengthen economic and trade
ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In addition to exchanging eulogies on the other country's
political and economical accomplishments, the two heads of state also
asserted that international conflicts should be resolved through
peaceful dialogue and that every country should abide by the rules
accepted by the international community to maintain international
security and world peace.
</P>
<P>
Lee thanked El Salvador for its firm support for the ROC's bid to
rejoin the United Nations and other international organizations ,
while Calderon confirmed his country's support for the ROC.
</P>
<P>
Both countries reiterated their intention to establish an export
processing zone and an industrial park in El Salvador and promised to
urge private firms to participate in the project.
</P>
<P>
Lee also promised to improve El Salvador's access to ROC markets
to address the imbalance in two-way trade.
</P>
<P>
Before signing the joint communique, Lee delivered a speech to
the El Salvador parliament.
</P>
<P>
In the speech, Lee said the ROC believes China will be eventually
united on the basis of freedom, democracy and equal distribution of
wealth, rather than Beijing's "one country, two systems" formula.
</P>
<P>
He blamed Beijing's hegemonic mentality as the biggest obstacle
blocking the development of amicable ties between Taipei and Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Although he tried to reach out to Beijing by expressing his
willingness to visit mainland China in his inaugural address in May
1996, Beijing replied by beefing up its efforts to isolate Taiwan in
the international community, said Lee.
</P>
<P>
As a sovereign state, Lee said that the ROC is entitled to take
part in international activities and is willing shoulder its
international responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
Lee arrived in El Salvador on Thursday for a five-day visit,
where he will attend a summit of five Latin American states on
Saturday. This is the third leg of his four-nation 16-day Latin
American tour which has already taken him to Panama, Honduras and
will bring him to Paraguay on Sunday.

COMMONWEALTH SUGGESTED FOR TAIWAN, HONG KONG, MAINLAND CHINA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China could
consider the idea of forming a commonwealth to help assuage mistrust
and misgiving, a prominent Taiwan business magnate said here
recently.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yung-ching, chairman of Formosa Plastics Group, said in an
article published in the Taiwan Daily News on Saturday that under the
system, members of the commonwealth would continue to maintain their 
long-term cooperative and competitive relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that in this way, the "ultimate goal of the Chinese
in 21st century" could be realized.
</P>
<P>
The business tycoon, who raised great controversy and forced a
government review of investment policy in the mainland after
announcing plans to build a US$3 billion thermal power plant in
coastal Fujian province earlier this year, noted that Taiwan and
mainland China have been under separate rule for decades and that
neither side is subordinate to the other.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the "two brothers" have developed different
social, political and economic systems, and have shown considerable
difference between them.
</P>
<P>
Though the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait share common
ancestors and both sides agree that there is only one China, they
have to take into consideration the fact that separate development is
in the best interest of both sides at present, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
This being the case, Wang suggested that Taiwan, mainalnd China
and Hong Kong form a commonwealth to help ease mutual mistrust and
misgivings.
</P>
<P>
He said it is understandable for mainland leaders to claim that
Taiwan is part of the People's Republic of China. But he cited the
examples of Britain, Russia and Japan which had dedicated themselves
to expansionism, but in the end had to face failure.
</P>
<P>
Wang pointed out that the Republic of China on Taiwan has been in
existence for several decades and that it has never been under the
jurisdiction of the mainland for a single day.
</P>
<P>
Under these circumstances, he said, the people of Taiwan find it
difficult to accept the claim that Taiwan is a province of
communist China.
</P>
<P>
Wang said he believes that with the commonwealth, Taiwan, Hong
Kong and provinces of mainland China, with their different experience
and conditions, will form a complementary and closely cooperative
relationship.
</P>
<P>
In this way, the gap between the three will narrow, and
eventually there will be an equal and balanced development in every
way. Future generations, with full confidence in their fates, will be
able to meet the challenges of the next century, Wang concluded.

El Salvador President Armando
Calderon Sol said on Friday that his country is planning to build a
700-hectare industrial zone, and that he welcomes Taiwan investment in
the zone.
</P>
<P>
Calderon made the remarks during a reception for business leaders
from the Republic of China who are currently accompanying President
Lee Teng-hui on his four-nation Latin American trip.
</P>
<P>
President Lee had suggested that Calderon meet with the Taiwan
businessmen during talks on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kao Chin-yen, chairman of the Chinese National Federation of
Industries, quoted Calderon as saying that El Salvador welcomes
Taiwan investment in his country and is willing to provide a
700-hectare plot for development into an industrial zone.
</P>
<P>
Kao cited the examples of Subic Bay, in the Philippines and Fort
David, in Panama, adding that if Taiwan businessmen can pool their
resources, the chances of success will be greater.
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Koo, chairman of the Chinese National Association of
Industry and Commerce, said that Taipei-based Overseas Investment
Developing Corp. could send a delegation to review the proposed plan.
</P>
<P>
Y.D. Sheu, governor of the Central Bank of China, said the ROC
government and businessmen know that they have to unite to succeed,
adding that the Taipei-based International Commercial Bank of China
will send representatives to Central America from time to time to
provide service to Taiwan businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan businessmen are reluctant to invest in Central America
because of language problems and geographical location. But Kao said
El Salvador has the most solid industrial basis in Central America,
as well as the highest quality of labor.
</P>
<P>
Wang You-cheng, chairman of the Ceneral Chamber of Commerce of
the ROC, quoted Calderon as saying that El Salvador will also provide
assistance to Taiwan businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Wang also suggested that El Salvador sign investment guarantee
agreements with Taiwan and provide incentives for investment to
attract more Taiwan businessmen.

SINGAPORE  LOOKING  AT  5  MILLION  POPULATION

<TEXT>
<P>
The Singapore government is looking at
a "four, five million" population for Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The government will review the long-term population growth target
of four million, Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng disclosed
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Singapore needs more foreigners to sustain its economic growth as
it cannot produce enough people for the workforce each year, he said
in an interview with The Straits Times.
</P>
<P>
He said that what mattered was not the actual figure, but whether
Singapore would be able to find the right kind of people to sustain
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's current population comprises about three million
Singaporeans and 560,000 foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Wong pointed out that while 56,400 babies were needed last year,
only 46,700 were born.
</P>
<P>
This meant that Singaporeans had an average 1.7 babies per woman,
which fell short of the 2.1 each family needed to replace itself.
</P>
<P>
These figures show that Singaporeans cannot even replace
themselves, let alone increase population growth.

AUSTRALIA TO SPEARHEAD CAMPAIGN FOR WORLDWIDE SANCTUARY FOR WHALES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Canberra,   Sept.   13   (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Australia will spearhead an
international campaign for a worldwide sanctuary for whales and
confront Japan and Norway to end commercial whaling, Environment
Minister Robert Hill said recently.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters Australia would lead the world to end
commercial whaling and that the global sanctuary will be promoted at
the annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in
Monaco next month.
</P>
<P>
He said the sanctuary would amount to a blanket moratorium on
commercial whaling in the absence of enforceable international laws.
</P>
<P>
The only water not covered by the sanctuary would be each coastal
nation's 12-nautical-mile territorial zone.
</P>
<P>
The decision by Australia to end commercial whaling comes in
response to a national task force report on whaling which recommends
the global sanctuary or, as a lesser option, a 50-year moratorium on
commercial whaling.
</P>
<P>
The IWC figures show as few as 200 blue whales left in the oceans
of the southern hemisphere and only 550 humpbacks in the western
North Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
Yet nations, including Norway and Japan, continue to kill whales,
purportedly for research, while others have joined them in pressing
for a resumption of commercial whaling.
</P>
<P>
Hill promised to carry the fight to Japan and Norway, beginning
in Monaco.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Norway reported taking 503 whales for 730 tons of meat,
while Japan, through its international cetacean research
organization, admitted to killing 440 whales for 1,995 tons of meat.
</P>
<P>
"There is no humane way to kill whales and there is simply no
need to harvest these beautiful and graceful animals," he said.
</P>
<P>
The new global sanctuary proposed by the task force would extend
the existing whale sanctuaries in the Southern and Indian oceans,
within which the taking or killing of whales and other protected
species is prohibited.
</P>
<P>
"Ideally we would like a global whale sanctuary to include all
waters up to the low-water mark, but we recognize that this would
involve significant difficulties with national sovereignty," the task
force report stated.

GAS EXPLOSION IN KAOHSIUNG KILLS THREE, INJURES 22

<TEXT>
<P>
A huge gas explosion has killed three
people and injured another 22 in the southern Taiwan city of
Kaohsiung on Saturday morning, according to police reports.
</P>
<P>
More than four stores and houses near the site of the explosion
were engulfed in an inferno and dozens of cars parked by the roadside
were destroyed by the explosion and ensuing fire which was not
brought under control until around noon.
</P>
<P>
The blast at 9:13 a.m. was caused by liquefied petroleum gas
which leaked from a stretch of underground gas pipes, according to
a preliminary inspection.
</P>
<P>
Workmen were rerouting the 12-inch-diameter gas pipes as part of
a road-widening project and had halted the gas supply before cutting
the pipe.
</P>
<P>
However, although the workers had tried to clear the gas
remaining in the pipe and believed there was no gas left, passersby
and nearby residents reported a strong smell of gas shortly before a
series of three huge explosions occurred and flames spewed out of the
pipe.
</P>
<P>
One motorcyclist was killed immediately and another two charred
bodies were found nearby. Twenty-two others, including passersby,
pipe workers and firefighters suffered various degrees of burn, some
serious.

IS MAINLAND CHINA STILL COMMUNIST?
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Ottawa,  Sept.  12  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Can mainland China still claim to be
communist even as it liquidates its state sector? asked Canada's The
Globe and Mail in an editorial on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Heck yes," The Mail answered itself. "Public ownership does not
mean state ownership," the newspaper quoted party ideologue Xing
Bensi as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jian of the State Planning Commission has another
explanation. He says the state does not have to own a large share of
the economy to play a "leading role," as communists have always
demanded.
</P>
<P>
Still another government economist was quoted: "Socialism means
becoming prosperous together. It means the development of productive
forces."
</P>
<P>
"Ah," exclaimed the Mail.
</P>
<P>
The editorial was expressing its amazement at a communist country
where peasants could own their land, businessmen could run their
factories, workers could sell their labor to whomever they wanted and
the economy planned itself.
</P>
<P>
"Most countries call this capitalism," the article claimed.
Mainland China calls it the "socialist market economy." Why
"socialist?" Because, despite all the market reforms, the state still
owns the commanding heights of the economy, it said.
</P>
<P>
The trouble is that those heights are crowded with slums --
between one-half and two-thirds of mainland China's 118,000
state-owned enterprises are, so to speak, in the red, it pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The editorial was entitled "So that's communism." The Mail's
China Bureau reported that the world's largest political party set
sail for the 21st century on Friday, struggling to remain relevant
long after abandoning the socialist beliefs that gave it life.
</P>
<P>
The Ottawa Citizen's Asia correspodent Jonathan Manthorpe said
President Jiang Zemin will try to convince party followers that
selling off moribund state industries is not privatization, but a
step on the road to socialism.
</P>
<P>
The question of how to finesse the departure from centrally
planned economics has been the most divisive and troubling issue as
inner circles have met in recent weeks to prepare for Friday's
opening of the 15th Chinese Communist Party Congress, Manthorpe
pointed out.

JIANG'S ANNOUNCED TROOP REDUCTION REVEALS UNDISPUTED LEADERSHIP

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the
Communist Party of China, proclaimed that mainland China's armed
forces personnel will be cut by half a million within three years to
2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
Even so, the total number of people in the mainland Chinese army
will remain greater than the 2.4 million of 1959, when the mainland
economy was in great distress.
</P>
<P>
During his tenure as chairman of the Central Military Commission,
Deng Xiaoping ordered the armed forces trimmed of one million men and
women 12 years ago; now Jiang, after eight years in the same post,
has also embraced the idea of troop reductions, indicating that his
power as commander-in-chief is undisputed.
</P>
<P>
In the early years of the communist regime, mainland China
maintained 5.5 million regular troops. A Joint Staff meeting held in
June 1950 decided to reduce the regular army to four million. But
with the outbreak of the Korean War the figure jumped to 6.27 million
instead.
</P>
<P>
With the strengthening of Jiang's leadership in the military
sphere, his philosophy of "quality instead of quantity" in military
matters seems to be gaining ground.

COLLECTIVE LEADERSHIP OF FOURTH GENERATION TO BE BUILT SOON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chinese Communist Party will complete
the shuffle of its leadership before the close of its 15th National
Congress on Thursday, bringing in new blood, according to a Hong Kong
monthly.
</P>
<P>
In its latest issue, The Mirror said that the current congress
has been working to construct a power core of the third generation
that will be gradually ferried to the collective leadership of the
fourth generation.
</P>
<P>
The center of policy making will receive new blood and the old
guard will retire gradually, the report said. These new leaders will
mainly belong to the fourth generation, so that a new ruling
generation will be established smoothly, it said.
</P>
<P>
What Li Peng's political prospects will be once his second term
as premier expires soon and whether Qiao Shi will be willing give up
his post as chairman of the National People's Congress to Li remain
to be seen, The Mirror observed.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's recent emphasis on the struggle against corruption
means it is likely that the Central Commission for Discipline
Inspection (CCDI) will regain the higher position and role it enjoyed
before the 13th party congress, the monthly said.
</P>
<P>
This means that Standing Committee members of the Political
Bureau may also be CCDI members, it said. Therefore, Li Peng's new
job most probably will be either chairman of the National People's
Congress or general secretary of the CCDI, the monthly predicted.

He went on to say that the activities will also help those
foreigners, who mistake Taiwan for another Hong Kong, recognize that
the two places and their situations are very different.

When the "Celebrate Taiwan Week" activities were held for the
first time last year, many foreign reporters came to cover the event
and the deputy mayor of New York and some European UN officials
visited the display, Chang said.
</P>
<P>
This year's activities, which will be held in New York on Sept.
14-16 and Washington D.C. Sept. 18-20, will include an exhibit of
Taiwan photos, performances of Taiwanese folk dances and a fair
displaying Taiwanese puppets, costumes, dough sculptures, lanterns
and bamboo weavings.

NAME OF CETRA'S BRANCHES CHANGED TO TAIWAN TRADE CENTER

<TEXT>
<P>
Each overseas branch office of
Taiwan's China External Trade Development Council (CETRA) will now be
called the "Taiwan Trade Center."
</P>
<P>
Chen Yi-ren, director of the Taiwan Trade Center in San
Francisco, said Saturday that the name change, by giving foreign
businessmen a clear notion of the meaning and function of CETRA's
overseas offices, will be conducive to the promotion of bilateral
trade.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that currently CETRA has 43 offices around the world.
In the past, CETRA branch offices in countries maintaining diplomatic
relations with the ROC used the council's formal name, while those in
other countries were known as Far East Trade Service Centers.
</P>
<P>
As the number of ROC diplomatic allies is limited and "Far East
Trade Service Center" failed to give people a quick link to Taiwan,
CETRA decided to rename its overseas branches Taiwan Trade Centers
and took action accordingly, he said.

<P>
President Lee Teng-hui
of the Republic of China and the heads of state of five Central
American countries and Belize signed a joint communique on Saturday
in a summit meeting, agreeing to jointly set up a strategic alliance
to strengthen bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The five countries -- Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala,
Honduras and Nicaragua -- along with Belize agreed to let the ROC
join the System of Central American Integration (know as SICA in
Spanish) for mutual benefits.
</P>
<P>
ROC Foreign Minister John Chang called the accord a remarkable
step forward in foreign relations, while ROC government spokesman
David Tawei Lee described it as a "landmark" event.
</P>
<P>
According to Chang, SICA is a regional trade and political
grouping similar to the European Union. As a member, the ROC will be
able to help the other countries in the grouping with their economic
development, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ROC and the six countries also reached consensus at the
summit to set up a US$300 million Central American development fund,
Chang said. He noted that the ROC will raise US$240 million, while
the other nations will jointly contribute the remaining US$60
million.
</P>
<P>
Chang stressed that the ROC government is very willing to
contribute to the international community in return for the
assistance it received from it before, and said the establishment of
the fund will help cement its ties with those countries.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the Taipei-based International Commercial Bank
of China (ICBC) inked an agreement with the Central American Bank for
Economic Integration (CABEI), under which the ICBC will provide a
US$10 million loan each to Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras,
Guatemala and Nicaragua to help those countries develop their small
and medium business sector.
</P>
<P>
CABEI was set up in Honduras in 1960. The ROC joined CABEI in
1991, becoming the first non-regional member of the bank.
</P>
<P>
CABEI President Jose Manuel Bacas Castro hailed the ICBC's US$50
million loan, expressing the belief that the fund will play a
significant role in the economic development of countries in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Salvadoran Economic Minister Eduardo Iabalah expressed
satisfaction with the results achieved in the just-concluded summit.
</P>
<P>
Iabalah told CNA that the many trade, commerce and technological
cooperation agreements signed by the attending countries will lay a
solid foundation for future economic cooperation and are additional
proof of long-standing friendly ties among them.

Taiwan is the third-largest buyer of
American products in Asia and supports a greater number of job
opportunities in the United States than mainland China does,
according to the latest statistics released by the US Department of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
The statistics show that Taiwan imported US$9.49 billion worth of
US products in the first half of this year, becoming the
eighth-largest market for US exports, while mainland China was the
United States' 15th-largest outlet, importing US$5.81 billion worth
of US goods.
</P>
<P>
An analysis by the US Commerce Department on links between
foreign trade and the labor market indicates that Taiwan supported
about 161,000 jobs in the United States during the first six months
of 1997, nearly twice as many jobs as mainland China contributed.
</P>
<P>
According to the analysis, each US$1 billion in US exports helps
maintain 17,000 job opportunities in the local labor market.
</P>
<P>
Although US exports to Taiwan have been growing, the increase
rate of US exports to the island has slowed in recent years,
according to the same tallies. The ratio of US exports to Taiwan as a
percentage of the total dropped from 3.6 percent in 1995 to 3.2
percent in the first half of this year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Republic of China signed an
economic cooperation agreement with the five members of the Central
American Common Market on Saturday as part of its efforts to
reinforce ties with the region.
</P>
<P>
The ROC and five of its Central American allies -- El Salvador,
Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala and Costa Rica -- also agreed that the
accord will lay a foundation for the eventual signing of a Free Trade
Agreement (FTA) among the six countries.
</P>
<P>
The new cooperation pact was signed by ROC Minister of Economic
Affairs Wang Chih-kang and his counterparts from the five Central
American countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was one of the achievements of the just-concluded
ROC-Central American summit meeting, which brought together ROC
President Lee Teng-hui, Salvadoran President Armando Calderon Sol,
Guatemalan President Alvaro Arzu, Costa Rican President Jose Maria
Figueres, Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina and Belizean Prime
Minister Manuel Esquivel to discuss practical measures to boost
mutual cooperation and regional integration.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the ROC will assist the Central American
countries in their economic development and will help promote
regional economic integration through trade, investment, technology
transfers, financial assistance and various economic cooperative
projects.
</P>
<P>
The ROC also promised to offer US$10 million in soft loans to
each of the five Central American countries to help their small- and
medium-sized enterprises expand their operations, develop new
products and explore new markets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a ministerial-level commission, to be composed of
economics ministers from the six countries, will be created to
promote trade, work out mid- and long-term joint investment projects
and conduct regular reviews of progress in various cooperative
programs. The commission will hold its first annual meeting in
Taipei next year.
 A vice-ministerial-level commission will also be established to
facilitate bilateral and multilateral technological cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Under the pact, the ROC will set up a Central American trade and
economic affairs office, and its semi-official China External Trade
Development Council will open a branch office in Honduras to promote
Taiwan's trade with and investment in the five Central American
countries.
</P>
<P>
The accord also stipulates that the signatories should strengthen
exchanges of business information and cooperate in developing
products of great export potential.
</P>
<P>
The six countries also vowed to promote cooperation in
environmental protection, the conservation of natural resources,
manpower resources development, industrial and agricultural
development and tourist exchanges.

ROC, 6 CENTRAL AMERICAN ALLIES VOW TO REINFORCE TIES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
San Salvador, Sept. 13 (CNA)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Republic of China and six of its
Central American allies signed a joint communique here on Saturday
pledging to boost mutual cooperation and regional economic and
political integration.
</P>
<P>
The joint communique was issued at the end of an unprecedented
summit meeting between the ROC and its six Central American allies,
which was held in connection with ROC President Lee Teng-hui's
current four-country Latin American tour.
</P>
<P>
The communique said the six Central American countries -- Belize,
Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua -- welcome
the ROC's decision to join the System of Central American
Integration, also known by the Spanish acronym SICA.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased to see progress in the formation of strategic
alliance between the ROC and Central American countries for common
interests," the communique said, adding the six countries will accept
the ROC's integration into SICA, a European Union-style regional
organization aimed at promoting a common market and common community.
</P>
<P>
The communique said President Lee and the top leaders of the six
Central American countries have exchanged views on international
affairs, particularly those related to Asia and Central America,
relations between the ROC and Central American countries and other
matters of mutual concern during the one-day summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
The six Central American countries reaffirmed their support for
the ROC's bid to rejoin the United Nations, the communique said,
adding that the six nations also back the ROC's stance on promoting
China's peaceful reunification under the principles of freedom and
democracy.
</P>
<P>
The communique further said the ROC and the six Central American
countries will jointly set up a US$300 million Central American
economic development fund to finance medium- and long-term investment
projects and infrastructure construction programs with a view to
promoting regional economic integration and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
According to a consensus reached at the summit meeting, the ROC
will contribute US$240 million in 12 installments to the proposed
development fund, while the Central American countries will jointly
contribute the remaining US$60 million.
</P>
<P>
The six Central American countries are also satisfied with the
recent inauguration of a Central American economic and trade office
in Taipei to boost trade, investment and tourist exchanges between
the ROC and Central American countries, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
The communique also hailed the signing of a US$50 million loan
agreement between Taiwan's International Commercial Bank of China and
the Central American Bank for Economic Integration to promote
development of small- and medium-sized enterprises in the region.
</P>
<P>
Following the issue of the joint communique, President Lee and
the six other summit meeting participants -- Salvadoran President
Armando Calderon Sol, Guatemalan President Alvaro Arzu, Costa Rican
President Jose Maria Figueres, Honduran President Carlos Roberto
Reina, Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman and Belizean Prime
Minister Manuel Esquivel -- gave a joint news conference.
</P>
<P>
Lee said on the occasion that the inclusion of the ROC into SICA
is a great event. "It's a landmark diplomatic achievement for our
country," he said. SICA not only promotes economic integration but
also facilitates cooperation in political and international affairs,
Lee noted. "It's a kind of strategic alliance to help cement our
relationships with Central American countries. This really marks a
breakthrough in our diplomatic work." Lee said the ROC will formally
apply to become a SICA member after its Legislative Yuan approves the
proposal. "We want to become an active and constructive member of
SICA to help promote Central American economic, political and social
integration," he said. SICA, headquartered in El Salvador, was
founded in the early 1990s. It currently has six full members --
Costa Rica, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala and Panama.
Belize is an observer.
</P>
<P>
In addition to attending the summit meeting, Lee also held
bilateral talks with top leaders of the six Central American
countries on Saturday. During their talks, the presidents of Costa
Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua as well as the
prime minister of Belize all assured Lee of their governments' firm
support for the ROC's UN bid. For his part, Lee said the ROC will
continue to assist the Central American countries in their national
development.
</P>
<P>
El Salvador is the third leg of Lee's four-country Latin American
tour. He already visited Panama and Honduras, and will travel to
Paraguay, the ROC's only ally in South America, for a three-day visit
on Sunday.

ROC TO OFFER US$50 MILLION IN SOFT LOAN TO PARAGUAY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Asuncion,   Sept.   13   (CNA)
(By Yen Ling-ju and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROC President Lee Teng-hui,
accompanied by a large entourage, is scheduled to arrive in Paraguay
Sunday for a three-day state visit.
</P>
<P>
Lee is the first ROC head of state to visit Paraguay. Paraguayan
President Juan Carlos Wasmosy will preside over an official welcoming
ceremony at the Silvio Petirosi Airport to greet Lee with full
military honors.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, the Republic of China and Paraguay are expected
to sign four cooperation agreements under which the ROC will offer a
total of US$50 million in low-interest loans to Paraguay for
agricultural development and construction of a bridge.
</P>
<P>
ROC Ambassador to Paraguay Liu Tin-tsu told CNA Saturday that
when Wasmosy visited Taipei in 1995, the ROC government had promised
to offer a US$30 million loan to help finance construction of a new
bridge between Asuncion and the Chaco region.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Liu said the ROC has also agreed to provide an
additional US$20 million loan for Paraguay to develop its
agriculture and related processing industries.
</P>
<P>
During Lee's stay, Lee said the ROC and Paraguay will also sign a
cooperation pact on manpower training. Under the accord, Paraguay
will send 30 promising youths to Taiwan annually for vocational
training.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Liu said, the two countries will sign a
long-talked-about aviation agreement to pave the way for direct
flight services between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Liu said Taiwan's EVA Airways currently operates direct flight
services between Taiwan and Panama. If such flights are extended to
Paraguay, the airline will see increases in its occupancy rate and
Taiwan tranvelers will see a six-hour cut in flight time. It takes
32 to 36 hours for a Taiwan passenger to reach Paraguay by air.
"Direct airlinks will help boost trade, tourist exchanges and
economic relations between Taiwan and Paraguay," Liu noted.
</P>
<P>
Liu also confirmed that the ROC agreed to donate US$20 million
to Paraguay four years ago for constructing a new parliamentary
building. The donation was given in four installments. Liu
presented a US$5 million check to the Paraguayan foreign minister on
Friday as the third installment. The remaining US$5 million will be
donated next year.
</P>
<P>
Liu said communist China has spared no effort to pressure
Paraguay, the ROC's only ally in South America, to switch its
diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing. For instance,
mainland China has purchased a large number of cotton from Paraguay
and promised to launch investment projects and set up export
processing zone in the country.
</P>
<P>
In the face of Beijing's mounting challenges, Liu said the ROC
government has been endeavoring to cement its ties with Paraguay
on a reciprocal basis.
</P>
<P>
Paraguay is the last leg of President's current four-country
Latin America tour aimed at shoring up the region's diplomatic
support for the ROC amid Beijing's intensified efforts to lure away
its diplomatic allies. Lee already visited Panama, Honduras and El
Salvador before coming to Paraguay. He will return to Taipei on
Sept. 19 via a transit stop in Hawaii.

BEIJING'S WTO ENTRY PROVING COMPLICATED: US EXPERT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva,  Sept. 13 (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The most important trade challenge facing
Europe and the United States is how to integrate the growing mainland
Chinese economy into the global marketplace, a US economist said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, the US-led negotiations with Beijing over the terms and
conditions of mainland China's admission to the Geneva-based World
Trade Organization (WTO) are not going well. The Clinton
administration has rejected Beijing's latest proposals, and demanded
greater openness in services and agriculture and faster timetable for
reducing trade barriers and subsidies, said Bruce Stokes, senior
fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, D.C..
</P>
<P>
In an article contributed to the Financial Times, Stokes said the
immediate outlook is for more argument. US and mainland Chinese
negotiators will meet again this month to stitch together a WTO deal
to be unveiled at the late-October summit between mainland Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and US President Bill Clinton. The betting in
Washington is that the negotiations will again come up short and that
no deal will be possible before the next Sino-American summit,
scheduled for early next year.
</P>
<P>
Whatever the hurdles, however, mainland China's admission to the
WTO is inevitable. So while the lower-level negotiators hammer out
the details, senior US and European trade officials should devise a
common strategy for the complications that will occur once Beijing
becomes a WTO member, Stokes advised.
</P>
<P>
Too much is at stake to delay, he said. A mishandling of mainland
China's role in the WTO could undermine many of the advantages Europe
and the United States hope to gain from the present accession talks.
Most important, the long-term credibility of the WTO could be hurt if
mainland China becomes a "problem" member, Stokes pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The stakes for mainland China are high: the WTO is asking it to
change the very structure of its economy. To meet the obligations of
membership, Beijing must wind down subsidies and protection for its
industries. But the mainland Chinese government is wary of triggering
unemployment by too rapid reform.
</P>
<P>
Facing the dilemma, whatever its intentions when it signs the
accession agreement, Beijing may find itself unable to meet all of
its WTO commitments in a timely fashion, he said.
</P>
<P>
In such circumstances, like any WTO member, the mainland Chinese
government can be hauled before a disputes resolution panel. But
given the problems with the mainland Chinese economy, the number of
these cases could soon get out of hand. No government of a major
country -- be it mainland China, Japan or the United States -- is
likely to continue to play a game it consistently loses, Stokes
cautioned.
</P>
<P>
What if Beijing refuses to comply with WTO decisions or threatens
to withdraw, he asked. If Brussels and Washington back off, the WTO
could lose international credibility and future leverage over
mainland China, he said.
</P>
<P>
To avoid such problems Brussels and Washington need to tell
Beijing now which of its WTO commitments are of greatest importance
to them, where failure to comply would trigger immediate WTO cases,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission and the Clinton administration also need
to find new means for dealing with mainland Chinese trade problems,
short of a wave of WTO cases that could alienate Beijing into
breaking away from the WTO, Stokes advised.
</P>
<P>
"In the end, it is not only the terms of China's accession to the
WTO but the nature of its participation that matters to Europe and
the United States," he said.

The leadership reshuffle currently under
way in the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) will be conducted with stability as its guiding principle,
which suggests that the scope of the reshuffle is not going to be as
wide as expected, sources close to the congress said recently.
</P>
<P>
With the exception of CPC Central Standing Committee member Liu
Huaqing, who, at 81 years of age, is almost certain to retire, the
other six committee members -- Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Li
Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji, and Hu Jintao -- will remain, while Ding Guangen
or Zhang Wannian may replace Liu.
</P>
<P>
This means that the "third generation" of collective leadership
will remain stable.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng's second term will be expire within the coming

committee unchanged, Li will probably assume the position of Chairman
of the National People's Congress or Vice President of mainland
China.

Centrazbat-97, a joint military exercise
which includes Turkey, the United States and Russia, along with three
Central Asian republics -- Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan,
will start on Monday on the plains of Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
According to defense experts in Ankara, the exercise, which will
conclude on Sept. 21, will be unique because it will be the first
maneuver in an area which was previously ruled for decades by the
former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the Turkish General Staff said that
Centrazbat-97 will focus on peacekeeping and humanitarian aid
maneuvers, in the spirit of NATO's Partnership for Peace concept.
</P>
<P>
According to military sources, around 1,500 troops will take part
in Centrazbat-97. The scenario for the exercise centers on an
imaginary border dispute between two fictitious countries, in which
American, Central Asian, Russian and Turkish forces are to monitor a
buffer zone during a UN-brokered truce.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the maneuver, a landing operation involving
Russian, Turkish and US airborne troops, will be carried out in
southern Kazakhstan between Sept. 15-17. The second phase will take
place at an Uzbekistan military training center near the capital,
Tashkent, on Sept. 18-21.

Denmark, Georgia, Latvia and Ukraine will also participate in the
second leg of the exercise, which will involve the overland transfer

ENGLISH SURVEY SEES KIDS START TELLING FIBS WHEN THEY TALK
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Canberra, Sept. 15 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Children can lie deliberately as soon as
they can talk and even before they grasp the idea of truth and
reality, according to a recent survey by English researchers.
</P>
<P>
They said the lies reported by parents take many forms and are
told for many reasons. They include hiding things, then denying
knowledge of their whereabouts and pretending not to know where
commonplace objects such as pajamas are kept.
</P>
<P>
Mass circulation newspaper The Australian on Monday published the
survey by Vasudevi Reddy and Paul Newton of Portsmouth University in
southern England, which has disproved the idea that children need to
possess a certain level of understanding before they can tell lies.
</P>
<P>
Between the age of three and four years, children learn that it
is possible for the mind to harbor false beliefs. Before that, they
tend to believe the mind automatically knows the truth, according to
the survey.
</P>
<P>
Previous theory holds that before this transition, children are
incapable of lies, but Reddy said a study of 24 children showed that
lying predates the transition and does not alter in form or content
as children pass through the transition.
</P>
<P>
"Children are lying, perhaps ineptly, as soon as they learn to
communicate," he said.
</P>
<P>
He relied on parents to report instances of lying because it was
extremely difficult to test children's ability to lie in laboratory
conditions.
</P>
<P>
A child's ability to recognize that beliefs can be false was
tested by putting them in a room and letting them watch an adult hide
an object. The adult then left and another adult came in and moved
the object.
</P>
<P>
When the first adult returned, he asked the child where the
object was and the answer revealed whether the child recognized it
could be somewhere other than where the adult believed it to be.
</P>
<P>
Reddy said children typically learn to pass such tests between
three and four years of age and earlier experiments have suggested
that before that age, they cannot lie. But in the home, very
different results were found. Lying was unaffected by the child's
ability to recognize false beliefs.

AUSTRALIAN TIGHTENS ENTRY RULES FOR NEW SKILLED IMMIGRANTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Canberra, Sept. 15 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Australia, anxious to curb the number of
new immigrants, is tightening entry rules for skilled immigrants and
only those who can have at least A$40,000 to provide for themselves
and their families will be qualified to come, the Department of
Immigration has said.
</P>
<P>
Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock said the new shakeup, to be
announced later this month, is designed to ease concerns that
untargeted skilled immigration is contributing to unemployment, which
is now hovering at 8.7 percent or nearly 800,000 jobless.
</P>
<P>
The department figures show that in 1995-96 under the independent
skilled category, Australia allowed entry to 625 engineers, 403
teachers, 476 accountants, 184 public relations officers, 558
computer professionals, 34 economists and 16 psychologists.
</P>
<P>
The new requirement that applicants must have sufficient means to
provide for themselves and their families has been made necessary by
welfare reforms which deny skilled immigrants access to social
security and other payments for their first two years of residence in
Australia.
</P>
<P>
Ruddock said the A$40,000 requirement is not unreasonable because
the money can help the new arrivals find jobs in Australia.
</P>
<P>
However, the requirement is expected to deter immigration from
less-developed countries where many applicants would find it
difficult to raise such an amount.
</P>
<P>
Under the present program, 14,700 places are reserved for
immigrants entering as independent skilled. Another 8,000 are set
aside for categories such as siblings, non-dependent children and
nephews and nieces who are also screened under a points test.
</P>
<P>
The Australian government has set the intake of immigration at
less than 70,000 for fiscal 1997-98, sharply down from nearly 100,000
in 1996-97.

heavy fines over publication of official secrets.
</P>
<P>
Nearly two years ago, the former Labor government under
then-Prime Minister Paul Keating reached an impasse with Australian
media executives over a proposal for a "voluntary" system backed by
A$1 million fines for a prohibited broadcast or publication of
defense or intelligence secrets.
</P>
<P>
The move followed revelations by disaffected former Australian
Secret Intelligence Service agents of spying operations and about the
bugging by Australian intelligence of foreign embassies, including
the Chinese and Japanese embassies in Canberra.
</P>
<P>
The media reports on the bugging operations were a major
embarrassment for Canberra.
</P>
<P>
Mass circulation newspaper The Australian on Monday quoted senior
sources as saying that Prime Minister John Howard will take a more
conciliatory line than the former government by first trying a
genuinely voluntary system to maximize the chances of winning media
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Ian McLachlan is expected to start consultations
with media executives on the new proposal of voluntary censorship.
</P>
<P>
The proposed censorship system -- known as the D-Notice -- would
cover two broad categories of national security information:
Australian Defense Force operations and capabilities and intelligence
collection, particularly where the life or freedom of someone is
placed in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
The prohibition on publication of military secrets would embrace
critical technical details of weapons systems, information on
stockpiles of ammunition, information on combat operations which
would help an adversary and information the Australian Defense Force
has about the military capabilities of other countries.
</P>
<P>
The sources reported the D-Notice would prevent disclosure of the
identities of spies and their sources, technical information about
Australia's intelligence-gathering capabilities, information about
specific intelligence objectives and details of how Australia
protects its own intelligence data.
</P>
<P>
The sources said a six-member cabinet security committee will try
to set up a committee of defense officials and media executives to
meet at least once each year to review the operation of the system.

TAIWAN PROFESSOR ARRESTED IN BEIJING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ROC government is concerned about the
recent arrest of a local university professor in Beijing, the
semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), which charts
Taiwan's policy toward mainland China, has authorized the SEF to
assist in handling the case.
</P>
<P>
The SEF said in a press release that Lin Cheng-cheng, a Japanese
literature professor at Tunghai University in central Taiwan,
traveled to Beijing together with one of his colleagues in mid-July
to attend a classmates reunion.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin's colleague, the professor was taken away by
mainland China public security agents while he was visiting a
friend's home. Lin's friend, identified only by his family name of
Wei, worked at a mainland Chinese government department in charge of
aerospace industry affairs and was also arrested.
</P>
<P>
Lin's colleague immediately returned to Taiwan and informed Lin's
family of the incident, whereupon Lin's wife contacted the SEF, which
sent a message to its mainland counterpart, the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), on July 24, asking it to
assist in tracking Lin's whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
After more than one month, ARATS finally informed the SEF on
Sept. 5 that Lin had been detained by a Beijing municipal agency for
questioning because he had violated mainland law, without explaining
his alleged offense.
</P>
<P>
The SEF expressed its hope in a press statement that mainland
China will handle the case in accordance with the law and based on
the principles of openness and fairness. It also urged mainland
authorities to inform Taiwan as soon as they make a decision on the
case.
</P>
<P>
The SEF and ARATS are semi-official intermediary bodies founded
by their respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in
the absence of official contacts.
</P>
<P>
SEF Deputy Secretary-General Lee Ching-ping said that unless
Lin's family makes a formal request, the SEF is not expected to take
any further action to push for Lin's early release.

<P>
Share prices on the Jakarta Stock
Exchange (JSX) are predicted to remain volatile this week as most
foreign investors are expected to stay away from the market.
</P>
<P>
Security analysts said over the weekend that the market outlook
will remain bearish due to a lack of fresh incentives.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Antara news agency reported that through the Jakarta
Stock Exchange, the government has issued a new regulation limiting
foreign ownership of bank shares to a maximum 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released on Friday, JSX said that the capital
market will soon implement the decree which the Ministry of Finance
issued last Sept. 3. It further said that foreign investors may own
100 percent of the issuers' shares in the primary and secondary
markets.
</P>
<P>
Stockbrokers said that the gloomy trading prospects on the local
stock exchange were in line with poor performances in other regional
markets.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the rupiah strengthened against the dollar, with spot
rupiah closing at 2,930/2,936 from an opening of 2,950/2,960.
</P>
<P>
Trading activities recovered early this week as investors reacted
to the government's decision.
</P>
<P>
However, share prices lost footing before the close of the week,
causing a 7.9 percent drop in the JSX composite index to 546.64.

<TEXT>
<P>
Paraguay, the Republic of China's only
ally in South America, rolled out the red carpet on Sunday to
welcome ROC President Lee Teng-hui as he arrived for a four-day state
visit.
</P>
<P>
Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy presided over an
official welcoming ceremony at the Silvio Petirosi Airport to greet
Lee, the first Asian head of state to visit Paraguay. Lee was
accorded full military honors, including a 21-gun salute.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 ROC expatriates, including some 100 from
neighboring Brazil, were on hand to greet Lee at the airport, adding
much fanfare and color to the occasion.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after his arrival, Lee was briefed by ROC Ambassador to
Paraguay Liu Tin-tsu on the general situation in Paraguay and the
latest developments in bilateral relationship.
</P>
<P>
Lee will meet with Wasmosy at the Paraguayan Presidential Office
Monday morning for talks on a range of matters of mutual concern.
Lee will then delivera speech at the Paraguayan Congress. In the
evening, Wasmosy will host a cocktail reception in honor of Lee.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, the ROC and Paraguay will sign four
cooperation agreements under which the ROC will offer a total of
US$50 million in low-interest loans to Paraguay for agricultural
development and construction of a new bridge linking its capital
city to the Chaco region.
</P>
<P>
Many senior Paraguayan officials and influential congressional
leaders, including Foreign Minister Ruben Melgarezo Lanzoni and
Senate Speaker Rodrigo Campos Cervera, expressed warm welcome to
Lee's visit, saying it will help boost bilateral cooperation and
contribute to Paraguay's development.
</P>
<P>
Paraguay is the last leg of President Lee's current 16-day Latin
America tour aimed at shoring up the region's diplomatic support for
the ROC amid Beijing's intensified efforts to lure away its
diplomatic allies. Lee already visited Panama, Honduras and El
Salvador. He is scheudled to return to Taipei on Sept. 19 via a

PREMIER SIEW VISITS SITE OF KAOHSIUNG GAS EXPLOSION
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Sept. 15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Vincent Siew went to the southern
Taiwan port city of Kaohsiung on Monday to visit the site of a
Saturday-morning gas explosion which claimed the lives of four people
and injured more than 20, some of whom are reported to be in critical
condition with extensive burns.
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred in the Chienchen district of the city
after liquefied petroleum gas leaked from a stretch of underground
pipe belonging to the state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) while
workers contracted by the company were attempting to reroute the pipe
to make way for a road-widening project.
</P>
<P>
Siew, accompanied by Kaohsiung City Mayor Wu Den-yih and CPC
Chairman Lee Shu-chiou, first listened to a briefing by Chen
Pao-lang, manager of CPC's Kaohsiung refinery plant.
</P>
<P>
In his briefing, Chen said that engineers and firefighters were
on hand as work on the pipe proceeded and that the explosion was
probably caused by the engines of motorcyclists who disregarded a
safety cordon and entered the area where the work was being carried
out.
</P>
<P>
A solemn-faced Siew offered his apology to the public for the
tragic accident and also asked Lee to determine the cause of the
explosion as quickly as possible and ascertain those responsible.
</P>
<P>
He asked the CPC to learn from other nations about rescue
operations following major industrial disasters and instructed the
company to step up safety monitoring procedures in order to try to
salvage the company image, which has been severely undermined by 12
major accidents in the last 14 months.
</P>
<P>
Siew then inspected the site of explosion before visiting the
victims at local hospitals, where he asked about the assistance they
are receiving.

BEIJING URGED TO DEAL PRAGMATICALLY WITH TAIPEI

<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Chang King-yuh on Sunday urged Beijing to handle cross-strait ties in
a practical manner and warned it not to seek to impose the "one
country, two systems" scheme on Taiwan, which he said will hinder
China's unification.
</P>
<P>
Chang said that unlike Hong Kong, the future of cross-strait
relations depends on whether mainland China will treat Taiwan on an
equal footing and resume cross-strait talks based on respect for the
fact that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait remain divided and under
separate rule.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Taiwan's case is totally different from that of
Hong Kong and that it will never accept Beijing's "one country, two
systems" scheme imposed on Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Chang made the remarks while delivering a speech on Taiwan-Hong
Kong-mainland China ties at a conference sponsored by Chinese
academics from the eastern side of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Although Hong Kong has remained stable since its return to
mainland China rule on July 1, Chang said Hong Kong's future remains
to be seen, because of a number of factors.
</P>
<P>
Chang told the more-than 200 attendees that the Republic of China
government hopes that Hong Kong will remain stable and prosperous and
will continue to play the role of a conduit for cross-strait
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that Beijing should rethink its claim
that the "one country, two systems" formula implemented in Hong Kong
paves the way for Taiwan's unification with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
China's unification will be hard to achieve if Beijing ignores
Taiwan's status as a sovereign state, he warned, adding that the ROC
government will never yield to Beijing's pressure.
</P>
<P>
He called on Beijing to reopen cross-strait talks without
preconditions in order to create a "win-win-win" situation for the
two sides and Hong Kong, saying that only mutually beneficial
negotiations will help lead to China's unification.

THE FORGOTTEN BILLION IN ASIA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva,  Sept.  14 (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Poverty is declining faster in Asia than
anywhere else, the World Bank proclaims in a new report -- but there
are still nearly one billion Asians below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
Isn't there some slight contradiction here? In fact, it is a
massive one which reflects the real world of modern development in
which economic growth seems to widen rather than lessen the gap
between rich and poor, Britain's Guardian newspaper said in a Sunday
editorial.
</P>
<P>
Large parts of Asia have been praised in glowing terms as models
for development: the famous "little tigers" have been joined by
communist China and to some extent, India, as exemplars for the West.
</P>
<P>
Yet 35 percent of all Indians subsist on less than the equivalent
of one US dollar a day, and 20 percent do so across East Asia -- in
communist China, the percentage is one-third.
</P>
<P>
The crude totals are staggering: over half a billion South Asians
and more than 450 million East Asians live below this poverty line.
The figures are much worse when disaggregated: inland communist
China, northeastern Thailand and the eastern islands of Indonesia lag
far behind; India's rural and urban poor form the majority in some
states and cities.
</P>
<P>
As a separate report on India issued recently by the bank
remarks, this burden of poverty imposes an "oppressive weight" upon
the country, the Guardian pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has come a long way in recent years towards
acknowledging that economic growth is not the sole measurement of
human progress and that reducing poverty cannot be left to the
trickle-down of newly generated wealth to the poorer sectors of
society.
</P>
<P>
Even the statistics of poverty have been revised upwards -- in
communist China from 100 million to more than 300 million (India has
almost doubled its estimate of those below the line).
</P>
<P>
In its report on poverty reduction earlier this year, the Bank
recognized that other measures will be required.
</P>
<P>
First, "prevailing conditions must enable the poor to participate
in economic growth." and second, it is essential to ensure that "the
benefits of growth favor the poor disproportionately."
</P>
<P>
This is fine in theory, but just how can the new Asia elites be
persuaded to apply this principle of reverse discrimination to the
creation of wealth?
</P>
<P>
Presenting the two reports, the World Bank's managing director
has placed the need for investment in "human capital," such as health
and education, on the same level with sound monetary policy and
industrial investment.
</P>
<P>
This is a healthy reversion to earlier developmental thinking
which attached more importance to non-growth factors. But it remains
to be shown just how the prevailing model of a globalized market will
deliver the goods to Asia's poor and backward areas while the
surpluses which it generates are all-too-likely to be siphoned off by
corrupt politicians and the new middle classes.
</P>
<P>
Nor is there any guarantee that the present high growth rates
will last. This is a problem, like the poor themselves, which will
not disappear: the great rethink must go further, the Guardian said.

Mainland China's President Jiang Zemin's

The move is certain to be beneficial to the construction of
socialist modernization which focuses on economics, they added.

ARMED FORCES CUTS INCREASE IMPORTANCE OF ARMED POLICE IN MAINLAND CHINA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  15  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After reducing its armed forces by one
million in the 1980s, Beijing is set to cut military personnel by
another half-million over the next three years, thus raising the
importance and role of the People's Armed Police (PAP) in mainland
China.
</P>
<P>
The trend indicates that the role of the People's Liberation Army
(PLA) in the control of Mainland China's domestic security is fading
and will soon be taken over by the PAP.
</P>
<P>
The PAP is under of the control of the Central Military
Commission and in the political arena, the leadership of the PAP has
often been merged with the PLA leadership. However, the current 15th
National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) for the first
time sees the PAP with only 37 congress representatives, compared
with the 269 PLA representatives.
</P>
<P>
This is being seen as a message of great significance. That fact
that the PAP and the PLA are apparently now being organized
separately but in parallel at the ongoing congress shows clear
political intention.
</P>
<P>
Although this intention to separate the police from the armed
services is being viewed as a blessing, the raising of the political
role of the police is nevertheless not a regular occurrence and some
analysts view the move as potentially harmful to Beijing's attempts
to dilute the role of the military in mainland China's political
affairs.

<P>
The Chinese Moon Festival, one of the
three most important festivals in Taiwan, begins Monday and will
continue through Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A variety of entertainment and traditional activities have been
arranged by local governments, cultural centers and museums around
the island.
</P>
<P>
The National Museum of Natural Science has scheduled a series of
moon-related activities beginning at 9:00 a.m. on Tuesday, including
tours of its astronomy and meteorology exhibits, while later during
the evening, museum staff will be on hand at the entrance to the
Chinese Science Hall to give instructions on how to recognize the
planets.
</P>
<P>
Marking this year's moon festival as extra-special, a lunar
eclipse is expected to occur early on Wednesday morning and will be
visible between 1:08 a.m. and 4:25 a.m., the Central Weather Bureau
indicated on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The phenomenon will be the third to occur during the festival in
the past 29 years, the last two occurring in 1968 and 1978.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei Astronomical Museum encouraged the public not to miss
the chance of viewing the eclipse and advised photographers to
prepare their telephoto lenses for shots of the eclipse.
</P>
<P>
In related news, the Taipei City Government will hold an open-air
concert on the night of the festival in the city's newest park, which
stretches for several kilometers along the banks of the Keelung
River.
</P>
<P>
The concert will begin at 7:30 p.m. and will feature performances
by local and foreign musicians, including a jazz band from Finland, a
folk band from Bolivia and a team of musicians from Scotland, as well
as local aboriginal singing and dancing groups.
</P>
<P>
Besides the musical entertainment, the city government has also
prepared other activities such as an open-air traditional "mosquito"
movie theater, featuring mandarin and local dialect movies, public
poem readings and a chance to view the moon and the eclipse through a
powerful telescope.
</P>
<P>
The city government will run free shuttle buses service to
transport people to the various scenic spots and highlights and
activities occurring at various different locations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several environmental groups, criticizing the island's
chronic garbage problem, are urging the public to make sure they
enjoy a clean and garbage-free moon festival and to take home their
trash or dispose of it properly.

cigarettes to youngsters without proof of age.
</P>
<P>
Chan pointed out clearly that DOH has limited human resources to
monitor the implementation of the regulations and that to give teeth
to the regulations concerning the prevention of damage by cigarettes,
it will have to rely on the consciences of the enterprises involved,
campaigns launched by non-profit organizations and public awareness
of the damage caused by cigarette-smoking.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that middle high school students accounted for
16.2 percent of cigarette smokers in Taiwan in 1994, underscoring
the importance of aiming the campaign especially towards minors.
</P>
<P>
He said that 90 percent of adult cigarette smokers began to smoke
before the age of 19 and that those who do not smoke before the age
of 18 have only a 10 percent chance of becoming smokers in the
future.
</P>
<P>
Yeh also said that 20 percent of health insurance expenses are
related to the ill-effects of smoking.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Chen Chi-mai estimated that cigarette-smoking incurs
NT$50 billion in economic losses to Taiwan annually, while another
legislator, Hsieh Chin-chung, said he hopes that 70,000 other grocery
stores in Taiwan will follow the lead of the big franchises and stop
selling cigarettes to minors.

FORUM HELD IN SYDNEY TO EDUCATE CHINESE IN DEALING WITH RACISM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Canberra,  Sept.  15  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Overseas Chinese in New South Wales
(NSW) on Sunday received lessons on how to deal with racism, which is
growing as a result of the establishment of the One Nation Party set
up by Independent Member of Parliament Pauline Hanson.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese Australians have suffered or are suffering violence
and verbal threats and other forms of harassment in the state and the
forum offered some methods of dealing with the problem.
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented move was initiated by Chinese community leaders
in NSW with the backing of the NSW Ethnic Communities Council and
might be copied by other ethnic groups, a spokesman for the
organizing committee said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the distress and fear which pervades many ethnic
communities, some hope was evident that racism can be successfully
overcome.
</P>
<P>
Photographs of 10,000 "protesters against racism" were assembled
in Sydney, forming an arresting photo-petition. The faces of the
thousands of protesters mounted on meter-wide boards were accepted by
Governor General Sir William Deane at the forum.
</P>
<P>
"It is a gesture by thousands and thousands of ordinary
Australians," Sir William said. "It demonstrates national opposition
to racism in all of its ugly forms," he added.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 Australians have so far joined an anti-racism
campaign which began four months ago, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The essence of our multiculturalism is the mutual respect and
tolerance which binds us all together as one nation and one people,"
Sir William said.
</P>
<P>
The NSW Ethnic Community Council chairman said: "The message we
want to put across to people from ethnic groups is that they must
avoid violent situations at all costs. There is an aspect of personal
safety involved. When you are dealing with people who are taunting
you, they only need half a chance to beat you up."
</P>
<P>
More than 400,000 Chinese Australians now live in Australia. They
come mainly from Southeast Asia, mainland China, Hong Kong and
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese leaders in NSW and other states in Australia want to
see Pauline Hanson defeated in the next election, possibly to be held
sometime next year, because of her anti-Asian immigration stance.

MOVES TO CURB MAD COW DISEASE MAY CAUSE DRUG SHORTAGES: WTO
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva,  Sept. 15 (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
European Union (EU) scientists are locked
in discussions on ways to prevent a potential shortage of vital
medicines caused by new safety rules designed to curb the spread of
mad cow disease, according to reports of the Geneva-based World Trade
Organization (WTO) Monday.
</P>
<P>
The United States has warned that the rules -- which ban
materials at high risk of carrying mad cow disease, also known as
BSE, from being used "for any purpose" within the EU -- could block
US$4.5 billion of imported US pharmaceuticals, along with some
EU-made products, leading to shortages, the WTO report said.
</P>
<P>
Most pharmaceuticals and many cosmetics products contain
derivatives of tallow, usually made by boiling down whole animal
carcasses -- including materials that will be banned by EU rules from
next January.
</P>
<P>
The United States -- which says it is BSE-free and should be
exempted from the rules adopted by the European Commission in July --
has several times threatened to refer the case to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
The EU's scientific steering committee on BSE, which is
coordinating Brussels' response to the mad cow crisis, was holding
discussions on whether to endorse the opinion of another EU
scientific committee that the cosmetics made with tallow derivatives
are safe.
</P>
<P>
If that opinion is endorsed, the principle could be extended to
pharmaceuticals made with the same derivatives -- provided they were
heat-treated according to three accepted methods.
</P>
<P>
But US and European pharmaceutical companies warn that such a
ruling would not entirely avert potential shortages of medicines.
While more than 80 percent of all pharmaceutical products contain
derivatives of tallow, 50-80 percent of capsules contain derivatives
of gelatin -- also made from animal carcasses.
</P>
<P>
Some pharmaceuticals and biotechnology products are also made
using materials such as the brain and spinal cord, which are banned
from use by the EU rules.
</P>
<P>
Exports of all British beef and beef products were banned last
year after the British government's announcement of a probable link
between mad cow disease and fatal human brain disease.

AUSTRALIA TO ASK MEDIA TO CENSOR STATE SECRETS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Canberra,  Sept.  15 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Australian government is trying to
protect national defense and intelligence secrets by asking media to
conduct voluntary censorship instead of punishing them with heavy
fines over publication of official secrets.
</P>
<P>
Nearly two years ago, the former Labor government under then
Prime Minister Paul Keating reached an impasse with Australian media
executives over a proposal for a "voluntary" system backed by A$1
million (US$725 million) in fines for a prohibited broadcast or
publication of defense and intelligence secrets.
</P>
<P>
The move followed revelations by disaffected former Australian
Secret Intelligence Service agents of spying operations and about the
bugging by Australian intelligence of foreign embassies in Canberra,
including those of mainland China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The media reports on the bugging operations caused an
embarrassment for Canberra.
</P>
<P>
The mass circulation newspaper The Australian on Monday quoted
senior sources as saying that Prime Minister John Howard would take a
more conciliatory line than the former government by first trying a
genuinely voluntary system to maximize the chances of winning media
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Ian McLachlan is expected to start consultations
with media executives on the new proposal of voluntary censorship on
publication or broadcast of top secrets.
</P>
<P>
The proposed censorship system -- known as D-Notice -- would
cover two broad categories of national security information:
Australian Defense Force operations and capabilities and intelligence
collection, particularly where the life or freedom of someone is
placed in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
The prohibition on military secrets would embrace critical
technical details of weapons systems, information on stockpiles of
ammunition such as the number of Harpoon missiles, information on
combat operations that would help an adversary and information the
Australian Defense Force has about the military capabilities of other
countries.
</P>
<P>
The sources reported the D-Notice would prevent disclosure of the
identities of spies and their sources, technical information about
Australia's intelligence gathering capabilities, information about
specific intelligence objectives and details of how Australia
protects its own intelligence data.
</P>
<P>
The sources said a six-member Cabinet security committee will try
to set up a committee of defense officials and media executives so
that they could meet at least once a year to review the operations of
the system.

A brand-new landmark will be born in the
metropolis in the near future, replacing the Shin-Kong Building near
the Taipei Railway Station as the capital's tallest building.
</P>
<P>
At 422 meters, the 88-story "Taipei International Financial
Building" will be taller than Manhattan's Empire State Building and
World Trade Center in New York City once it is completed.
</P>

Lin Hung-ming, vice chairman of the Hung Kuo Group, designer of
the new building, said that the skyscraper was originally designed to
have 66 floors, with a stock exchange to be located in an adjoining
building.
</P>
<P>
But when exchange officials insisted that the bourse be located
in the main building, the developer decided to revise the design, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Since winning the bid for the project in July, the China
Development Corp. has been aggressively preparing the formation of a
new corporation that will be responsible for the construction of the
financial building.
</P>
<P>
China Development will hold 19 percent of the corporation; China
United Trust and Investment Corp. will take 28.5 percent; Chieh Ho 
Construction Corp., 14.25 percent; the Taiwan Stock Exchange, 5
percent; and seven other financial institutions will hold the
remainder.

</P>
<P>
Sun Moon Lake is one of Taiwan's top tourist attractions and is
especially popular with honeymooners.

were reported in the event, adding that after the drowning death of a
69-year-old participant during last year's cross-lake swim, they took
additional measures to ensure the safety of the swimmers.
</P>
<P>
The race across the 3,000 meter-wide lake was swum in staggered
starts of groups of 50 people, with handicapped people the first in
the water at 8:30 a.m.. The oldest swimmer was 82-year-old Ding
Lin-han from Taipei, while the fastest swimmer was a woman from New
Zealand, who used less than 40 minutes to complete the race at 9:31
a.m..
</P>
<P>
Most of the participants swam leisurely, with many of them
singing or even playing the harmonica as they made their way across
the lake. Many people swam with family members.
</P>
<P>
The organizers said that when the annual event was first held in
1984, 580 people took part. They also said they hope to hold the
cross-lake swim every season of the year in the future.

<P>
Zhao Ziyang, former general secretary
of the Communist Party of China (CPC), sent an open letter to the
presidium of the CPC's 15th National Congress urging a review of the
1989 student-led demonstrations in Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
Indicted for "supporting upheaval" and "splitting the Party" over
the demonstrations, which ended in a bloody crackdown June 4, 1989,
Zhao was forced to step down from his position and has been living
under house arrest in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Zhao sent the letter Sept. 12, the day the party congress opened.
This is the first time he has sent an open letter to a CPC national
congress.
</P>
<P>
According to the "Apple Daily", the letter was sent through a
special channel and has not been shown to all of the congress
delegates but only to the seven members of the Standing Committee of
the Political Bureau and some of the senior members of the old guard.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Zhao argued that labeling the student
demonstration in Tiananmen Square "counterrevolutionary upheaval" is
not tenable and that what he sought in 1989 was "on the track of
democracy and the legal system" to solve the issue.
</P>
<P>
He said his letter was not aimed at placing blame on individuals
but at making the CPC "learn a lesson from the past." By doing so,
Zhao emphasized, the CPC would not only resolve the problem and keep
the domestic situation stable but also secure a more favorable
environment for mainland China's reform policies.

CENTRAL AMERICA SUITED FOR TAIWAN INVESTORS: CNFI

<TEXT>
<P>
The Chinese National Federation of
Industries (CNFI) announced on Monday that it will sponsor a seminar
to introduce the investment climate in Central America and study the
feasibility of setting up a holding company to explore the Central
American market.
</P>
<P>
The CNFI said it plans to invite Council for Economic Planning
and Development Chairman P.K. Chiang, Central Bank of China Governor
Y.D. Sheu and Economic Affairs Minister Wang Chih-kang to attend the
seminar and jointly assess the ways of venturing into the region.
</P>
<P>
The CNFI, which dispatched a 50-member delegation to seek trade
and investment opportunities with Latin American countries in line
with President Lee Teng-hui's current four-nation Latin American
tour, said Central America is suited for investment from Taiwan
businesses. The CNFI delegation returned here earlier on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the CNFI's view, countries in Central America are promising
markets worthy of exploration by Taiwan businesses because of
affordable land, a cheaper labor force and a large population of
consumers.
</P>
<P>
Compared with mainland China and Southeast Asia, the region's
proximity to the United States -- Taiwan's largest export market --
provides another major fillip for Taiwan investors, especially the
food processing and textile sectors, it pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chiang, who also returned to Taiwan on Monday from
Paraguay, revealed that he will depart for New York on Sept. 23 to
take part in a meeting there of the System of Central American
Integration, known by its Spanish acronym as SICA, a local newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chiang, who also accompanied Lee on his tour of four Latin
American nations, said the local business community now has greater
interest in investing in Central America since gaining a better
understanding of the investment climate there.
</P>
<P>
Although President Lee signed various trade and commerce
cooperation agreements with the host countries during his journey to
Panama, El Salvador, Honduras and Paraguay, Chiang said the Republic
of China government wishes to ink a free trade zone agreement with
those countries in the long run with the hope of eventually becoming
a member of the region's economic system.

BEIJING URGED TO TAKE BACK ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS SOON

<TEXT>
<P>
With more than 500 illegal mainland
immigrants still in Taiwan, an official of the cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) expressed the hope that both sides of the
Taiwan Strait can resume talks soon to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
Wu An-chia, MAC vice chairman, made the remarks when he visited
a detention center for illegal mainland immigrants in
Hsinchu, northern Taiwan on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The center set up phones so the detainees could call their
families in the mainland free of charge to ease their homesickness on
the eve of the mid-autumn Moon Festival, which falls on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
To avoid psychological problems resulting from long detention, Wu
urged a resumption of cross-strait talks as soon as possible to
discuss efficient ways to deter illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
He also urged mainland China to pick up the illegal mainland
immigrants as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement Taiwan's Red Cross Society and its mainland
counterpart signed in Kinmen in September 1990, Taiwan is responsible
for sending illegal immigrants to Kinmen and Matsu while mainland
China is to send ships to the two Taiwan outpost islands to pick them
up.
</P>
<P>
But mainland Chinese representatives, saying the transport ships
have broken down, have not come to pick up mainland nationals in
months.
</P>
<P>
As the Kinmen agreement does not fully cover repatriation
proceedings and the definition of criminal convicts or suspects, Wu
said that when cross-strait talks resume, he hopes both sides can
reach a more detailed agreement to ensure safe, swift and efficient
repatriation of criminal convicts and suspects to improve social
order.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by the Bureau of Entry and Exit,
between Jan. 1, 1989 and Aug. 31, 1997 the government detained 35,300
illegal mainland immigrants and has so far repatriated 34,641 of
them. Over 500 illegal mainland immigrants are still being held in
the Hsinchu, Matsu and Ilan detention centers. Among them, 123 have
stayed for over six months.

promoting relations and cooperation between the Republic of China and
Paraguay based on past achievements.
</P>
<P>
During their hour-long talks, the two presidents agreed that the
Southern Common Market, which groups Paraguay, Uruguay, Argentina and
Brazil, commands enormous market potential and deserves exploration.
</P>
<P>
Lee told Wasmosy that the Republic of China will use Paraguay as
a bridgehead to tap the immense Southern Common Market, the world's
fourth largest trade bloc.
</P>
<P>
Wasmosy said he hopes the ROC will assist his country in
agricultural development, including the cultivation of tropical
fruits and construction of irrigation systems.
</P>
<P>
In response, Lee promised to send a delegation of agricultural
experts and engineers to Paraguay to assist in constructing dams and
irrigation systems and in establishing plantations of high
value-added crops.
</P>
<P>
Lee went on to say that his current four-day state visit to
Paraguay is of great significance, adding he hopes it will help
further strengthen bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The ROC head of state also said he is impressed by progress in
various facets of Paraguayan society over the past 12 years. Lee last
visited Paraguay in 1985 in his capacity as ROC vice president.
</P>
<P>
Following his meeting with Wasmosy, Lee delivered a speech at the
Paraguayan Congress appealing for world recognition of the ROC's
legitimate right to take part in major international organizations
and activities.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the communist regime in Beijing can by no means
represent the 21 million residents of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and
Matsu, which are under the ROC's full jurisdiction. In the face of
mainland China's intensified diplomatic offensive against the ROC,
Lee said his government will not be daunted by such challenges and
will continue to defend the nation's dignity and seek a greater role
in the international arena.
</P>
<P>
Despite Beijing's reluctance to face up to the reality that the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait are currently ruled by two separate
governments and its resistance to treating Taiwan as an equal
political entity, Lee said the ROC government and people will never
stop their pursuit of China's peaceful reunification under the
principles of freedom, democracy and prosperity. "We believe that our
peaceful and rational stance will eventually win wide recognition in
the international community," he said.
</P>
<P>
Touching on ROC-Paraguayan relations, Lee said he appreciates the
firm support Paraguay has extended to the ROC over past years. "I'm
convinced that our friendship and cooperation will become even closer
in the future through increased political, economic and cultural
exchanges."
</P>
<P>
Lee's speech drew a warm response from Paraguayan lawmakers.
Nearly all of the 125 members of the Paraguayan Congress turned out
to listen to Lee's address.
</P>
<P>
Senate Speaker Rodrigo Campos Cervera said Lee's speech clearly
explains the ROC's stance on relations with mainland China, its
economic and political reforms, as well as its determination to
contribute to world peace and prosperity. "I'm moved by your
country's determination and courage," he told CNA. Campos also
expressed his gratitude for the ROC's donation of US$20 million for
the construction of Paraguay's new congressional building.
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, Lee attended a luncheon hosted in his honor by
major overseas Chinese organizations here. Speaking on the occasion,
Lee said the ROC's recent constitutional amendments have laid a solid
foundation for Taiwan's sustained development over the next 30 to 40
years.
</P>
<P>
In the evening, Lee attended a cocktail reception hosted by
Paraguayan President Wasmosy in his honor. During the gala party,
Wasmosy showed to Lee a model of a new bridge to be built with a
US$30 million loan from the ROC. The new bridge will connect Asuncion
and a new city in the Chaco region. Taiwan's BES Engineering Corp.
has drawn a blueprint for the new city.
</P>
<P>
Lee is scheduled to sign a joint communique with Wasmosy on
Tuesday. The two countries will also sign agreements on aviation,
trade, manpower training and loans before Lee concludes his four-day
visit here on Wednesday.

OVERWEIGHT WOMEN SAID ABLE TO BECOME PREGNANT BY SHEDDING KILOS

<TEXT>
<P>
Overweight women with fertility problems
can dramatically improve their chances of becoming pregnant by
shedding up to 10 kilos, according to a new survey in Australia.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows fat is not fertile, according to pregnancy
expert Dr. Anne Clark.
</P>
<P>
She told reporters that her findings could provide new hope to
couples with fertility problems.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 percent of the Australian women who took part in the
pilot program conceived after losing up to 10 kilograms, said Clark,
medical director of the fertility clinic at Hurstville Community
Hospital in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"Before losing weight, these women had a zero to 3 percent
pregnancy rate, despite several assisted reproduction treatments.
They also had a 75 percent miscarriage rate," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Their weight loss was sufficient to allow them to ovulate
spontaneously, or respond to fertility treatment programs," she
added.
</P>
<P>
Clark said obese women who lose even a small amount of weight
have significantly improved ovulation, pregnancy rates and successful
conceptions.
</P>
<P>
One in six Australian couples have fertility problems, with 40
percent of these cases caused because the woman cannot conceive, she
said.

<P>
Bank Indonesia, the central bank, cut
rates again Monday on its short-term papers (SBIs) by 100 and 200
basis points in an effort to lower overall banking interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia's managing director Paul Soetopo Tjokro-negoro
said here Monday the central bank would continue to gradually cut SBI
rates.
</P>
<P>
"The interest rate cut was made to meet public demand. As the
public want us to lower SBI rates, we'll do so," he was quoted by the
Jakarta Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
The central bank on Monday cut interest rates for one-month SBIs
by one percentage point to 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the bank kept overnight SBI rates at 15 percent, two to
six-day SBIs at 16 percent, six-month at 12.125 and one year at 12.75
percent.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia has cut SBI rates three times this month, bringing
down one-month SBI rates from 30 percent to 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers and stockbrokers said the rate cuts give another
positive signal to markets, with the rupiah stabilizing and stock
prices gaining ground.
</P>
<P>
They said the rate cuts had been widely anticipated and factored
in, providing little stimulation to the market.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah held on well despite the rate cuts, creeping lower to
2,940-2,945 against the US dollar, from 2,935 before the cut in thin
trading.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, share prices on the Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX)
gained 0.8 percent on the back of gains in selected stocks led by
banks following a further rate cut, stockbrokers said.
</P>
<P>
The JSX composite index closed up 4.124 points to 550.761, with a
total turnover of 253.22 million shares worth Rp 319.25 billion

<TEXT>
<P>
Australia's Foreign Minister Alexander
Downer has reassured Asia that his country is ready to offer
financial help if the regional currencies come under further attack.
</P>
<P>
Australia's pledge of US$1 billion to help Thailand weather its
currency crisis has "done a good deal to rebuild international
confidence in the Thai economy," Downer said in a speech to the
Australia-Thailand Business Council in Perth Monday.
</P>
<P>
"If we were called in a hypothetical situation to provide support
for other countries in the region or additional support for Thailand
or whatever it may be, we would obviously look at that," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But I don't think it is going to come to that," he added.
</P>
<P>
Downer expressed confidence in the long-term future of Southeast
Asian economies despite the recent currency crisis that has forced
the international community to bankroll Thailand with a US$16 billion
rescue package.
</P>
<P>
He said helping other Asian countries financially is in
Australia's best interest.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of our future is tied up in this (Asian) region," an
official of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said.
</P>
<P>
Australia's exports to Asia account for about 60 percent of its
total export volume.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia
had similar currency crises, all of which affected Australia's
exports to those countries, the official said.

OVER 7 % GROWTH RATE BETWEEN AUGUST AND DECEMBER TARGETED
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Sept.  16  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
hopes that Taiwan's export growth will reach over 7 percent monthly
between August and December, Chang Chang-pang, vice economic affairs
minister, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chang made the remarks when he was outlining the major tasks his
ministry wants to complete before the end of this year, including
having the government working hand in hand with the private sector to
promote exports.
</P>
<P>
Chang said that foreign trade has been the prime mover of
Taiwan's economy, accounting for over 70 percent of its economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Noting that with the upgrading of Taiwan's industry and the image
of its products, as well as the world's increased trade volume, Chang
said there is much room for the island's foreign trade to expand and
that the government working with the private sector to promote trade
will be a top priority.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes the growth rate for the whole of the year
will hit 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Chang said that the ministry has worked out a strategy to promote
exports based on the competitive edge of Taiwan products and the
characteristics of individual regions.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will also join forces with related industrial and
commercial groups to promote trade with the United States, Japan,
Europe, Southeast Asia and other emerging markets that show
potential, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chang said specifically that the semi-official China External
Trade Development Council (CETRA) will set up an office in Japan to
help promote Taiwan products there with the aim of cutting the
island's large trade deficit with that country.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will also forge strategic alliances to promote its
world parts and components purchase center project in areas such as
Silicon Valley in California to introduce new technology to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ministry will promote bilateral trade and
investment to expand the market share Taiwan products enjoy in
Europe, cement trade relations with Southeast Asian countries and set
up footholds in the emerging markets of East European countries, he
said.

Youths in Taiwan don't trust Beijing's
"one country, two systems" formula and believe mainland China would
invade if Taiwan declared independence, BusinessWeek magazine said in
its Sept. 15 issue.
</P>
<P>
The approach to China's reunification is among the weighty
matters that young people in Taiwan must consider, BusinessWeek said
in a special report, titled "Prosperity is a Double-edged Sword."
"Quite a few young faces were among the 60,000 who attended a summer
rally to make the point that Taiwan won't go the way of Hong Kong,"
the report noted.
</P>
<P>
Since martial law was lifted a decade ago and as families have
grown richer, kids in Taiwan have started to behave like those in
other industrialized societies, said the weekly magazine. "They are
more assertive and more willing to experiment," it quoted Wu
Jing-jyi, executive director of the Fulbright Foundation's Taiwan
office, as saying. Meanwhile, according to James Hsueh, a sociologist
at National Taiwan University, the next generation will be more
rational about the issue of national reunification.
</P>
<P>
The darker view among some teachers is that empty materialism has
replaced the nationalism of martial-law days, BusinessWeek noted.
</P>
<P>
In addition to a potential crisis with mainland China, it pointed
out, other pressures exist, especially those from a relentless exam
system. Meanwhile, teen pregnancy, gang activity and violence are on
the rise, it added. "Many youngsters are not prepared to enjoy this
sudden freedom," it said.
</P>
<P>
The changes are fueling a powerful consumer market, BusinessWeek
said. Figures show that people from ages 20 to 30 make up 17 percent
of Taiwan's population but account for 40 percent of total
consumption, it added.
</P>
<P>
The youth of Taiwan are much more freewheeling than their
mainland counterparts but still study hard, BusinessWeek noted.
Though apolitical, they are very anxious about the island's future,
it said.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan's rapid shift to affluence and its political freedom are
plainly challenges to young people trying to make sense of the
times," it concluded.

LOCAL PRESS COMMENT ON LEGISLATORS' DEMAND FOR ACCOUNT OF PRESIDENT'S TRIP
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The following are excerpts from an
editorial from Tuesday's edition of local English-daily the China
News.
</P>
<P>
Public Deserves to Know the Details
</P>
<P>
With four days still remaining of President Lee Teng-hui's trip
to Central and South America, opposition lawmakers are already
issuing demands that Lee appear in the legislature to give a full
report on the details of his state visits.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers are concerned that the president has made promises that
are tantamount to the signing of a treaty (a very expensive treaty),
which falls under the power of the legislature to approve.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic treaties notwithstanding, the legislature is in no
real position to demand any such explanations from the president. The
head of state is under no legal obligation whatsoever to explain his
actions to lawmakers (the constitution makes President Lee
responsible solely to the National Assembly). And if the legislature
doesn't approve of slush funds, then it should stop writing blank
checks to the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Yes, the president should offer details of his trip, and of any
diplomatic successes, and of the money spent. But the legislature
isn't necessarily the place to do so.
</P>
<P>
As president and leader of the Taiwan people, Lee should not feel
duty-bound but rather honored to explain his policies and promises to
the people he represents (and who voted for him).
</P>
<P>
Following what has been a successful, high-profile foreign
excursion, Lee is not so much being asked to account for his actions
as simply explain what it all means. And it is not necessary for the
legislature to play a role in this.

President Lee Teng-hui is scheduled to
conclude his Latin American trip late Sept. 17, Taiwan time, flying
home via a transit stopover in Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
Lee, accompanied by his wife and a 100-member entourage, began
his trip on Sept. 4 and is scheduled to arrive home on Friday. During
the tour, he visited Panama, Honduras, El Salvador and Paraguay,
signing separate joint communiques with the heads of state of these

</P>
<P>
Lee also signed a key joint communique with six of his Latin
American counterparts -- the presidents of Costa Rica, El Salvador,
Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua, and the Prime Minister of Belize
-- at an El Salvador summit meeting on Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of these ROC allies reiterated their firm support
for ROC's inclusion in international organizations, while Lee
committed ROC assistance to their economic development and promised
to encourage Taiwan investment in the region.
</P>
<P>
The president also declared that the ROC will participate in a
planned System of Central American Integration to contribute to the
free circulation of capital, goods, services and personnel in the
countries in the grouping.

Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui
and Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy on Tuesday jointly
presided over a ceremony to mark the construction of a new bridge in
the Paraguayan capital of Asuncion, with the two heads of state
hailing the bridge as a symbol of the long-lasting amicable relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Lee and Wasmosy jointly inaugurated a memorial plaque at the
construction site, witnessed by more than 100 ranking Paraguayan
government officials.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Lee said the construction of the bridge
is a reflection of the ROC's cordial ties with Paraguay, despite the
great geographic distance between the two countries. He also
expressed his appreciation to Paraguay for its long-time support for
the ROC.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Wasmosy said President Lee's visit to Paraguay is a
culmination of the good relations between the two countries. He
thanked the president for the ROC's assistance in building the
bridge, which he said will help Paraguay quicken the pace of its
economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
Wasmosy offered Lee reassurance of Paraguay's firm support for
the ROC and hailed the new bridge as a landmark in bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The bridge will connect the capital city with the Chaco region on
the other side of the city. The ROC government has agreed to make a
loan of US$30 million to aid construction of the 1,500-meter-long,
12-meter-wide bridge.

WORKER UNREST IN MAINLAND CHINA MAY SPREAD: MAC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 17 (CNA)
(By Hu Jinping and Eva Chen)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There has been much discussion in the 15th
National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) about the
reform of state-run enterprises and public ownership.
</P>
<P>
According to one analysis by Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC), the cabinet-level body set up to chart mainland China policy
in the absence of official ties, the recent outbreak of workers'
demonstrations in the mainland won't be checked because state-run
business has long been on the brink of bankruptcy and reforms are
long overdue.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment spawned by this situation will probably continue to
precipitate protests from the workers, even though Beijing is making
efforts to accelerate reforms in laws relating to public ownership.
</P>
<P>
The enormous scale of the workers' demonstrations in the province
of Szechuan this year have turned much international attention to the
problem. Workers' protests have long been considered by Beijing to be
one of the biggest threats to social stability in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The deterioration of the management of state-run businesses has
resulted in many cases of sabotage by workers, unemployment and wage
problems which, in turn, have triggered further protests, the MAC
analysis observed.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, a drastic increase of debt incurred by
public-owned businesses in 1996 -- to the tune of 73 billion yuan --
and an overall deficit occurred in the first quarter of the year.

Mainland China's Vice Minister of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation, Sun Gene, confessed recently that he
is not optimistic that President Jiang Zemin's upcoming trip to the
US will result in an agreement with Washington on World Trade
Organization (WTO) entry, but said he thinks that Jiang's trip will

Jiang's visit to Washington is a matter of great importance, as
it will surely promote the development of bilateral relations and be

However, he also pointed out that prior to and after Jiang's
visit, representatives of both sides will certainly bargain on the
remaining differences between them.

Sun added that to the best of his knowledge, no bargain will be
struck during Jiang's visit because there are still differences over

The Taipei-based Academia Sinica on
Wednesday signed a cooperation agreement in Taipei with the British
Academy to strengthen academic exchanges in the field of humanities.
</P>
<P>
Academia Sinica Vice President Yang Hsiang-fa and British Academy
Foreign Secretary Barry Supple jointly signed the agreement, which is
Academia Sinica's first step in the promotion of studies in the
humanities and social sciences.
</P>
<P>
Academia Sinica represents the highest academic institute of the
Republic of China and has been devoting to the promotion of natural
and applied sciences since its founding in 1928. Its current
president is Dr. Lee Yuan-tseh, a Nobel laureate in physics.
</P>
<P>
The British Academy, founded in 1901, is also a national academy
dedicated to the promotion of historical, philosophical and
philological studies. The academy enjoys as high a reputation in the
study of humanities as the Royal Society, the United Kingdom's
academy of the science, does in natural and applied sciences.
</P>
<P>
The independent and self-governing fellowship of scholars has so
far forged official academic cooperation agreements with 25 countries

PRESIDENT LEE PLANNING AFRICAN VISITS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

(By L.J. Yen and Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Lee Teng-hui said on Tuesday
that he plans to visit Africa next year and mentioned Senegal and
Burkina Faso, two ROC allies in West Africa without going into
details.
</P>
<P>
President Lee, who is currently visiting Paraguay, the last leg
of his four-nation Latin American tour, made the remarks during a
breakfast meeting with more than 50 reporters from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that many African nations have good leaders, but the
differences between African and Latin American nations lie in the
fact that although the latter have more abundant resources, they have
slower economic development.
</P>
<P>
He said that Africa's economic development will depend on whether
political situations will be stable, citing Senegal and Burkina Faso
as the two African nations with good leadership and stable
development.
</P>
<P>
The president also spoke of providing US$300 million over 12
years to the Central American Development Fund, saying that he wanted
to establish the stature of the ROC during his term by pushing for
pragmatic diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
Remarking on the prospects for his pragmatic diplomacy, he said
it will be conducted in stages, citing Paraguay as an example. He
said that not only is the ROC giving money to Paraguay, the aid will
be beneficial to the ROC's economy by providing more trade
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the system of Central American Integration,
with its population of 50 or 60 million, and Taiwan, with its 20
million population, can join forces, the two groups will wield a
great deal of power.
</P>
<P>
He continued that Paraguay is the ROC's only ally in South
America and that Taiwan can strengthen its relations with the South
American Common Market (Mercosur) through Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
He blasted the hegemonic mentality of Beijing, revealing that on
the eve of World Congress on the Panama Canal on Sept. 7, Beijing was
still pressuring Panama to keep him from addressing the opening
ceremony. Lee said that such an effort to stifle the ROC's presence
in the international community is "senseless."
</P>
<P>
He also said that leaders on both sides of the Taiwan Strait will
meet only when the time is "ripe," adding that the premise will be
that Beijing recognizes that Taiwan and mainland China are under
separate rule by two political entities of equal stature.
</P>
<P>
But Lee said Beijing believes that China should be under only its
rule, without regard for the fact that there are Chinese people who
live under freedom and democracy and there are people under the rule
of communism.
</P>
<P>
He also talked about his appreciation for the treatment rendered
by the US, saying that compared with his transit visit via Hawaii
three years ago, when he didn't even leave the plane, this time, he
was able to land and play golf and was met by Richard Bush, new board
chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He said that this shows that the US has changed its policy and
predicted that bilateral relations will continue to strengthen. He
also said that the nation should nurture more talent in the
diplomatic field to further boost its relations with European
nations.
</P>
<P>
He said that the European Parliament has been friendly to the
ROC, but the ROC has not yet had real contact with it, adding that
the future approach of diplomacy in this region will be centered on
economics.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the possibility of his visiting Japan, Lee said that
this was remote, since he does not want to invite trouble for Japan,
which is afraid of offending Beijing.

<P>
Rau Yin-chi, chairman of the ROC
branch of the World League for Freedom and Democracy (WLFD), said on
Tuesday that the focus of his work in future will be to push for
parliament diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
Rau, who is leading a delegation of legislators to attend the
WLFD's 29th annual conference in Washington, D.C., also said that
during the four-day conference, he will learn how to strengthen
parliament diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
Rau said that since assuming the WLFD chairmanship in May, he has
decided to push for pragmatic diplomacy through increased
communication between parliamentarians of the ROC and those of other
nations.
</P>
<P>
Members of the delegation include Chang Chun-hsiung and Parris
Chang of the Democratic Progressive Party; Yok Mu-ming and Kao Hui-yu
of the New Party; Ke Yu-ching and Cheng Fong-shih of the ruling
Kuomintang; and Chang Chin-cheng, who has no party affiliation.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether President Lee Teng-hui has spent too much money in
his own push for pragmatic diplomacy, Parris Chang said that during
his term as head of state, Lee has made six overseas trips over nine
years, which is far less than leaders of most other nations, adding
that he believes Lee should make more such trips.
</P>
<P>
He also said that analysis of Lee's current Latin American tour
should not center on how much money was spent, but whether the trip
will help promote trade development for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Kao Hui-yu said that she supports the idea of pragmatic
diplomacy, but believes that cross-strait relations, which have been
stalled since Lee's visit to the US in June 1995, should be developed
at the same time.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which will open on Wednesday, will gather nearly
100 delegates from over 60 countries.

COMMUNIST SYSTEM IN MAINLAND CHINA UNDERGOING TRANSFORMATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Canberra,  Sept. 17 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cradle-to-grave communist system in
mainland China is expected to undergo a transformation, if not
destruction, because of its growing economic freedom, but political
freedom is nowhere in sight, according to an editorial in the mass
circulation newspaper The Sydney Morning Herald on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The editorial, headlined "Chinese Menu" says: "By small degrees
the Communist Party of China is moving forward with its own
transformation, if not destruction. The development of economic
policy, drawn in broad outline at the opening of the 15th party
congress in Beijing, increases the distance between economic freedom,
which is now very great, and political freedom which, except in a
highly artificial sense, is still nowhere in sight."
</P>
<P>
The editorial notes that mainland China's market economy has made
great strides since the late Deng Xiaoping's "open door policy" in
the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says the economy will move even further along the
same path with a thorough shake-up of state-run enterprises and the
fact that the People's Liberation Army (PLA) is to be further reduced
by 500,000 by the turn of the century from its present strength of
3.1 million.
</P>
<P>
"Both these developments are well justified in terms of
efficiency, but risky. China is already paying for its spectacular
but uneven economic growth in widespread unemployment and rising
crime," the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says mainland China's stability under communism has
always depended on the alliance between the party and the armed
forces. But the PLA cannot stand against history. And the party,
despite 58 million members, cannot credibly claim to be
representative of mainland China's population of almost one billion.
</P>
<P>
"The more the economy opens up, the greater the corruption of
party officials, and the more the secretive ways of the party are
exposed," the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
It says: "The new centers of power based on the new economic
interests will insist on an open system that treats all players
equally and fairly. That demand, as much as general popular feeling,
will maintain the pressure for political reform, including
multi-party democracy and separation of legislative and executive
powers."
</P>
<P>
"A resulting democracy with Chinese characteristics may not be
identical with any in the West. But it will be far removed from the
present oligarchy," the editorial says.

FIGURES SHOW GROWING TAIWAN-CANADA TIES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Ottawa,  Sept. 16 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To date in 1997, as many as 10,375 people
from Taiwan have emigrated to Canada, making the island the
fourth-largest source of immigrants for the country, Canada's
Immigration Minister Lucienne Robillard said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Statistics Canada released a set of figures indicating
that in July 1997, 24,000 Taiwan nationals traveled to Canada for one
or more nights of stay, up 3.4 percent over the same month of last
year. This is the largest monthly growth rate among all major sources
of foreign travelers to Canada.
</P>
<P>
Even the number of Canadian MPs traveling to foreign countries
shows the trend of growing ties between Taiwan and Canada. "Taiwan
and US top the list of MP tour destinations," a headline in the
Monday edition of The Hill Times read.
</P>
<P>
According to the daily, which calls itself "Canada's
parliamentary newspaper," 18 MPs visited Taiwan on the host
government's bill during the last parliament which started in Nov.
1993 and ended in June 1997. The US, either directly or through
Congress, sponsored 26 free trips by separate Canadian MPs, the
front-page report noted.
</P>
<P>
For years, foreign governments, "especially Taiwan, Israel and
Cuba," have courted Canadian MPs as part of a campaign to maintain a
corps of sympathetic legislators in North America and European
countries, the Times said.
</P>
<P>
"The governments of Taiwan, Israel, Japan, Germany, France,
Germany, Greece and the United Kingdom all footed the bill for
Canadian MPs to visit their countries," it noted.
</P>
<P>
Government-sponsored trips also cover students in an exchange
program signed in May between educational institutions of Taiwan and
Canada. A group of 22 Taiwan students have recently arrived in Canada
to study in Toronto and Vancouver universities, while 12 Canadian
students are heading to Taiwan this month and in November.
</P>
<P>
Immigrants and tourists and many other students paid their way to
Canada, increasing Taiwan's "trade deficit" with Canada, according to
economics officials at the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in
Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
Investments and assets brought in by immigrants and payments by
tourists as well as students are not counted in the official trade
tallies.
</P>
<P>
For comparison, the latest 1997 immigrant figures are: Hong Kong,
18,200; mainland China, 14,000; India, 13,800; Taiwan, 10,375; and
Pakistan, 8,200. Robillard cited the figures to deny some media
reports that the Canadian government sets immigration quotas on a
country-by-country basis.
</P>
<P>
The July figures show that Taiwan was the third-largest source in
Asia of overseas travelers to Canada, after Japan (71,000) and South
Korea (26,000).

The rupiah and local stock prices

Both foreign exchange and stock markets seemed to be riding more

Sustained regional weakness and concern that the Ujungpandang

the state-owned and collectively-owned sectors.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Haoruo, Vice Minister of the State Commission for
Restructuring the Economy, pointed out at press conference on the
sidelines of the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of
China (CPC), that after extensive reform over the last few years,
mainland China's economic system has changed a lot, with public
ownership now the mainstream, coexisting with the development of
diversified forms of ownership.
</P>
<P>
Zhang revealed that during 1996, among the 6,800 billion yuan of
GDP, state-owned businesses accounted for 40.8 percent and
collectively-owned enterprises accounted for 35 percent, while the
individual, private and foreign business sectors accounted for 24
percent.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, public-owned enterprise, which includes state-owned
and collectively-owned businesses, accounted for as much as 75.8
percent of the GDP, giving it still the dominant position in mainland
China's economy, Zhang concluded.

THAILAND FACES WORST ECONOMIC CRISIS SINCE WW II

<DATELINE>
San Francisco, Sept. 16 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Francisco Chronicle painted
a miserable picture of Thailand, which it said faces its worst
economic crisis since World War II.
</P>
<P>
With the nation staggering under an increasingly expensive
foreign debt load and the national currency having fallen to around
40 percent of its previous value, industries ranging from finance and
property to garments, electronics, advertising and printing are
unable to find credit and are being pushed toward bankruptcy, said
the Chronicle in a feature story entitled "Thailand Teeters."
</P>
<P>
The speed at which the economy is unraveling is forcing
middle-class as well as poor Thais to make radical changes, both in
their spending habits and in their mental picture of their lives and
prospects, said the report, adding that only a few months ago, they
belonged to what was still heralded as one of the world's
fastest-growing economies.
</P>
<P>
Even religious activities have been hit hard by the economy
downturn. Buddhist monks describe a sharp drop in donations. But
sales of cheap instant noodles have soared, as people cut back on
food bills, indicated the report.

Ottawa,  Sept.  16  (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Women Leaders' Network from 18
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) economies ended a four-day
meeting on Tuesday with a call for their government leaders to
promote the full participation of women in business and society.
</P>
<P>
The 150-odd woman leaders, including six from the Republic of
China, said APEC leaders can help the fair sex by removing obstacles
they face in entering the business world.
</P>
<P>
Their recommendations include:
</P>
<P>
-- Recognize gender as a crosscutting issue in all APEC forums
and integrate a gender perspective at all levels of APEC work;
</P>
<P>
-- Approve the recommendation of APEC Senior Officials to convene
a Ministerial Meeting in the Philippines in 1998 to address women's
concerns more effectively in APEC; and
</P>
<P>
-- Ensure the full participation of women through equitable
representation at all levels of APEC, on APEC-appointed bodies, such
as the APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC) and all APEC activities.
</P>
<P>
These are among many recommendations tabled by more than 150
leaders from the private sector, government, academia and
non-governmental organizations in the second meeting of APEC Women
Leaders' Network (WLN).
</P>
<P>
The recommendations were received by John Manley, Canada's
minister of industry, and will be presented on Friday to APEC
Ministers Responsible for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises at their
upcoming meeting in Ottawa. The same recommendations will be
forwarded to APEC leaders who will meet in Vancouver in late November
this year.

AUSSIE DOLLAR HITS 27-MONTH LOW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Canberra,  Sept.  17 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Australian currency, hit by rumors
of further official interest rate cuts and the resignation of Prime
Minister John Howard, hit a 27-month low on Tuesday and dealers
predicted the dollar could drop further if the country's economy does
not improve at a rapid pace.
</P>
<P>
The dollar closed at 71.73 US cents on Tuesday and only improved
slightly in the early afternoon of Wednesday, trading at 71.92 US
cents.
</P>
<P>
However, the weak outlook for Australia's commodity exports and
speculation for further interest rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of
Australia will undermine the Australian currency and push the dollar
lower, possibly to below 71 US cents in the near term, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
Australia's commodity exports, including grains, will be hard-hit
in fiscal 1997-98 due to the current drought, with government
officials forecasting a loss of up to A$1 billion in lost production.
</P>
<P>
Australia mainly exports natural resources, including coal, iron
ore, oil and natural gas, aside from wheat, sugar, rice, barley and
seafoods.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics
predicted that Australia will harvest a wheat crop of around 16.2
million tons in 1997-98, down three million tons from an earlier
target.
</P>
<P>
It also forecast that Australia's farm exports could reach A$20.8
billion in fiscal 1997-98, down 4.2 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said all these unfavorable factors will drive the
Australian currency lower in the coming weeks unless there is good
news on economic growth, which is targeted to grow at 3.75 percent in
1997-98, with the central bank predicting it could go higher.

SITUATION IN UJUNGPANDANG SAID UNDER CONTROL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Jakarta,  Sept.  17  (CNA)
(By Wu Pin-chiang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Indonesian armed forces commander Gen.
Feisal Tanjung said Wednesday the police had quelled the riot that
began in Ujungpandang, the capital of South Sulawesi, on Monday and
that the situation there is under control.
</P>
<P>
Mobs of people went on a rampage throughout the city's center in
a riot with ethnic overtones on Monday night and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the city remained tense Tuesday night with
soldiers and police officers deployed in the Chinatown district,
which suffered the worst damage, the Jakarta Post reported.
</P>
<P>
The riot was provoked by rumors that a nine-year-old girl was
hacked to death by a man, said to be of a Chinese descent, on Monday
evening.
</P>
<P>
The alleged killer, believed to be insane, was later mobbed to
death by an angry crowd of people who later vented their anger by
attacking houses and shops belonging to ethnic Chinese residents.
</P>
<P>
South Sulawesi Police Chief Brig. Gen. Ali Hanafiah said Tuesday
that four people were killed.
</P>
<P>
Besides the girl and the alleged killer, a firemen died while
fighting a fire at one of the burning houses, and a woman suffocated
when she was trapped in her smoldering home. Around 10 people were
injured.
</P>
<P>
Police said a temple, eight houses and eight entertainment
centers were razed and more than 400 other buildings were damaged. In
addition, 51 cars and 58 motorcycles were either set on fire or
damaged.
</P>
<P>
Officials identified the nine-year-old girl as Anni Mujahidah
Rasulullah, and her attacker as 23-year-old Benny.
</P>
<P>
The head of Ujungpandang Mental Care Hospital, Deny Tong,
confirmed that Benny had been a patient there. "Benny was under
intensive treatment here for schizophrenia and paranoia," Deny told
the Jakarta Post.
</P>
<P>
According to the official version of events, Anni had just
finished attending a Koran reading lesson at 7 p.m. on Monday and was
on her way home when she was suddenly attacked by Benny.
</P>
<P>
Noro, Anni's 19-year-old aunt, was also attacked and suffered an
arm injury.
</P>
<P>
The girls' screams alerted the neighborhood. People rushed out,
disarmed Benny and beat him to death.
</P>
<P>
The angry mob immediately spilled onto the main streets, where
most ethnic Chinese people live and run their shops.
</P>
<P>
The riot went on into the early hours of Tuesday. It resumed
later in the morning with university students joining the mob,
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday morning, the mob set scores of shops ablaze along Jalan
Sulawesi, Jalan Nusantara and Jalan Irian. Two temples on Jalan
Sulawesi were burned to the ground, the Indonesian Observer reported.
</P>
<P>
A number of banks and supermarkets were also destroyed. No
official figures of losses or casualties were available Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The unrest continued to spread throughout different parts of the
city Tuesday, with more than 1,000 people involved, including youths
in high-school uniforms.
</P>
<P>
Shops throughout the city were closed Tuesday, and the atmosphere
remain tense late in the evening, while police blocked vehicles from
entering the city.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the riots Tuesday, Police Chief
Hanafiah, said Benny's violent action was purely criminal in nature.
</P>
<P>
"I have received information from medical sources that he was
suffering from a sort of paranoia. He always feared others and saw
them as his enemies," said Hanafiah.
</P>
<P>
He said 79 people have been detained for further questioning.

Melbourne's Crown Casino, the biggest
gambling den in the Southern Hemisphere and one of the largest in the
world, is aggressively wooing people from both sides of the Taiwan
Strait to gamble and stay in its luxurious hotel.
</P>
<P>
Gary O'Neill, general media manager of the Crown Casino, said the
company will set up its first office in Shanghai before the end of
this year to attract people from the biggest city in mainland China.
</P>
<P>
He said Crown Casino last month made a promotional blitz in
television, newspaper and radio in Taiwan to lure punters.
</P>
<P>
"We are promoting our hotel complex as the top class holiday
resort destination in Taiwan and will be doing the same in Shanghai
after we set up the office there," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Crown Casino is negotiating with Taiwan's EVA Airways to
increase regular flights between Melbourne and Taipei. In addition,
the casino is also seeking to operate charter flights between
Melbourne and Taipei so that they can bring even more people from
Taiwan and empty their wallets.
</P>
<P>
The casino set up its first office in Taipei in February this
year. O'Neill said the company has also set up similar offices in
Hong Kong, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and Jakarta.

CIB HEAD MEETS WITH FBI EXPERTS TO EXCHANGE ANTI-CRIME VIEWS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 17 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yang Tzu-ching, head of Taiwan's Criminal
Investigation Bureau (CIB), met here Wednesday with several visiting
members of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), exchanging
views on how to combat cyber crime.
</P>
<P>
The recent case related to the "Godfather of Firearms," a
Chinese-language website promoting an Internet firearms business,
highlighted the cyber crime problem on the island, which law
enforcement authorities have little experience dealing with.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Yang sought to tap the FBI's expertise and
experience in fighting high tech crimes. The United States tops the
world in managing cyber crime, which has been expanding around the
globe as more and more people gain Internet access.
</P>
<P>
Yang also asked for US assistance in investigating another
firearms trade case that erupted here early this month.
</P>
<P>
It is illegal to own or sell guns in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The CIB computer crime task force said that although it had
arrested Yang Chien-min, the 21-year-old technical college graduate
suspected of being behind the "Godfather of Firearms," it believes he
had the assistance of others, likely including foreigners, in the
sale of guns.
</P>
<P>
Yang allegedly copied firearms pictures from websites on the
Internet and then used them to help advertise his weapons business on
Internet bulletin board systems. Reports have said that some Taiwan
residents have purchased weapons through the website.

UN AGENCY CONDEMNS IMPACT OF GLOBALIZATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva,  Sept.  17  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Widening economic and social divisions
accompanying globalization threaten a political backlash that could
reverse the gains of increased economic integration, the Geneva-based
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In its 1997 Trade and Development Report, UNCTAD pointed out that
in contrast to more optimistic assessments from the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank, "evidence is mounting that slow growth
and rising inequalities are becoming more permanent features" of the
world economic landscape.
</P>
<P>
The report will provide ammunition for those who argue that the
costs of globalization are being borne by those that can least afford
it -- but UNCTAD rejects trade protectionism as a counter-measure,
arguing instead for policies to distribute the benefits of
globalization more evenly.
</P>
<P>
Inequalities have grown both between industrialized and
developing countries and between rich and poor within countries, the
report said. The gap between per capita incomes in the world's seven
richest and seven poorest countries has risen from 20 times in 1965
to 39 times in 1995, UNCTAD said.
</P>
<P>
Though a handful of east Asian countries have narrowed or closed
the gap on the developed world, most developing countries have fallen
behind. The income share of the richest 20 percent of the population
has also risen "almost everywhere" since the early 1980s, while those
at the bottom have seen their living standards stagnate or fall, it
added.

US COURT GRANTS BAIL TO TAIWAN BUSINESSMAN AND HIS DAUGHTER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,   Sept.   16   (CNA)
(By Herman Pan &amp; Lin Wen-fen)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two officials of a Taiwan
self-adhesive products company who were arrested Sept. 4 on
industrial espionage charges were granted bail Tuesday of US$500,000
each by a federal court in Cleveland, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
Yang Pin-yen, president of the Taipei-based Four Pillars
Enterprises Co. Ltd., a leading maker of self-adhesive tape in
Taiwan, and his daughter, Yang Hwei-chen, project manager of Four
Pillars' research and development department, are expected to be
released on Wednesday, when the bail procedure will be complete.
</P>
<P>
Yang, 70, and his 39-year-old daughter were nabbed by FBI agents
on Sept. 4 at Hopkins International Airport in Cleveland, Ohio, where
they were to board a plane to Newark, New Jersey. They were accused
of stealing trade secrets from Avery Dennison Corp., based in
Pasadena, California, one of the largest makers of self-adhesive
products in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The decision to grant bail was made mainly on the grounds that
the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Chicago submitted a
statement to the court, declaring that no ROC embassies or
representative offices anywhere in the world would issue passports to
the two accused ROC nationals, whose passports were confiscated by
the court.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Peter Toren argued at the hearing that as the US
government doesn't recognize Taiwan as a sovereign state, the
statement presented by the Taiwan officials should be invalid. The
judge, however, overruled the objection and set bail at US$500,000
each.
</P>
<P>
As part of the conditions for their bail, the Yangs have to
remain in Ohio -- and wear devices that will reveal their compliance
with this -- and only make monitored calls to Taiwan. They can also
receive visitors but are subject to court summons.
</P>
<P>
Toren said that Yang and his daughter will be indicted on mail
and wire fraud, conspiracy, money laundering and receipt of stolen
goods and stolen trade secrets by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Avery Dennison has filed a case in civil court
against the two and Four Pillars, claiming the stolen trade secrets
had cost it millions of dollars and asking for a correspondingly huge
compensation. The hearing will begin Sept. 25.
</P>
<P>
Yang and his daughter were present in the courtroom to hear the
decision. They insisted on their innocence and said that they hope
their lawyers can help clear them of the charges. They also expressed
gratitude for the help the ROC officials stationed in the United
States had offered them.

<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan will continue to enjoy high
economic growth in 1997 and 1998, the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The IMF's semi-annual World Economic Outlook report said that
Taiwan is enjoying rapid growth and modest inflation.
</P>
<P>
It forecast economic growth in Taiwan of 6.2 percent this year,
up from 5.7 percent last year. The expansion in 1998 will rise to 6.4
percent, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report also forecast strong global growth, saying that the
world economy will grow 4.2 percent in 1997 and 4.3 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Group of Seven Industrialized Countries will post 2.8 percent
growth in 1997 and 2.5 percent in 1998, it said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan fell under the "other industrialized nations" category,
along with South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand,
Ireland, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Austria, Denmark,
Finland, Greece, Portugal, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Norway, Israel
and Iceland. These countries are expected to have an overall growth
of 2.8 percent in 1997 and 2.5 percent the following year.
</P>
<P>
In this category, Ireland led other economies with a 7.3 percent
growth forecast for 1997, followed by Taiwan at 6.2 percent, South
Korea at 6 percent, Singapore at 6 percent, Hong Kong at 5.3 percent
and Finland, 4.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report said that for 1998, however, Taiwan should lead the
group with 6.4 percent growth. South Korea will take the second
position at 6 percent, while Ireland will grow at 5.8 percent,
Singapore at 5.5 percent and Hong Kong at 5 percent, it said.

The Ministry of Economic Affairs on
Wednesday approved the resignation of Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC)
Chairman S.J. Lee over a gas explosion that killed five and seriously
injured another 20 in the southern Taiwan port city of Kaohsiung on
Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
Lee said in his letter of resignation that as head of the
state-run company he should take full responsibility for the mishap,
adding that he hopes his departure will "lift the morale" of CPC
employees and teach them a lesson on the importance of industrial
safety.
</P>
<P>
But at the insistence of Lee, the ministry refused to accept the
resignation of CPC President Pan Wen-yen, saying he was needed to
take care of the aftermath of the accident, Vice Economics Minister
Chang Chang-pang told the press Wednesday afternoon. Pan was
disciplined instead.
</P>
<P>
The CPC, which has had a number of major accidents recently,
earlier in the day announced a list of 13 officials censured for the
incident, including the firing of Kaohsiung Refinery Plant Director
Chen Pao-lang.
</P>
<P>
A ministry task force investigating the accident has determined
that human error was the main cause of the tragedy.
</P>

The accident took place when CPC technicians and contract workers

<P>
Premier Vincent Siew on Wednesday defended
the government's "no haste, be patient" economic policy toward
mainland China, saying it is aimed at pursuing a stable cross-strait
relationship.
</P>
<P>
Siew said that as mainland China has not shown any good will on
cross-strait relations, the government has to stick to the policy in
the hope that it will prompt Beijing to review its Taiwan policy and
reopen cross-strait talks.
</P>
<P>
Siew told a gathering of businessmen celebrating the moon
festival that the government also hopes the policy will serve as a
reminder to Taiwan businessmen, especially those running large
enterprises, that while investing in mainland China they should also
keep their roots in Taiwan and contribute to the continuing and solid
development of the island.
</P>
<P>
If the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can establish good
relations and end hostility, much closer trade and economic
cooperation, including direct shipping links, can be expected, Siew
said.
</P>
<P>
Siew also said that Taiwan investors can be seen as a bridge
across the strait, helping the two sides understand each other
better. Taiwan businessmen can try to help mainland China understand
Taiwan's sincerity in improving cross-strait relations so as to
dispel or avoid any misunderstanding, he added.

PRESIDENT LEE WINDS UP VISIT TO PARAGUAY WITH PRESS CONFERENCE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Latin America's steady political
situation, rich natural resources, industrious people and its firm
friendship with the Republic of China make it a perfect place to
accommodate Taiwan investment, said ROC President Lee Teng-hui here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held jointly with Paraguayan President Juan
Carlos Wasmosy at the end of his four-day visit here, Lee said Latin
America could be an important source of raw materials for Taiwan in
the island's bid to become a regional operations hub.
</P>
<P>
He said he is confident that the ROC's solid ties with Paraguay,
noting that these exist as links between two countries rather than
two ruling parties, will survive whatever the results of next year's
presidential election in Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
Wasmosy echoed Lee's opinions at the press conference, saying
that all the agreements the two countries signed during Lee's trip
will be faithfully carried through by his successor after he leaves
office at the end of his term next year.
</P>
<P>
He also touted his country's health, economic and financial
systems, and its geographically privileged position as the doorway to
huge South American markets in a bid to woo Taiwan's investors.
</P>
<P>
Lee capped his visit here by signing a joint communique with
Wasmosy on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the communique, Paraguay acknowledged again that the ROC is a
sovereign state and said it respects the ROC's rejection of Beijing's
"one country, two systems" formula for China's reunification.
Paraguay also reconfirmed its support for the ROC's bid to rejoin the
United Nations and thanked Taiwan for its support for Paraguay's
development projects.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the ROC promised to encourage its private
sector to make investments in the South American country, open its
market to Paraguayan meat and other products, and help Paraguay to
develop Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
The two sides vowed to fight jointly against terrorism and drug
trafficking, as well as to promote mutual friendship.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, the two countries also signed an aviation
accord, a protocol for the promotion of mutual economic ties and a
letter of intent on a loan to Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
The aviation accord -- signed for the ROC by Vice Premier and
Foreign Minister John Chang, and Minister of Transportation and
Communications Tsay Jaw-yang and for Paraguay by Foreign Minister
Buben Melgarejo Lanzoni and Defense Minister Hugo Estigarribia
Elizeche -- allows the airlines appointed by each side to operate
flights between the capitals of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Melgarejo also signed a protocol with ROC Minister of Economic
Affairs Wang Chih-kang in which both sides promised to wipe out
non-tariff barriers to mutual trade.
</P>
<P>
The protocol calls for the lifting of trade quotas, stepping up
the protection of intellectual property rights and the formation of a
joint committee to monitor the implementation of the protocol.
</P>
<P>
Taipei had been trying to conclude a free trade agreement with
Asuncion but settled for a protocol because Asuncion, as a member of
the Southern Common Market -- which also includes Argentina, Brazil
and Uruguay -- is no longer free to conclude such pacts with other
countries.
</P>
<P>
In the letter of intent to loan -- signed by ROC Council of
Agriculture Chairman Peng Tso-kuei and his Paraguayan counterpart,
Cayo Franco -- Taipei agreed to loan US$20 million to Asuncion to
help the development of Paraguay's agriculture, in addition to giving
a grant of US$1 million to promote agricultural training in that
country.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate, terms and other details of the loan will be
determined in future negotiations.
</P>
<P>
President Lee and his entourage arrived here on Sunday on the
last leg of a Latin American trip designed to cement Taipei's ties
with its diplomatic allies in the region. He is slated to leave
Paraguay on Thursday.

WLFD OPENS THREE-DAY MEETING IN WASHINGTON
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Sept. 17 (CNA)
(By Bill Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The president of the World League for
Freedom and Democracy (WLFD) Wednesday called on nations to build
mutual trust by working more closely in the face of common challenges
such as international terrorism, environmental protection, drug
trafficking and a rapidly rising global population.
</P>
<P>
Chao Tze-chi said at the opening ceremony of the 29th WLFD
general assembly that the activities and interests of different
people in the current global economy are more closely connected than
at any time in the past.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Chao went on, policy-makers must always keep in mind
the welfare of the world as a whole and shun policies that pursue
irresponsible self-interests.
</P>
<P>
While the WLFD has made some achievements in the struggle for
human freedom and equality and in its fight against totalitarianism
and dictatorship in the past 40 years, he said, it must continue to
uphold the ideals of freedom and democracy with courage and
conviction in order to help usher in a new millennium embodying such
ideals.
</P>
<P>
Among other speakers was Ivan Michailovich Korotchenya, executive
secretary of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), who noted
that CIS members have been actively participating in WLFD activities
because they share the same ideals of freedom, democracy and
humanitarianism.
</P>
<P>
President Lee Teng-hui of the Republic of China on Taiwan, US
House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) and Sen. Robert G. Toricelli
(D-NJ) were among those sending messages wishing the WLFD a
successful gathering.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 100 delegates from 60 countries are participating in the
three-day conference under the theme of "Toward a Better and a More
Secure World." The delegates will also call at the US Congress and
the State Department and receive briefings about US foreign policy.

TAIWAN WOMEN TELL APEC THEY CAN DO BUSINESS TOO
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Ottawa,  Sept.  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ottawa Citizen on Wednesday used Taiwan
business women's success story to drive home a message to APEC
leaders: Barriers must fall so that half of their population can
fully contribute to the economy.
</P>
<P>
The four-column report, by Bert Hill, began with the story of Lin
Lee, who ran a successful family business for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
But though she was the financial brains of the business, she "had
no real power -- a situation shared by many businesswomen in the
male-dominated business world of many Pacific Rim nations," the
report pointed out.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Lin as telling the second APEC Women Leaders Network
(WLN) meeting on Tuesday, "I worked for 15 years without a salary,
without a title and without appreciation." Two years ago, Lin had had
enough. She set up the Ming-Hsouei Innovation Incubator, a
Taipei-based enterprise that helps small businesses get started, the
Citizen said.
</P>
<P>
One reason is her 22-year-old daughter, now a university student.
"I wanted to show her you didn't have to work for 10 years to make a
business succeed, that with the right ideas and management it can
happen much faster," Lin was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
So far, 10 tiny companies are growing under her wing, nurtured by
her ability to help find finances and provide management advice, the
report added. Lin is now also president of the Foundation of
Strategic Alliance of the Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
The Citizen pointed out that Lin's story is one of many that came
out of the four-day meeting in Hull, near Ottawa, where APEC
ministers responsible for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) will
meet on Thursday and Friday. One goal for the ministers is to open up
export opportunities for SMEs.
</P>
<P>
Hope Ong, alliance director of IBM-Taiwan, said electronic
commerce provides an avenue for businesswomen to break into the male
business world.
</P>
<P>
She said the technology is not expensive -- an important issue in
an economy where women lose their assets when they marry and there
they must still provide their husbands' signature in order to get a
bank loan, according to the Citizen.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Ong, "Your clients don't even have to know you are a
woman. The business is as big as a computer screen and all you have
to do ... is communicate over a computer."
</P>
<P>
Lin, Ong and other WLN participants sent a strong message to APEC
that they expect leaders from around the Pacific Rim to break down
the financial, marketing, technology and training barriers that
prevent women from participating in their economies.
</P>
<P>
Canada's Industry Minister John Manley, host of this week's SME
meetings, said he got the message. "If half of the population is
underrepresented in entrepreneurial activities, then all our nations
will not do as well as they should," he said.

US STRATEGY OF ENGAGEMENT WITH BEIJING CHALLENGED
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Sept.  17 (CNA)
(By Bill Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A US expert Wednesday challenged the
Clinton administration's mainland China policy, saying that the least
prudent thing Washington could do would be to shape its foreign and
defense policies around the most optimistic scenarios for Beijing's
future course.
</P>
<P>
Robert Kagan, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, said in testimony before the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee that current relations between Washington and
Beijing call for a prudent strategy, one that is capable of
responding to both optimistic and pessimistic scenarios for Beijing's
behavior in the future.
</P>
<P>
Noting that a prudent strategy should not be confused with
timidity, Kagan said, "Those who usually claim the mantle of prudence
in dealing with China insist that the only safe strategy is one that
does not seek confrontation, does not use pressure, does not ruffle
Chinese feathers, does not, in fact, treat China as if it were a
problem at all."
</P>
<P>
Kagan expressed doubts about assertions that economic
modernization goes hand in hand with political liberalization and
that Beijing can be guided peacefully toward playing a full and
responsible role in the existing international order.
</P>
<P>
He argued that the communist giant's economic boom may create
pressures for political reform, but it also gives the government
resources to contain those pressures. "Thus China's current economic
success puts off the day when the leadership must face the apparent
contradiction between tyrannical government and a more open economy,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
It is equally imprudent to base American strategy on the
assumption that Beijing's international behavior can be tamed through
"integration" into the international order, he went on.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that Washington's strategy toward Beijing
must have elements of containment in it, saying a policy that offers
carrots only, and that does not even admit the possibility of sticks,
can only tempt Beijing leaders to try and get away with as much as
they can.

TAIWAN NEEDS COMPREHENSIVE MEASURES TO PREVENT VOCATIONAL ACCIDENTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  18  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Kaohsiung gas explosion that killed
five and injured another 20 all too dramatically reveals the island's
lack of experience and comprehensive measures for the prevention of
vocational accidents.
</P>
<P>
The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
(DGBAS), citing its latest statistics, indicated that a total of 13
serious vocational accidents resulting in casualties and/or
significant environmental pollution took place in direct link with
the state-funded Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) in the fiscal 1997,
which began on July 1, 1996 and ended on June 30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The CPC paid out approximately NT$380 million (US$13.28 million)
over these tragedies, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
CPC Chairman S.J. Lee has resigned from his post to shoulder the
responsibility for the most recent accident, which happened on Sept.
13 when CPC technicians and contract workers tried to unearth a
section of gas pipeline as part of a road construction plan in
downtown Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In the explosion, five households were entirely destroyed and
another 18 were seriously damaged. A total of 97 motorcycles and
other vehicles, including three fire trucks, were badly burned.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to the DGBAS statistics, in 1996 there were
531 serious vocational accidents, defined as those resulting in at
least one loss of life or serious injury, on the island.
</P>
<P>
The figure registered a 7.9 percent rise in comparison with the
level of a year ago.
</P>
<P>
A total of 553 persons died in these accidents, up 11.3 percent
from the year-earlier-level, while the number of seriously injured
jumped 16.3 percent to 50, the statistics showed.

SIX KILLED IN UJUNGPANDANG RIOTS

<TEXT>
<P>
Security authorities are in control over
Ujungpandang, although the situation there remains tense following
Monday night's outbreak of violence, the Jakarta Post said in a
report from the riot-torn city.
</P>
<P>
Thousand of troops and police were seen on alert along the
streets throughout the day, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Business centers and schools remained closed as shock and fear
overwhelmed most parts of the city.
</P>
<P>
Thousands rioted on Monday night and Tuesday following the murder
of a 9-year-old girl by an ethnic Chinese youth, who was reportedly
mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
Fire continued to raze shops Wednesday afternoon. Witnesses said
some shops were often left burning as fire departments ran out of
water to extinguish the flames.
</P>
<P>
Masses of people tried to force themselves into the ethnic
Chinese district, but the security forces managed to keep them at
bay.
</P>
<P>
Separately, angry students of the Alaudin state-run Islamic
Institute launched a demonstration at their campus Wednesday.
Witnesses said security forces opened fire after the group set fire
to rubber stacks.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the provincial police Brig. Gen. Ali Hanafiah told a
press conference later that day that eight people were wounded in the
incident. Hanafiah said they included a fireman who was shot by
accident as he was extinguishing the fire.
</P>
<P>
Hanafiah said Wednesday that as of Tuesday, eight night clubs, a
Buddhist temple, a Protestant church, 25 shops, 10 cars and 58
motorcycles were burned.
</P>
<P>
Another 67 cars, 100 motorcycles and 1,471 shops were damaged, he
added.
</P>
<P>
According to Hanafiah, the death toll in the riot increased to
six when the remains of two women were found at a razed pub
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hanafiah said that as of Wednesday over 200 people had been
questioned. Most of them were detained for their alleged role in the
riots and looting.
</P>
<P>
He said some 300 ethnic Chinese had sought refuge at Ujungpandang
Police Headquarters following Tuesday's riots.
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday evening, only 80 remained there.

ZHAO ZIYANG, THE CHINESE GHOST THAT CAN TALK
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Ottawa, Sept. 17 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As thousands gathered this week in Beijing
for the 15th national congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC),
Zhao Ziyang was the ghost at the banquet, a Canadian columnist said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Marcus Gee, writing for The Globe and Mail's "International
Affairs" column, pointed out, "Worse, he was a ghost that could
speak."
</P>
<P>
Gee was referring to a letter Zhao wrote to the congress asking
the party to revise its judgment on the Tiananmen democracy movement.
"The last time the Chinese people saw Zhao Ziyang, he had tears in
his eyes," according to Gee.
</P>
<P>
It was May 19, 1989, and Zhao was pleading with students to leave
Tiananmen Square, which later became the site of a massacre. The
tragedy drove Zhao, then general secretary of the CPC, out of power
and brought in the current top leader, Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
So Zhao's letter "is an unpleasant jolt" for Jiang, Gee said. Any
reassessment of the June 4, 1989 tragedy could raise uncomfortable
questions about Jiang's political legitimacy, he wrote, adding that
it could also raise the touchy subject of political reform.
</P>
<P>
Under the surface, mainland China is a "profoundly troubled
country," Gee wrote, noting corruption is rampant, wage gaps between
rural and urban dwellers are growing, the banking system is flirting
with bankruptcy and the environment is a mess.
</P>
<P>
"These troubles can never be put right as long as China is run by
unelected, unaccountable officials whose main goal is to keep
themselves in power forever," Gee opined.

AUSSIE POLICE SQUAD TARGETS ASIAN HEROIN DEALERS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Canberra,  Sept.  18  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Australia has organized a nationwide
police squad aimed at targeting at least 30 "entrepreneurial" Asian
heroin traffickers in a bid to eliminate the international heroin
trade between Hong Kong, Indochina and Australia.
</P>
<P>
The squad is acting on intelligence profiles of the big-time
dealers, aged between 20 and 60.
</P>
<P>
The drug offensive by the Asian Organized Crime Group is aimed at
smashing prolific Southeast Asian drug syndicates, which are
responsible for the importation and distribution of 90 percent of
Australia's heroin supply.
</P>
<P>
Sydney is the busiest drug trafficking venue. Melbourne, Brisbane
and Perth also have their share of serious drug dealing operations.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said the police operation comes in the wake of
growing concern over the national heroin issue. Police said 620
people died of heroin overdoses last year.
</P>
<P>
Police are now scrutinizing principal Asian heroin dealers in
Sydney and their movements in places such as the Sydney Harbor
Casino, the Crown Casino in Melbourne and other similar places in
Brisbane and Perth.
</P>
<P>
Police said the elite police squad would use every available
resource to break up the drug syndicates in Sydney and other cities.
</P>
<P>
"The message is, if you're a commercial dealer in heroin in the
Asian community, particularly Sydney, the easy days are over for you
-- it's a matter of whose number comes up first," federal agent Ray
Tinker said.
</P>
<P>
"We will use all the weapons and means we have in our arsenal to
disrupt and dismantle these syndicates nationally and internationally
... and strip them of the ill-gotten gains they have made in the
heroin trafficking industry," he added.

INDONESIA SAYS BARRIERS HAMPER ITS EXPORTS TO TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Jakarta,  Sept.  18  (CNA)
(By Wu Pin-Chiang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Directorate for Bilateral Trade
Relations of the Indonesian Ministry of Industry and Trade has
identified at least seven non-tariff barriers that may hamper
Indonesian non-oil exports to Taiwan, the official Antara news agency
has reported.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's report, received by the news agency Tuesday, said
that non-tariff barriers, aside from the normal tariffs, have
resulted in a decline in Indonesia's share in the Taiwan market from
2.08 percent in 1995 to 1.84 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's non-tariff barriers include a health department rule
that imported fishery products must conform with cholera quarantine
regulations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the import of animals and plants must conform with
legal animal commodity and plant quarantine regulations, issued by
the Bureau of Commodity Inspection and Quarantine of the Economic
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Imported tea, fresh and frozen bamboo shoots should have a permit
from the Customs Office with a certificate of origin issued by the
country of origin or the relevant units authorized by the government.
</P>
<P>
As for processed goods -- like meat, fish, shrimp, vegetables,
fruit, beans or part of plants -- these should be accompanied by a
letter from the Taiwan Food Bureau.
</P>
<P>
For importing fertilizer, a photocopy of the fertilizer
registration certificate issued by the Forestry and Agriculture
Department will be needed.
</P>
<P>
As for the import into Taiwan of food additives (food seasoning),
a permit issued by the local health department should be attached.
</P>
<P>
Aside from these non-tariff barriers, several Indonesian primary
export commodities to Taiwan are also subject to fairly high tariffs.
</P>
<P>
For machinery and electrical appliances, Indonesian products are
subject to a 59.8 percent tax; coffee, tea, chocolate and spices
26.25 percent; non-ferrous metals 14.75 percent; and wood products
11.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Furniture is taxed 11.25 percent; textile yarn, textile cloth and
its derivatives 9.38 percent; organic chemical products 8.00 percent;
paper, cardboard and derivatives 5.13 percent; and natural, synthetic
and processed rubber 2.25 percent.

FOREIGN, NATIVE-BORN US CITIZENS HAVE SAME HOME OWNERSHIP RATE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
New  York,  Sept.  17  (CNA)
(By David Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Foreign-born citizens in 1996 owned
homes at about the same rate as the native-born population, according
to a study released this week by the US Bureau of the Census, showing
that home ownership remains an integral part of the American
experience.
</P>
<P>
The report, titled "Moving to America: Moving to Homeownership,"
shows that in 1996 the home ownership rate of foreign-born citizens
was 66.9 percent, compared with 67.4 percent for those born in the
United States. However, for noncitizens, only 33.1 percent surveyed
in 1996 owned homes.
</P>
<P>
The report goes to show that the difference in home ownership
rates of native-born and foreign-born citizens was greater in the
Northeast: 65.2 percent compared with 60.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the reverse was true in the Midwest and West. The
naturalized population in these two regions had a slightly higher
rate of home ownership than those born in the United States. In the
South, the difference between the two groups was nominal.
</P>
<P>
Other findings in the study include:
</P>
<P>
-- A high home-ownership rate, 77.1 percent, was found among
foreign-born citizens who immigrated to the United States before
1970. The same holds true for noncitizens who entered before 1970
(61.1 percent).
</P>
<P>
-- Hispanic foreign-born citizens were more likely to own homes
(57.1 percent) than native-born Hispanics (48.1 percent).
</P>
<P>
-- The home-ownership rate for those born in the United States

15TH CPC CONGRESS ELECTS CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEMBERS

<TEXT>
<P>
The 15th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) closed here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Delegates elected the members of the CPC Central Committee and
the new Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) were
elected during the day's closing session.
</P>
<P>
Both domestic and foreign reporters covering the congress were
told they would be able to report the closing ceremony of the
congress from the balcony of the meeting hall. But the elections were
held behind closed doors just as at the 14th Party Congress,
reporters were not allowed to witness the actual process of electing
members of the Central Committee. And the list of the newly-elected
members was circulated only after much delay because it had to be
thoroughly double-checked.
</P>
<P>
This year's congress approved amendments to the CPC Constitution
that adhere to Deng Xiaoping's line, which will have a significant
bearing on the future course of the CPC. In passing these amendments,
Beijing proclaimed to the world that the third generation of
leadership with Jiang Zemin at the core will adhere to Deng's opening
and reform policies into the next century.
</P>
<P>
The CPC will hold its first plenary session of the 15th CPC
congress Friday to decide on its new general secretary, approve the
choice of CCDI secretary, and elect the members of the Political
Bureau, Standing Committee of the Political Bureau, Central Military
Commission and Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
After the session, all members of the new Standing Committee of
the Political Bureau under the leadership of CPC General Secretary
Jiang Zemin are going to meet the press about 10:30 a.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
It is not certain whether Jiang will answer questions from
reporters. At the 14th congress five years ago, Jiang introduced the
new members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau and
said a few words but didn't answer reporters' questions.

President Lee Teng-hui of the Republic of
China, accompanied by his wife and a 100-member entourage, arrived in
Hawaii Wednesday evening (Thursday noon, Taipei Time) for an
overnight transit stay en route back home to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lee will fly to Taipei on Thursday afternoon, concluding his
16-day significant state visit to Latin America, during which the
president visited Panama, Honduras, El Salvador and Paraguay, and
attended two separate key conferences -- the world Congress on Panama
Canal and first summit meeting between the ROC and six Central
American countries.
</P>
<P>
This is Lee's first overseas journey since he became the first
popularly elected president of the nation in May, 1996, and also his
first major trip abroad after his landmark visit to his alma mater in
the United States in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The president and his wife were greeted at Kona International
Airport on the island of Hawaii, the largest in the island chain, by
Richard Bush, chairman and managing director of the American
Institute in Taiwan; Jason Hu, the ROC's representative to the United
States; and several officials from the Hawaiian State Government.

UNEMPLOYMENT SERIOUS IN M'LAND CHINA WITH 135 MILLION OUT OF WORK
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

(By Eva Chen)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland China has a very serious
unemployment problem, with 135 million of its people formally
registered as out of work, laid off or redundant farm labor. That
number accounts for more than 10 percent of the country's total
population.
</P>
<P>
The mainland labor force -- 723 million people in 1995 -- is more
than 1.9 times the total of that of developed countries and 29
percent of the world's total. Solving the persistent and difficult
employment problem is therefore critical to the mainland economy.
</P>
<P>
The reform policies of the late 1970s brought a rapid economic
boom and an abundance of job opportunities. From 1980 to 1989, the
employed segment of the population increased 3 percent annually,
compared to an overall average population growth of 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
But in the 1990s the job market has shrunk substantially, with
only 36 million job opportunities in cities for 54 million new job
seekers and 22 million laid off workers.

Police from the Criminal Investigation
Bureau on Thursday took back a man wanted in Taiwan from Xiamen,
mainland China via the Taiwan-controlled island of Kinmen, northwest
of Taiwan, under the witness of officials of the Red Cross societies
of both Taiwan and the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The suspect, identified as Tsai Chih-wui, 27, snuck into mainland
China in April after allegedly embezzling a large sum of money from
his employer, Chinatrust Commercial Bank (CCB).
</P>
<P>
The former CCB clerk is accused of having counterfeited bankbooks
and chop marks of bank customers, and of using these to pilfer some
NT$31 million (US$1.08 million) from the bank.
</P>
<P>
In Taiwan, people commonly use name chops rather than signatures
to identify themselves on official documents.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan authorities in July asked the Red Cross Society here to
seek the aid of its mainland counterpart and law enforcement units
there in hunting for Tsai. Mainland police then arrested Tsai in
Shenzhen, Guangdong Province on charges of damaging financial
systems.
</P>
<P>
The mainland police transferred Tsai to Xiamen, where his
handover to Taiwan law enforcement officers was witnessed by
officials of the Red Cross societies of both sides. Tsai will face
charges in Taiwan.

BEIJING'S  GROWING  TRADE  SURPLUS MAY STRAIN SUMMIT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva,  Sept.  18 (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing's growing trade surplus with the
US this year risks straining next month's summit between President
Bill Clinton and Jiang Zemin, his mainland Chinese counterpart,
according to reports from the Geneva-based World Trade Organization
(WTO) on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The WTO report said a record domestic grain harvest had reduced
mainland China's need for imported grain, the main US export, causing
the increased trade surplus.
</P>
<P>
US critics of mainland China have stepped up agitation over a
bulging surplus which reached US$39.5 billion last year, and was 35
percent higher in the first six months of this year compared with the
same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Mainland Chinese officials were pessimistic about a breakthrough
on Beijing's early entry into the WTO. "We are not overly optimistic
about reaching an agreement during Jiang's visit to Washington," they
were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
WTO negotiators said Beijing is far from satisfying requirements
for entry. Its offers to open its services sector, one of the main
sticking points, have been derisory.
</P>
<P>
The WTO working group on mainland China reconvenes in Geneva next
month to study Beijing's latest proposals. That meeting will help
define discussion on WTO entry at the Clinton-Jiang summit, the WTO
report said.

ROC'S UN BID IS LONG-TERM GOAL: ACTING FOREIGN MINISTER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 18 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government will continue its long-term
efforts to rejoin the United Nations despite a new setback for the
Republic of China at the world body, Chen Chien-jen, acting minister
of Foreign Affairs, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But Chen also said that the government will review its strategy
in the UN bid after the general assembly concludes its current
session.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks after the United Nations on Wednesday
rejected a petition by 14 countries asking the UN steering committee
to put Taipei's readmission on the agenda of the current session of
the 185-member General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
After a two-hour and 45-minute debate, Hennadiy Odovenko,
chairman of the committee, ruled that the proposal would not be put
on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
This is the fifth straight year that the ROC's attempt to rejoin
the world body suffered a defeat.
</P>
<P>
The 15 countries that spoke for the ROC were the Solomon Islands,
Honduras, Senegal, Swaziland, Burkina Faso, Gambia, Liberia,
Nicaragua, Chad, Papua New Guinea, Dominica, Saint Vincent and the
Grenadines, Guinea-Bissau, Malawi and El Salvador. All of these
except for Papua New Guinea maintain official ties with Taipei.
</P>
<P>
The 32 countries opposing the proposal were mainland China, Laos,
Iraq, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Nepal, Argentina, Kuwait, Afghanistan,
Bangladesh, Tanzania, Sri Lanka, Sudan, the Bahamas, Mongolia,
Colombia, Libya, Pakistan, Burma, Iran, Syria, Russia, Cuba, Italy,
Egypt, Cyprus, Zambia, Brazil, Belarus, Mexico and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Though fewer nations spoke either for or against the proposal
this year than last, Chen stressed that the count is less important
than countries coming to understand the "unfair" treatment the ROC is
receiving. When countries better understand the situation, he said,
the ROC government will solicit their support.
</P>
<P>
Noting that not all of the 30 countries that have ties with
Taipei have chances to speak in favor of the ROC at the meeting, Chen
said that after this session of the United Nations concludes, there
will be an overall review of the government's approach to this
matter.
</P>
<P>
He said that joining the United Nations will be a long-term
effort, and that justice will be eventually upheld as long as the
government persists in doing "the right thing."
</P>
<P>
He said that the ROC's UN bid is based on consideration of the
best interests of the nation and international community, and the
wishes of the people in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He cited a recent public poll commissioned by the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs that said over 90 percent of the public supports the
government continuing its effort to rejoin the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Chen did not deny that the government has encountered
difficulties in the past five years, but he said he believes that as
long as there is persistent effort, more nations will support the
ROC's stance.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government has adjusted its approach to
rejoining the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that in the past four years ROC's allies had asked the
United Nations to set up a special task force to examine the special
situation of the ROC. This year, however, the allies went directly to
the crux of the matter by pointing out that UN Resolution No. 2758,
which excluded the ROC from the world body, is an anachronism and
"unfair" to the 21.5 million people on the island, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wu Tzu-dan, director of the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Office in New York and the official in charge of pushing
for the ROC's bid to enter the United Nations, said that the ROC will
continue its efforts to seek substantial progress in its bid.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that from the speeches of the allies, it could be
detected that the world has gained more understanding of the
cross-strait problem and of the wishes of the 21.5 million people on
Taiwan. He said another sign of progress is that for the first time
in five years a country that maintains no official ties with Taipei
has spoken in support of the ROC, referring to Papua New Guinea.
</P>
<P>
Wu echoed Chen's words by saying that joining the United Nations
is a long-term goal. The present task is to let more nations
understand the cross-strait relationship and that it is "unreasonable
and unjust" to deny ROC's representation, he said.

HK ACTIVISTS CONTINUE MISSION TO CLAIM TIAOYUTAIS

<TEXT>
<P>
A group of Hong Kong activists sailing
for the disputed Tiaoyutai islands were forced to drop anchor at sea
off mainland China's Dongshan island off the coast of Fujian province
early Thursday because of mechanical problems.
</P>
<P>
Hwang Wei-ming, spokesman for the Action Committee for Defending
the Tiaoyutais, said that as the activists encountered stormy weather
Wednesday night, causing some of the eight members on board to become
seasick, they could use the time to take a rest, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Bao Diao Ho" (Protect the Tiaoyutais Boat) was expected to
continue the trip to the disputed islands later in the day, Hwang
said, adding that despite the incident, the boat will approach the
uninhabited chain of islets on Saturday as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The protest boat has already made contact with Taiwan activist
Chin Chieh-shou, a Taipei County councilor, who has promised to
provide assistance when necessary, Hwang said.
</P>
<P>
The mission is to protest against Japan's claim to the
archipelago and to mark the death of Hong Kong activist David Chan,
who led a group of protesters in an attempt to land on one of the
islands on September 26, 1996. He drowned after jumping into the sea
when his ship was engaged in a stand-off with Japanese patrol boats
protecting the islands.
</P>
<P>
Hwang said that the group of protesters left late on Tuesday
without prior announcement to prevent Japanese vessels from driving
them away. Although the latest attempt to land on the islands was
made public by the Hong Kong media, the activists are determined to
carry on with the mission.
</P>
<P>
Once the boat is close to the disputed islands, three or four of
the activists will lower a speedboat in an attempt to land. They hope
to bring a picture of Chan to the islands and inscribe a rock with
some words to commemorate his death, Hwang said.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over the islands, claimed by Japan, Taiwan and
mainland China, has heightened since July, 1997, when a makeshift
lighthouse was erected by Japanese right-wingers.

CPC Explosion Reveals Inefficiency, Carelessness
</P>
<P>
The deadly explosion resulting from a gas leak in Kaohsiung Last
Saturday has aroused public concern about the transmission of
petroleum. Many people are questioning what state-run Chinese
Petroleum Corporation does to keep its operations safe for the
public.
</P>
<P>
The horrible explosion in Kaohsiung, in which five were killed
and 24 injured, occurred when workers from the CPC were replacing an
old pipeline. It has been found that carelessness was the main reason
for the incident. The explosion would not have occurred if the
officials and workers replacing the pipeline had cleared the gas
entirely before doing the job.
</P>
<P>
Mistakes by the (CPC) company, however, have been the cause of
quite a few series accidents.
</P>
<P>
The accidents involving the CPC, in addition, also bring to light
the inefficiency of state-run enterprises and, moreover, the
incompetence of the government bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
The gas leak explosion in Kaohsiung has resulted in some public
functionaries receiving penalties. To ensure state-run enterprises
are better organized, the government should make further efforts to
examine operations at these firms and make all the necessary reforms.
We hope that the explosion in Kaohsiung has made clear the urgency of
this task.

TAIWAN ATTRACTS MORE FOREIGN INVESTMENT

A total of 415 foreign investment projects
with a combined value of US$2.95 billion were approved in the first
eight months of the year, the Ministry of Economic Affairs reported
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The figures represent a 34 percent growth in the number of
approved projects, or a 128 percent jump in value from the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
In August alone, the ministry approved 66 foreign investment
projects with a combined value of US$350 million.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the huge rise in foreign investment to
Taiwan's economic recovery and the current stable investment
environment, adding that Taiwan's high-tech industry is the biggest
attraction for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The three leading sectors that attracted the most foreign
investment were: electronic products; basic metal and metal products;
and the service industry.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a total of 449 overseas investment projects with a
combined value of US$1.92 million was approved during the eight-month
period, up 40 percent in the number of approved projects, or 43.8
percent in terms of value, from the year-earlier level.
</P>
<P>
In August alone, the ministry approved a total of 57 overseas
investment projects with an overall value of US$261 million.
</P>
<P>
This investment mainly went into financial insurance, electronic

Taiwan in August approved 54 indirect
investment projects in mainland China with a total value of US$167.97
million, bringing the total number of ROC investment projects in
mainland China this year to 366, and the value to US$931.69 million,
a growth of 2.4 percent, according to statistics released by the ROC
Ministry of Economic Affairs on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the surge in mainland investment to the
relaxation in May of rules governing firms investing on the other
side of the Taiwan Strait and an amnesty for businessmen who had
previously invested in mainland China without prior ROC government
approval.
</P>
<P>
The statistics show that electrical appliances, non-metal product
manufacture, textiles, foodstuffs and beverages are the most common
categories for Taiwan investment and that the provinces of Jiangsu,
Guangdong, Zhejiang, Hebei and Fujian were the places most favored by
Taiwan investors.

</P>
<P>
President Lee, accompanied by an entourage of more than 200
government officials and business leaders, embarked on Sept. 4 on his
trip which took him to Panama, Honduras and El Salvador in Central
America and Paraguay in South America.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed "Taiping (peace) Travel," the trip provided opportunities
for Lee to meet with heads of states and officials in Latin America
to exchange views on ways to strengthen diplomatic and economic
bilateral relations with these countries.
</P>
<P>
While attending the World Congress on the Panama Canal, Lee said
the ROC is willing to help Panama modernize the operation of the
50-mile-long canal after its handover to Panama from the United
States at the end of 1999. The ROC will actively take part in global
affairs and should shoulder its responsibilities as a member of the
international community, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in El Salvador, Lee attended a summit meeting
with the heads of state of El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala,
Honduras and Nicaragua as well the prime minister of Belize, on the
development of Central America. These countries also invited the ROC
to join their European Union-like regional grouping -- the System of
Central American Integration known by its Spanish acronym of SICA.
</P>
<P>
By attending the summit, Lee became the first ROC president to
take part in an international summit in the 86-year history of the
ROC.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Lee also signed many economic, trade,
agricultural and technological cooperation agreements with the ROC's
allies in Latin America to further cement the already close ties.

PRESIDENT LEE COMPLETES SIXTH OVERSEAS TRIP (II)
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  18  (CNA)
(By H.C.M.)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lee advocates that the ROC should break the diplomatic blockade
imposed by Beijing in its attempt to isolate the country from the
international community. He believes that the president himself
should go out to show the world that the ROC has been a sovereign
state since 1912, not a province of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Since becoming president in 1988, Lee has made six overseas trips
to spread his message that the ROC exists and is developing
successfully. His first such trip was to Singapore in March of 1989,
about one year after he succeeded President Chiang Ching-kuo as the
new head of state. This "discovery trip" set a new model for Taiwan's
policy of pragmatic diplomacy with countries with which it does not
have official ties.
</P>
<P>
In February, 1994, Lee embarked on an "ice-breaking trip" to the
Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand, none of which have official
relations with the ROC. This trip changed the "no contact for fear of
angering Beijing policy" of countries in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Three months later, Lee headed a delegation on a
"trans-continental" trip to Nicaragua, Costa Rica, South Africa and
Swaziland, with stopovers in Hawaii and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
In April, 1995, the president visited the Middle East. During
the trip, he met with leaders of Jordan and the United Arab Emirates,
but was unable to visit Israel, a country originally listed in his
itinerary.
</P>
<P>
Lee's fifth overseas trip was to the United States in June, 1995
to visit his alma mater, Cornell University, for a class reunion. A
speech, entitled "All in My Heart," which he delivered at the
university, was broadcast live by CNN. Lee was the first ROC
president to visit the United States since Washington switched
diplomatic relations from Taipei to Beijing in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Lee's overseas trips have achieved great success in promoting the
cause of the ROC to the rest of the world. These visits show that the
ROC has many friends and that it does not stand alone under the
shadow of the PRC.
</P>
<P>
His trips have won high praise from several quarters. Prof. Kau
Ying-mao at Brown University in Providence, R.I., said Lee's visit to
Latin America shows that there is still room for the ROC on the world
stage, despite Beijing's attempts at sabotage.
</P>
<P>
He especially praised Lee's participation in the Central American
summit meeting, suggesting that this model should be expanded to
other regions in the world.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Huang Kuo-chang, an overseas Chinese leader and also a
scholar in the United States, said Lee's participation in the World
Congress on the Panama Canal and the Central American summit indicate
that the economic development and political progress of the ROC have
won worldwide recognition.
</P>
<P>
He also said the presidential visits abroad are very helpful in
promoting diplomatic, economic and trade ties with other countries.

ROC GOVERNMENT TO ESTABLISH MILLENNIUM BUG TASK FORCE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei  Sept.  19 (CNA)
(By Lawrence Chu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With problems from the year 2000 software
glitch looming, the government issued a draft on Thursday to
establish a task force to oversee efforts to head off potential
crisis resulting from the so-called "millennium bug."
</P>
<P>
The task force -- to be established soon by the Executive Yuan --
will be made up of officials from the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA); Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
(DGBAS); ROC Information Software Association; and Institute of the
Information Industry; and the Cabinet's Research, Development and
Evaluation Commission.
</P>
<P>
"The year 2000 crisis seems like it would be very simple to
solve, but unfortunately it is not," said Huang Feng-chuan, who is to
head the group.
</P>
<P>
Huang explained that until very recently all computer programs
used only the last two digits of the year when referring to any
particular date. For example, the year 1997 is represented as a
simple "97" in computer programs and computer-generated receipts,
among other things.
</P>
<P>
The problem with this is that when the next millennium begins,
computers, if uncorrected, will see the date as 1900 instead of 2000.
</P>
<P>
"In case we don't take any step to avert it, this sort of
software crisis will loom up," said Huang.
</P>
<P>
The plan will be given priority financing in the next fiscal
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
All government-related offices should have their programs
containing dates completely updated by the end of 1998 and their
system programs fixed by July 1999.
</P>
<P>
Years with only two digits recorded, according to the western
calendar, should be changed to four digits, and years based on the
Chinese Lunar year will be changed to have three digits.
</P>
<P>
The MOEA and DGBAS will sponsor a series of activities and
seminars to promote public awareness of the potential crisis and
provide assistance to private organizations. Plans for all these
activities should be finished by the end of this year, Huang said.

TAIWAN'S EXPORTS TO US BOOMING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Sept. 18 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's exports to the United States
recorded an annual increase of 7.4 percent in the first seven months
of this year, the US Department of Commerce said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the Department of Commerce showed that
Taiwan's exports to the United States in January-July period totaled
US$18 billion, a record high for the period.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan exports to the United States grew only 3.2 percent last
year, far behind Singapore's 9.6 percent, to rank second among the
four Asian dragons.
</P>
<P>
But Taiwan exports seemed to pick up momentum this year, taking
advantage of the continued growth of the US economy. Taiwan's exports
to the United States have been brisk, while Hong Kong, South Korea
and Singapore all registered negative growth in the same period.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said that Taiwan is the seventh largest
source of US imports, next only to Japan and mainland China in Asia.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Taiwan is also the seventh export market for
US products and the third largest buyer of them in Asia, behind only
Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan imported US$11.27 billion in products from the United
States in the first seven months of this year, up 5.2 percent from
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade between Taiwan and the United States totaled
US$29.28 billion in the first seven months, up 6.5 percent from last
year. Taiwan is still the seventh largest trading partner of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, mainland China, after taking over Hong Kong, has
become the fourth largest trading partner of the United States,
surpassing Britain and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Mainland China was the sixth largest trading partner of the
United States in the first half of the year. But with the addition of
Hong Kong's trade after the former British colony reverted to
Beijing's rule on July 1, mainland China became the fourth largest
partner of the United States, trailing only Canada, Japan and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Commerce said that in the first seven months of
this year, bilateral trade between the United States and mainland
China reached US$39.69 billion, up 20.8 percent from the same period
last year and setting a new high in the January-July period.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade between the United States and Hong Kong reached
US$14.05 billion in the first seven months of 1997, up 6.2 percent
from the same period last year. That figure combined with mainland
China's trade with the United States totals US$53.74 billion.
</P>
<P>
Trade analysts estimate that if mainland exports to the United
States continue their high growth, mainland China (excluding Hong
Kong) will surpass Britain to become the fourth largest trading
partner of the United States by the year's end.
</P>
<P>
Although mainland products made massive inroads into the United
States, US exports to mainland China recorded only modest growth,
making the already large trade surplus in mainland China's favor more
severe.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the United States suffered a trade deficit
of US$4.77 billion with mainland China in July, the highest single
month figure since last October. In the first seven months of this
year, the United States accumulated a trade deficit of US$25.89
billion with mainland China, up 32.5 percent from the same period
last year and also a record high.

UNEMPLOYMENT IS NO. 1 PROBLEM FOR AUSSIE ECONOMY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Canberra,  Sept.  19  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With inflation low, unemployment is
emerging as the number one problem for Australia's economy, according
to Governor Ian Macfarlane of the Reserve Bank of Australia.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at a business meeting in Tokyo Thursday night,
Macfarlane said inflation, measured by the Consumer Price Index, is
under control below 2 percent. But he singled out unemployment as
Australia's main economic problem.
</P>
<P>
Australia's unemployment rate is hovering at 8.7 percent with
about 900,000 people unemployed.
</P>
<P>
But Macfarlane gave a favorable assessment of Australia's
economic performance over the past six years.
</P>
<P>
He said it was no longer necessary as it had been in the 1980s
for Australian treasurers and central bank governors to come to Tokyo
and reassure nervous Japanese investors.
</P>
<P>
"The economy has grown by over 3.5 percent per annum over the
past six years with an inflation rate of 2.25 percent. This is very
good performance by comparison with our peers around the world," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We have not been good at providing jobs for low-skilled people
and those with little experience. We have to examine all avenues on
how to bring these people back into employment," he added.
</P>
<P>
While explaining the unemployment problem in Australia,
Macfarlane downplayed concerns about the recent weakness in the
Australian currency and the turmoil in the troubled Southeast Asian
economies as a result of recent falls in currencies of Thailand,
Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
He said risks posed by the financial turmoil in Southeast Asia
had been exaggerated and the fall in currencies could bring long-term
benefits.
</P>
<P>
He said the word crisis had been used "rather freely" in
describing the recent currency and share market sell-offs in
Southeast Asia, carrying implications that these were disastrous.
</P>
<P>
Macfarlane said Australia's currency depreciation in 1985 and
1986 had been larger and had brought benefits.
</P>
<P>
"We look back on that as an important adjustment. It all owed us
to perform much better in the following decade. Of course there was
an element of overshooting involved in our experience and there is
bound to be this time in Asia, in fact there may already have been an
element of overshooting," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I am still an optimist when we look to the future of those
countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said a key factor behind the currency sell-offs was that the
ASEAN currencies were effectively fixed to the US dollar.
</P>
<P>
"With the US dollar rising against all other currencies over the
past year by a substantial amount, a serious loss of competitiveness
was in store for any country that fixed (its currency) to the US
dollar," Macfarlane said.
</P>
<P>
"There were thus very good economic grounds for some depreciation
of the ASEAN currencies against the US dollar. In a floating rate
system, this can occur relatively smoothly. The Australian dollar has
depreciated against the US dollar over the past nine months while
being quite stable in trade-weighted terms. But in a fixed exchange
rate regime, a depreciation, no matter how economically logical, is
always traumatic," he said.

BLUEPRINT FOR PROVINCIAL GOV'T STREAMLINING TO BE FINALIZED BY 1998
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  19  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A blueprint for streamlining the Taiwan
Provincial Government will be finalized by the end of 1998 when the
four-year tenure of the current governor expires, Premier Vincent
Siew said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions at a Legislative Yuan plenary session, Siew
said the planned streamlining of the provincial government is aimed
at cutting red tape and upgrading administrative efficiency.
</P>
<P>
"We'll draw up a comprehensive plan for restructuring the
provincial government in accordance with the newly passed package of
constitutional amendments," Siew said, adding the blueprint is
expected to be completed by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
If all goes smoothly, Siew said, the restructuring plan will be
implemented starting in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Siew said the Executive Yuan has set up an ad hoc committee to
map out a detailed plan for adjustment of the provincial government's
structure and functions.
</P>
<P>
The committee comprises six divisions, which will be in charge of
adjusting the provincial government's functions and personnel,
adjusting its relations with county and township governments,
protecting the rights and interests of provincial government
employees, establishing vocational training programs for provincial
employees intending to change jobs, adjusting provincial government
assets and property, and privatizing provincial enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"From these operational panels, we can understand the committee's
working directions," Siew said, adding that the committee will hold
its first meeting in the near future, after which the committee will
meet once every month to draft restructuring guidelines.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Siew said, the Cabinet-level Research, Development
and Evaluation Commission is also working on a blueprint for
streamlining the Central Government with a view to upgrading
administrative efficiency and overall national competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
According to a package of constitutional amendments adopted in
July, all provincial-level elections will be suspended after the
tenures of the incumbent Taiwan governor and the Taiwan Provincial
Assembly expire at the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
Under the new provision, the provincial assembly will be replaced
by an advisory commission while the provincial governor will be
appointed by the Central Government.

US GRAND JURY TO HEAR EVIDENCE ON 'TRADE SECRETS THEFT' CASE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Sept.  18 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A US federal magistrate in Cleveland
ruled Wednesday that the government can move forward against two
Taiwan business people accused of stealing trade secrets from a US
company, according to local news report.
</P>
<P>
The Beacon Journal, a Cleveland-based daily, reported that
Magistrate David S. Perelman found "probable cause" for the
government's charges of mail and wire fraud against Yang Pin-yen and
his daughter, Yang Hwei-chen.
</P>
<P>
Perelman deferred ruling on the government's allegations of theft
of trade secrets. "Those charges were more complicated," Yang
Pin-yen's attorney Patrick McLaughlin told the Beacon Journal.
</P>
<P>
Yang Pin-yen, 70, is the chairman of one of the largest
self-adhesive products company in Taiwan, Four Pillars Enterprise Co.
Ltd.. His daughter is the program manager with the research and
development department of the company.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Justice alleges that the Yangs paid US$140,000
to US$150,000 to Lee Ten-hong, a scientist from Taiwan employed by
Avery Dennison Corp. since 1986, to steal patents, confidential
business plans and chemical processes from the company.
</P>
<P>
Avery Dennison, based in Pasadena, California, is a worldwide
leader in the pressure-sensitive label business with US$3.2 billion
in sales. Four Pillars and Avery are competitors.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Yangs were granted bail of US$500,000 each. They
were released from custody Wednesday afternoon after they presented a
lease for a downtown Cleveland apartment where they will be staying
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
Yang Pin-yen and his daughter will wear electronic monitoring
devices around their ankles and can leave the apartment to shop, seek
medical attention or meet with family and attorneys.
</P>
<P>
Avery Dennison has filed a separate civil case against the Yangs,
Four Pillars Enterprise Co. Ltd. and Lee Ten-hong. The pre-trial
hearing of the civil case will be held on Sept. 25 at the same
Eastern District Court of Ohio in Cleveland.

INDONESIA CUTS IMPORT DUTIES ON RAW MATERIALS

<TEXT>
<P>
Indonesia's Ministry of Finance has cut
import tariffs on 153 raw materials and intermediary products by five
to 10 percentage points as a follow-up step to boost exports and
revive the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad said the new tariff cut became
effective on Sept. 17.
</P>
<P>
The cut will automatically reduce the country's weighted average
tariff level from 11.9 percent, which had been in place since July 4,
to 11.76 percent.
</P>
<P>
Agus Haryanto, head of the ministry's legal and public relations
bureau, said the latest tariff cut was made ahead of the original
schedule due to the currency turmoil.
</P>
<P>
"This import tariff cut will encourage export-oriented industries
to produce and export more and strengthen our national economy," Agus
was quoted by the Jakarta Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 153 items include 40 textile and textile-related products, 67
wood products, 31 petrochemical products and nine leather products.
</P>
<P>
Products affected by the cut include peanuts, whose tariff was
cut from 20 percent to 10 percent; tire cord, from 20 percent to 15
percent; and dinatrium sulfate and acetylene, from 15 percent to 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
Tariffs on polyester, staple fiber, rayon viscose, veneer and
processed leather were cut from 10 percent to 5 percent, while
tariffs on unwoven textiles and sawn logs were reduced from 10
percent to zero, and those on soybeans and soybean oil were cut from
5 percent to zero.

CAL, CA TO SHARE CARRIER CODES

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei-based China Airlines (CAL) and
Continental Airlines (CA) of the United States will jointly operate
the Taipei-San Francisco-Houston direct flight route under a
"code-sharing system" from Saturday on.
</P>
<P>
A CAL spokesman explained here on Friday that with code-sharing
-- by which CAL and CA will be able to use each other's planes'
carrier codes -- his company can provide more convenient flight
services to Houston for CAL passengers.
</P>
<P>
CAL carriers now fly every day between Taipei and San Francisco,
the spokesman said, adding that as soon as the code-sharing operation
starts, CAL passengers from Taipei can directly board CA planes in
San Francisco bound for Houston without having to check-in again.
</P>
<P>
Since CAL and CA forged cooperative ties last June, the two
carriers have provided such services as one-ticket Taipei-Houston
flights, mileage advantages to their customers on this route and
direct package transportation.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that with the inauguration of the
code-sharing system, CAL and CA customers will enjoy more services,
including those related to the resolution of flight disputes.
</P>
<P>
The code-sharing system was approved by the governments in Taipei
and Washington in their signing of an "Open-Skies" accord in late
February. Under the free market aviation pact, airlines of the two
countries are allowed to operate an unlimited number of both
passenger and cargo flights to any destination in each other's
territory.

GORE'S IMAGE HURT BY CAMPAIGN FINANCING SCANDAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
New  York, Sept. 18 (CNA)
(By David Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After nearly one year of tumult over US
President Bill Clinton's 1996 fund-raising practices, the initial
returns show that it is the vice president, not President Clinton,
who is suffering the public-relations damage, according to a new Wall
Street Journal/NBC News poll.
</P>
<P>
While President Clinton keeps riding high, the poll shows Vice
President Gore receiving his lowest positive ratings and the highest
negative ratings of his tenure in office. Just 38 percent of
Americans now express positive feelings about Gore, down from 49
percent in July. And 33 percent express negative feelings, up from 25
percent two months ago.
</P>
<P>
The Journal/NBC survey suggests that the vice president's
political travails are no laughing matter. As troublesome as Gore's
drop in his overall favorability may be his erosion among core party
constituencies. Among Democrats generally, his positive rating has
dropped to 58 percent from 73 percent in July. Among blue-collar
workers, he is down to 36 percent from 49 percent. Among those with
just a high-school education, he has dropped to 35 percent from 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
The fund-raising controversy appears to have especially singed
Gore because most Americans know so much less about him than Clinton,
said Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster who conducted the Journal/NBC
News survey along with Republican Robert Teeter. As a result,
fund-raising revelations loom much larger in his public image.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Gore's longstanding reputation for personal
integrity means "he's probably held to a higher standard," Hart said.
And the nature of the controversy, involving phone calls placed from
his White House office, is far easier for average voters to
understand than more arcane disputes over other campaign-finance
issues.
</P>
<P>
The poll was based on nationwide telephone interviews of 2,004
adults, conducted Thursday to Monday by the polling organizations of
Hart and Teeter. The data's margin of error is plus or minus 2.2
percentage points, except for half-sample questions, which have
slightly larger margins.

TAIWAN RANKS 3RD IN M'LAND MARKET
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Canberra,  Sept. 19 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's market share in mainland China
ranked third in 1995, trailing only that of Japan and the United
States, according to the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the World Bank report Friday, the mass circulation
newspaper The Australian reported that Japan had the biggest market
share in mainland China, with its exports accounting for 22 percent,
followed by the US share of 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's market share in mainland China was 11 percent in 1995,
according to the World Bank survey.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's market share in mainland China ranked fourth with 8
percent; followed by Hong Kong, 7 percent; Germany, 6 percent;
Singapore, 3 percent; and with other countries accounting for 31
percent.
</P>
<P>
On the export side, Hong Kong led others with importing 24
percent of mainland China's total exports; followed by Japan, 19
percent; and the United States, 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
Germany and South Korea were tied in importing mainland products,
with 4 percent each of mainland China's total exports. Taiwan
received only 2 percent of mainland China's total exports.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank report predicts that by the year 2020 mainland
China could be shipping nearly 10 percent of world exports, ahead of
Japan but still behind North America and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The report also forecasts that mainland China will emerge as the
world's second largest trading nation with per capita income surging
to more than US$10,000.
</P>
<P>
But the crucial ingredients to matching the forecasts for
mainland China will be maintaining the pace of reform and ensuring
the rest of the world remains hospitable to its exports, the World
Bank said.

DEBT, CORRUPTION SEEN THREATENING M'LAND CHINA'S ECONOMIC MIRACLE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Canberra,   Sept.  19  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Debt-ridden banks and widespread
corruption threaten mainland China's ambitious goal of becoming the
world's largest economy, according to a World Bank report released in
Hong Kong Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a dispatch from Hong Kong, The Australian Financial Review
quoted the World Bank report as saying that mainland China could by
2020 become "an agile, modern and adaptable economy" or it could fall
apart, the victim of what it dubbed "Sinosclerosis."
</P>
<P>
The same daily, in its editorial headlined "China's next market
leap" on Friday, noted mainland China's economic growth in the past
two decades was fueled by an explosion of annual foreign investment
from US$2 billion in 1987 to almost US$36 billion now.
</P>
<P>
"The big question is whether China can keep this going for
another two decades or so," the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank report notes that progress in mainland China has
been remarkable, especially in the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
"In the 18 years since 1978, agriculture's share of the workhorse
dropped from 71 percent to about 50 percent," the report says,
adding, "It took the United States 50 years and Japan 60 years to
achieve a similar structural fall."
</P>
<P>
But the report warns mainland China's economic miracle has huge
problems with the corrupt, communist-style management of state
companies and banks.
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the problems are the health of mainland China's
304,000 state-owned enterprises, which mainland Chinese President
Jiang Zemin vowed to partially privatize in his opening speech of the
15th Communist Party Congress in Beijing this week.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank paints a bleak picture of mainland China's 304,000
state-owned firms, saying they lag way behind the growing private
economy in output, productivity and employment growth.
</P>
<P>
The firms rarely go into bankruptcy, something that would free up
the capital for more productive uses, both because local party
officials fear rising unemployment and the procedure itself is
time-consuming and costly, the report says.
</P>
<P>
The report says that worse still, Beijing finds it difficult to
supervise this mess, which has provided chances for many managers to
strip assets out of enterprises, leaving the state only with their
huge debts.
</P>
<P>
One 1994 survey quoted by the World Bank found that more than 10
percent of the assets of state enterprises had unaccountably gone
missing.

LEGISLATORS PROPOSE NEW, EVEN STRICTER, ANTI-SMOKING BILL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  19  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three Taiwan legislators have jointly
introduced a motion calling for a complete ban on sales of cigarettes
containing nicotine from 2009, in connection with Friday's
implementation of tough new "tobacco-damage prevention" or
anti-smoking legislation.
</P>
<P>
The three lawmakers -- Tsai Cheng-yang (New Party-Taipei County),
Hsieh Chin-chung (KMT-Taipei City) and Chen Chi-mai (DPP-Kaohsiung
City) -- told a joint news conference that their proposal has won the
support of more than 100 legislators from both the ruling and
opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
The motion calls for adding an article to the newly implemented
anti-smoking law which will totally ban the manufacture, import and
sales of nicotine-containing tobacco products from Jan. 1, 2009.
</P>
<P>
The draft amendment bill will also include penalties for
violators of the ban, Tsai said at the news conference. According to
the draft bill, violators will be fined NT$1 million (US$35,088) to
NT$10 million (US$350,877). Fines will be doubled if the violator
fails to recall the prohibited goods from the market within a
specified period of time.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said the motion is aimed mainly at preventing American
cigarette makers from dumping tobacco products containing nicotine in
Taiwan and other Asian countries in 12 years' time.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement reached in June between major American
tobacco makers and prosecution authorities in 40 US states, America
will completely ban sales of tobacco products containing nicotine
from 2009.
</P>
<P>
Lin Ching-li, a department chief with the non-profit private John
Tung Foundation, hailed the introduction of the motion, saying the
bill, if adopted, will help create a smoke-free society here.
</P>
<P>
Lin quoted estimates by authoritative health authorities as
showing that five million people around the world will die from
tobacco-related injury by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 450 public health officials were mobilized
around the island on Friday to advise local smokers not to smoke in
public places, as the country's first anti-smoking law took effect.
</P>
<P>
"No smoking" stickers or posters were seen in many public places,
including airport terminals, railway stations, hospitals, hotel
lobbies and government buildings.
</P>
<P>
Although some people were seen flaunting the new rules, no fines
were being issued, prompting some private anti-smoking organizations
to blast the Department of Health for failing to have prepared blank
fine sheets and for failing to ensure sufficient publicity for the
new law over the past six months.

ROUND-ISLAND ANTI-NUCLEAR WALK TO BE HELD
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 19 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Taiwan anti-nuclear group is to hold an
around-the-island protest walk to publicize their anti-nuclear
ideals.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the group, which wants a national referendum on
the fourth nuclear power plant project, said on Friday that his
organization will start the planned 36-day walk in downtown Taipei on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Participants plan to walk from there through Taoyuan, Hsinchu,
Miaoli, Taichung, Changhua, Nantou, Yunlin, Chiayi, Tainan,
Kaohsiung, Taitung, Hualien, Ilan and Keelung, returning to the
capital city on Oct. 26, where they will join in a huge anti-nuclear
demonstration, he said.
</P>
<P>
The walk is part of a campaign aimed at promoting islandwide
support for the initiation of a large-scale public referendum on
whether work by the Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) on the island's
fourth nuclear power plant in Kungliao, Taipei County, should be
allowed to continue, the activist said.
</P>
<P>
He noted they will also promote their concepts of building a
living environment without nuclear threat, in the hope of enlisting
nationwide support for their cause.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the plant has lagged far behind its original
schedule because of strong opposition from Kungliao residents and
local environmentalists. Taipower has warned that massive investment
in the plant will be wasted and power shortages in Taiwan will be
exacerbated if the construction project is suspended.
</P>
<P>
There are already two nuclear power plants on the outskirts of
Taipei, with a third located in Pintung County, southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Protests over the fourth nuclear plant project broke out in the
mid-1980s after its proposal, prompted in part by fears generated by
the 1986 Chernobyl accident and in part by operational flaws at the
three existing power plants.

BUSINESSMEN AGAIN URGED TO EXERCISE RESTRAINT IN M'LAND INVESTMENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  19  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan businessmen should continue to
exercise restraint against too hasty investment in mainland China,
Chang King-yuh, chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chang made the remarks at the Legislative Yuan in response to a
question by Legislator Lin Chien-jung of the ruling Kuomintang, who
asked about the restraint policy President Lee Teng-hui began
espousing last August.
</P>
<P>
Lin noted that Taiwan businessmen have exercised restraint over
the past year since the government put the brakes on their rush to
invest in mainland China. But he asked whether the government
shouldn't review this policy now that Hong Kong has reverted to
Beijing's rule and UN reports have said mainland China is the
"favorite destination" of multi-national enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Chang said Taiwan's policy toward mainland China, based on the
premise of safety and dignity, has always been to create a win-win
situation, especially as both sides of the Taiwan Strait are now
seeking membership in the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
But with Beijing making relentless efforts to stifle the ROC's
presence internationally and cross-strait dialogue yet to resume, the
policy of restraint must still hold, Chang said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that one fourth of Taiwan's total exports went to mainland
China and that the island's investment in mainland China is second
only to that of Hong Kong, he expressed the hope that Taiwan
businessmen will diversify their investments.
</P>
<P>
He said that if Taiwan businessmen build up their economic might
elsewhere, when the time comes for cross-strait talks there will be a
win-win situation on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.

DEAL WITH PARAGUAY OVER FIGHTER PLANES HINGES ON GOVERNMENT POLICY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 19 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of National Defense will act
in accordance with government policy in providing F-5Es to Paraguay,
ministry spokesman Kung Fan-ting said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kung was responding to reports that the Republic of China will
sell or donate 12 aging F-5Es to the South American country to help
cement ties between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
Kung said that although Paraguay has been negotiating with the
ROC over the fighter planes, the time for such a deal is not "ripe."
</P>
<P>
As Taiwan will phase out the aging F-5Es after the arrival of
second-generation planes, the deal will not undermine the combat
readiness of the air force, Kung said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's air force has 250 US-made F-5Es as its backbone, but is
considering retiring half of them before the turn of the century
after 150 F-16s and 60 Mirage 2000-5s ordered from the United States
and France, respectively, are put into service.
</P>
<P>
The military official said that Paraguayan President Juan Carlos
Wasmosy discussed the fighter deal with President Lee Teng-hui when
he visited Taiwan in Aug. 1995. But as the F-5Es still played a major
role in Taiwan's air defense at that time, the government could not
give the South American leader a positive response then, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kung said he didn't know if Lee had discussed the issue with
Wasmosy during the Paraguay portion of his four-nation Latin American
visit.
</P>
<P>
Though the ministry has yet to receive instructions over the
matter from the Presidential Office or the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, it will act accordance with government policy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Any such deal would still have to get the green light from the
United States, which sold the fighter planes to Taiwan, he noted.

DPP URGED TO FORMULATE NEW POLICY TOWARD BEIJING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  19  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) must formulate a new policy toward rival communist
China, a party elder said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
DPP Secretary-General Chiu Yi-jen made the call in his private
capacity at a public hearing on how to end hostility between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said the DPP's China policy, which rejects any forms of
negotiations with communist China, has become unrealistic due
to significant changes in the general international situation.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan can no longer resist strong pressure from the United
States and communist China to hold political negotiations with
Beijing," Chiu said, adding that the United States is particularly
intolerant of letting cross-strait tension affect its national
interests.
</P>
<P>
Against this background, Chiu said, the DPP, Taiwan's largest
opposition party, should formulate a new China policy to cope with
the changing situation.
</P>
<P>
Chiu admitted that the pro-independence DPP has yet to forge an
intraparty consensus on the formulation of a new policy toward
communist China.
</P>
<P>
According to Chiu, DPP heavyweights remain divided on how to
deal with communist China.
</P>
<P>
For instance, DPP Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang calls for bold steps
to engage with mainland China. Chiu himself, however, prefers to
start negotiations with mainland China as late as possible so that
Taiwan will have more time to reinforce its economic strength and
defense capabilities as well as to forge a national consensus on
cross-strait ties.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same public hearing sponsored by DPP Legislator
Tsai Ming-hsien, Vice Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Wu An-chia
said the greatest obstacle to negotiating with mainland China at the
moment is Beijing's hegemonic mentality.
</P>
<P>
Unless mainland China drops its bullying mentality, treats Taiwan
as an equal political entity and stops squeezing Taiwan's
international space, Wu said, cross-strait political negotiations
are not expected to start soon.

LOCAL PRESS COMMENTS ON DIALOGUE WITH BEIJING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  19  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The following are excerpts from an
editorial carried in Friday's edition of local English-language daily
the China News.
</P>
<P>
It's Time to Restart Talks
</P>
<P>
It is time to put an end to... silence (between Taipei and
Beijing), and restart cross-strait talks...
</P>
<P>
The political environment for such talks has been set for many
months, with both Beijing and Taipei at least talking about the
possibility (although still bickering over semantics) of sitting down
at the table once again.
</P>
<P>
Since talks broke down in mid-1995, the top leadership in both
Beijing and Taipei have received renewed mandates, and can stake new
claims to power. They have new governments behind them, and they have
new relationships with Hong Kong. It is the same old issues, however,
that await their attention.
</P>
<P>
Licensing and legal issues, as well as solutions to trade
disputes, the repatriation of nationals, travel guarantees, etc.
</P>
<P>
But neither side seems willing to make the minor necessary
concessions it would take to get these talks back on track.
</P>
<P>
Problems continue to exist over the annoyingly ambiguous `one
China' principle, the official level of negotiations, and even the
agenda. Top all this off with Beijing's rabid mistrust of anything
and anyone associated too closely with Lee Teng-hui, and we're stuck
with stalemate.
</P>
<P>
But Taipei is in a position to break some ground, if it should so
choose. With a new premier familiar with cross-strait issues, a
changing of some of the old CCP hard-liner guard in China... the time
doesn't get any more "ripe" for a renewal of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The governments in Taipei and Beijing must put an end to the
unnecessary bickering and damaging accusations. It is time to get
back to the negotiating table and be civil to each other once again.
Surely they can both agree on the immediate need for such talks. At
least that would be something to build on.

MIXED REACTIONS TO PROPOSED TAIWAN ROLE IN SICA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  19  (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The possibility of a role for Taiwan in
the System of Central American Integration (SICA), the Latin American
version of the European Union (EU), has drawn concern from government
officials, lawmakers and scholars here, who are divided on whether a
Taiwan membership in SICA will be in the best interests of the island
in the political and economic arenas.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state of El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala,
Honduras and Nicaragua, together with the Belize premier, jointly
invited Taiwan to join the regional integration body during ROC
President Lee Teng-hui's visit to the region which ended earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
At a public hearing at the legislature on Friday, Vice Foreign
Minister H.L. Ou said that SICA is the most important regional
organization in Central America, with the aim of promoting political,
social and economic development, as well as protecting the
environment and human rights.
</P>
<P>
He said that membership of SICA will not only help increase
Taiwan's political and economic clout, it will also profit Taiwan
investors in the region.
</P>
<P>
Ou said that past Taiwan investment in many parts of the world,
especially Southeast Asia, has failed to earn the island the
hoped-for "fair" political support from the host countries.
</P>
<P>
But this is not the case in Central America, since many countries
in the region have rendered their diplomatic support for the ROC in
addition to maintaining bilateral economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan's SICA membership will be the biggest diplomatic
breakthrough for the island so far and will be in the best interest
of the nation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Director Chien Shih-hsiung of the Small and Medium
Business Administration said Taiwan's SICA role will produce a
"positive effect" on Taiwan investment in Central America and will
also help Taiwan investors solve the lingering problems of
technological transfers and seeking financial assistance.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said Central America's existing economic
development is very similar to that of Taiwan in the 1960s and
Taiwan's cooperative programs with countries of the region will help
increase its international stature.
</P>
<P>
However, Professor Wei Yung of National Chiao Tung University,
questioned the wisdom of Taiwan's SICA membership, saying it would be
"too costly" since Taiwan is very likely to be required to shoulder a
major portion of the body's budget.
</P>
<P>
"But the question is, who can guarantee for how much and for how
long Taiwan will be able to win support from other SICA members?" he
asked.
</P>
<P>
Wei did admit that SICA membership would bring about some
short-term profits for Taiwan, but he argued it would be too risky
for the island to concentrate its limited diplomatic resources on a
single region.
</P>
<P>
Wei, himself once a lawmaker of the ruling Kuomintang, urged the
Legislative Yuan to have second thoughts about the case before giving
it the green light.
</P>
<P>
Legislators Chen Yi-hsin and Chien Ta of the opposition New Party
said that the proposed SICA membership seems to be beyond Taiwan's
expectation, and whether the country and its investors would benefit
from such a hasty and "passive" international cooperative program is
questionable.

TAIWAN HAS NEVER DENIED `ONE CHINA' PRINCIPLE: KOO
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 19 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's top liaison officer with mainland
China said on Friday that Taiwan has never denied the "one China"
principle, under which it is hoped that the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait will one day be unified.
</P>
<P>
Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF),
said that the current political status of China is
"shared-sovereignty with separate jurisdiction," adding that to
recognize that China is ruled by two political entities doesn't
conflict with the "one China" principle.
</P>
<P>
The SEF is the semi-official organization set up to handle
cross-strait exchanges in the absence of official relations.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the SEF and its mainland counterpart, the Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), argued for months
over the definition of "one China," but the dispute was solved after
they decided to let each side state their own definition of "one
China," a move which proved conducive to the progress of
semi-official talks and cross-strait exchanges, Koo recalled.
</P>
<P>
Koo once again urged Beijing to resume talks with Taiwan,
unilaterally suspended by the mainland in 1995, saying that prior to
any exchange of visits by leaders or senior officials of either side,
talks between the SEF and ARATS should be opened first, to enhance
mutual understanding and trust.

<P>
Premier Vincent Siew urged Beijing on
Friday to reopen channels of dialogue with Taipei, particularly talks
between Koo Chen-fu and Wang Daohan, the two principal negotiators
for Taipei and Beijing, as the first step in starting higher-level
talks across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the interpellation of an opposition legislator at
the Legislative Yuan, Siew called on Beijing to shelve the thorny
issue of sovereignty, to adopt a practical approach to cross-strait
issues and to promote cross-strait exchanges to set the groundwork
for bilateral dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Citing the conclusion of the multi-party National Development
Conference held here at the end of last year which called for
approaching Beijing on the basis of mutual respect and reciprocity,
the premier said he hopes to get ties with Beijing back on track
soon.
</P>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Chang King-yuh pointed
out on the same occasion that mainland China is a vital factor in
Taiwan's bid to become a regional operations hub, but Beijing's
persistent attempts to isolate the island from the international
stage make Taipei inevitably wary about it's own safety in dealing
with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He and Siew make the remarks when addressing Democratic
Progressive Party Legislator Chang Chun-hsiung's concerns that
President Lee Teng-hui's rhetoric against Beijing during his Latin
American trip will strain ties with Beijing, just as there are some
indications of a thaw.

TAIPEI GLAD TO SEE JIANG'S LEADERSHIP STRENGTHENED

<TEXT>
<P>
A Taiwan high-ranking mainland affairs
official said on Friday that Taipei is glad to see that mainland
China's President Jiang Zemin, who is also Communist Party chief, has
strengthened his leadership in a major shake-up following the end of
the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
Lin Choung-pin, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC), said that Jiang scored a big victory in the party congress
over the removal of some of his potential power-challengers or
critics from the 192-member Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
However, Jiang's leadership still faces many challenges and
tests, including structural, economic and social problems. In a word,
the real challenges or pressure are coming from "outside" of Jiang's
government.
</P>
<P>
Lin refused to speculate on whether Beijing will change its
policy toward Taiwan, but he said that Taiwan's mainland policy has
remained the same -- to push for the exchange of visits and
negotiations to develop stable, peaceful cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
Lin urged mainland leaders to be practical and reasonable in
handling relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, adding
that Beijing should soon resume talks with Taiwan which were
unilaterally suspended by the mainland in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The MAC is a cabinet-level body set up to chart Taiwan's mainland
China policy in the absence of official relations.

WTO  URGED  TO  HEED  CASE  FOR TURTLE-SAFE NETS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva, Sept. 19 (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) urged
the Geneva-based World Trade Organization (WTO) not to play "Russian
roulette" with international environmental agreements by ruling
against a US ban on imports of shrimp caught in nets without turtle
exclusion devices.
</P>
<P>
A WTO dispute panel is examining a complaint against the US by
four Asian shrimp-exporters -- India, Malaysia, Pakistan and Thailand
-- that the import ban breaches international trade rules by imposing
US law on other countries. Its final report is due in December,
according to WTO reports on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The case has strong similarities -- and is arousing equally
strong emotions -- to the celebrated tuna-dolphin dispute. That case
sparked a furious response from environmental groups in 1991 when
GATT, the WTO's predecessor, found against a US ban on imported tuna
caught in ways that killed dolphins.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists believe they have a stronger case in the
shrimp-turtle dispute. According to a WWF report published recently,
all five turtle species involved are classified by the United Nations
as threatened with extinction. Shrimp nets used without turtle
exclusion devices drown thousands of turtles annually.
</P>
<P>
The WWF report argued that the US import ban complies with
international environmental law requiring states to protect
endangered species. Turtle exclusion devices -- simple trapdoor
mechanisms that allow turtles to escape from the shrimp trawlers'
nets -- are cheap and effective.

PRESIDENT LEE'S `LEADERSHIP DIPLOMACY' PRAISED
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  19  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A senior official of the opposition
Democratic Progress Party (DPP) said that President Lee Teng-hui's
trip to the ROC's allies in Latin America has made a valuable
contribution to promoting Taiwan's international status.
</P>
<P>
Chiu Yi-jen, DPP secretary general, said the president's
just-concluded trip received mixed comments in Taiwan, but added that
he believes that "leadership diplomacy" will be one of the most
efficient ways to break the diplomatic blockade imposed by mainland
China.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said that if his party ever takes power, it will also push
for this style of diplomacy to help Taiwan assume a greater profile
in the international community.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan should try to maintain diplomatic relations with as many
countries as possible, Chieu said, adding that diplomacy is sure to
cost money, but that Taiwan should differentiate between aid, loans
and investment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a professor at National Chengchi University said that
Lee's 16-day trip was a significant diplomatic accomplishment, for it
helped raise Taiwan's international profile and strengthened the
friendly ties between Taiwan and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-ko, director of the diplomacy department at the
university, said that the president's presence at the World Congress
on the Panama Canal and the summit meeting of six Central American
leaders was accomplishment in itself, adding that Taiwan's entry into
the System of Central American Integration (SICA) will bring Taiwan
numerous business opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Lee went on to say that although some people criticized the fact
that Taiwan used money to strengthen ties with its diplomatic allies,
actually the aid Taiwan offered to its allies was not much, compared
with the aid distributed by South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Taiwan was itself the recipient of foreign aid
during the country's march towards development into a modern country
and now it is time for Taiwan to make its own contribution to the
international community, Lee added.

PRESIDENT LEE PRONOUNCES LATIN AMERICA TRIP A SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  19 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the press conference on his return to
Taipei from a widely-publicized 16-day trip to Latin America on
Friday night, President Lee Teng-hui said his journey, especially his
attendance at the World Congress on the Panama Canal and his summit
with leaders of six Latin American allies, was a success.
</P>
<P>
Lee thanked the United States for granting him a transit visa
enabling him to make overnight stopovers in Hawaii on his way to and
from Latin America.
</P>
<P>
He also said he was considering setting up a special working team
under the Executive Yuan to ensure that the treaties he signed during
his trip were fully carried out.
</P>
<P>
The president disputed critics' attacks that he is conducting
"checkbook diplomacy" by handing out generous financial aid packages
and loans to ROC allies, in exchange for their support for Taipei's
bid to enter the United Nations, saying that all the loans and grants
he delivered to his hosts were the result of negotiations which
started long before his diplomatic excursion.
</P>
<P>
Responding to questions from reporters, Lee acknowledged that
Beijing President Jiang Zemin's status as the Communist Party of
China (CPC)'s paramount leader seemed more solid after the
just-concluded CPC 15th National Congress, but added that the time
for the ROC president to make good his promise to visit Beijing still
depends on the political climate across the Taiwan Strait, pointing
out that there is no sign that Beijing will admit the ROC as an
sovereign state, which is the main prerequisite for his promised
peace-making trip to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
In response to criticism that his visits to Panama and Paraguay,
only to see those two countries keep silent at the United Nations'
Steering Committee on Wednesday when it came to debate Taiwan's bid
to rejoin the world body, Lee asked his critics to wait and see,
saying that he is sure the two countries will argue for the ROC at
the upcoming general assembly.
</P>
<P>
He touted the ROC's participation in the System of Central
American Integration (SICA) as a diplomatic coup which will enable
the free flow of commodities and capital between the ROC and its six
Latin American allies -- Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras,
Guatemala, Nicaragua and Belize.
</P>
<P>
Lee's 16-day trip at the head of a 200-plus entourage of
government officials and business leaders began on Sept. 4 and took
him to Panama, Honduras, El Salvador and Paraguay.

TAIWAN'S FDI INFLOW RANKS 38TH IN THE WORLD

<DATELINE>
Washington,  Sept.  19  (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although Taiwan has been sparing no
effort to attract foreign investment for its project to develop
itself into an Asia-Pacific operations center, it still received less
foreign capital in 1996 than 37 other countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics from the US Department of
Commerce, Taiwan lured around US$1.42 billion in foreign direct
investment (FDI) last year, down 10 percent from the level of a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan, at number 38, is behind the other three "Asian Tigers" --
South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong, all of which have been enjoying
vigorous economic development -- and even lags behind Nigeria, which
attracted some US$1.72 billion in FDI in 1996, more than any other
country in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The statistics show that the 10 Asian areas drawing the most FDI
last year were mainland China, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, India,
Hong Kong, Thailand, South Korea and Vietnam, in that order.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the world's total FDI reached US$349.23 billion, with 60
percent of this amount going to developed countries and the remaining
40 percent to developing nations, the figures showed.
</P>
<P>
The United States represented the largest market for foreign
investment, with by absorbing US$84.63 billion in FDI last year, the
department said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Commerce Department tallies, the United States,
mainland China, Britain, France, Belgium/Luxembourg, Brazil,
Singapore, Indonesia, Mexico and Canada registered the 10 largest
inflows of FDI in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the department also indicated that Taiwan ranked 23rd
in taking FDI from the US, behind Hong Kong and Singapore.

Nearly 60,000 fires broke out in Taiwan
between 1991 and 1996, claiming the lives of many people and causing
a huge amount of damage, a legislator said on Saturday.

WLFD CALLS ON US TO CONTINUE ITS GLOBAL ROLE
</HEADLINE>

(By Bill Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The World League for Freedom and
Democracy (WLFD) Friday concluded its 29th General Assembly here,
calling on the United States to continue its positive role in
preserving the world's peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
The WLFD said in a joint communique that the world's new
challenges are of an economic, educational and environmental nature,
and that achieving mutual understanding among regions and countries
must be emphasized.
</P>
<P>
For the principles of freedom and democracy to prevail, the WLFD
went on, tensions must be eliminated on the Korean peninsula, in
Cambodia, the Middle East, Bosnia-Herzogevina, and parts of Africa
and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
It applauded the United Nations' strong commitment to
peace-keeping initiatives and the humanitarian and environmental
objectives of UN specialized agencies.
</P>
<P>
It called on all nations to actively participate in global
organizations, and said it supports participation by the Republic of
China on Taiwan in those organizations so that it can offer its
economic support and technological expertise to other countries.
Observer status at the United Nations for the ROC would also be
appropriate, it added.
</P>
<P>
It said that respect for sensible environmental standards is
essential, efforts to relieve poverty, starvation and disease must be
stepped up, discrimination against people on the grounds of race, sex
or disability must be eliminated, and food and energy production must
be increased.
</P>
<P>
The assembly adopted two resolutions, one calling on the United
Nations to take urgent measures to provide a climate for peace and
justice in Cambodia and the other urging its members to support the
ROC's participation in international organizations.
</P>
<P>
WLFD President Chao Tze-chi of the ROC thanked the US chapter for
organizing the three-day conference attended by some 100 delegates
from 60 countries.
</P>
<P>
US President Bill Clinton sent a message to the conference
commending the WLFD's efforts to create a brighter future for all
people.
</P>
<P>
"This year's theme, 'Towards a Better and More Secure World,'
exemplifies your commitment to democracy and to building on the
progress we have made toward global peace since the end of the cold
war," Clinton said.

SENATOR'S LOBBY FOR TAIWAN'S MEMBERSHIP IN IMF GAINS STEAM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Sept.  19  (CNA)
(By Pan Ying-chen &amp; Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
US Senator Jesse Helms' lobby for
Taiwan's membership in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the
World Bank is gaining steam, with 18 senators from both parties
signing up as cosponsors of his motion to call for US backing for the
island's bid.
</P>
<P>
Helms, the influential Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, introduced a proposal on May 23 calling for the
US government to back Taiwan's bid to enter the IMF and World Bank,
as well as other "appropriate" regional multilateral economic
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The bill, coauthored by Democratic Senator Joseph Lieberman, has
won 18 senators' support thus far, including five Democrats and 13
Republicans. Noteworthy among them are Chairman of the Banking,
Housing and Urban Affairs Committee Alfonse D'Amato; Chairman of
Energy and Natural Resources Frank Murkowski; and Rick Santorum
(R-Penn.).
</P>
<P>
Helms claimed in his proposal that Taiwan's membership in the IMF
would be helpful both to furthering the goal for which the
international body was founded and to helping the global economy,
especially the economies of those developing countries that need
foreign financial aid.
</P>
<P>
The proposal says that the US Congress believes the government
should help Taiwan gain access to the IMF and World Bank -- which are
nonpolitical bodies that seek to promote international economic
development -- and notes that Taiwan, though it lost its seat at the
United Nations in 1972, remained a member of these organizations
until 1980.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried in the Senate record, Helms asserted that
his proposal intends no challenge to any other country but rather
expresses the sense of the Senate that Taiwan should be given its
due.

DOW WILL BREAK 10,000 IN 1998: MARKET ANALYST
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
New  York, Sept. 19 (CNA)
(By David Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An exuberantly bullish Wall Street guru
predicted Wednesday that the Dow Jones industrial average will hit
10,000 by next year.
</P>
<P>
Addressing some 500 investors, brokers and others in Huntington,
Long Island, Ralph Acampora, chief technical analyst of Prudential
Securities, the fifth biggest US brokerage firm, said his optimism is
rooted in technical analysis.
</P>
<P>
Acampora's claim to fame is that he has been ahead of his time.
In 1995, with the Dow drifting at 4,500, Acampora said it would reach
7,000 by 1998. Now, with the Dow having made it past 8,000 before
retreating a bit, Acampora is calling on his troops to get ready for
10,000 on the Dow by next June.
</P>
<P>
He brushed aside concerns that the recent blue-chip weakness
spelled the end of the bull run, saying investors were wisely
rotating into smaller companies and mainly domestic businesses.
</P>
<P>
"You want a bear market, you'll have one; but I think it's next
year, not this year," he said. "But between now and 10,000, I think
you participate."
</P>
<P>
Even if the market retreats in 1998, Acampora sees a silver
lining. Pointing to the 1949-61 Wall Street rally as a precedent, he
predicted the Dow could reach 18,500 by 2006.

TAIWAN OFFICIALS FORCED TO CANCEL TRIP TO H.K.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two senior Taiwan officials said on
Saturday that they were having to give up on planned trips to Hong
Kong because Beijing had exerted pressure on authorities there to
deny them visas.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank of China Governor Sheu Yuan-dong -- who had been
invited by the Taiwan-based China Trust Commercial Bank (CTCB) to
give a speech at a dinner party its Hong Kong branch will host Sunday
for delegates to a meeting of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
-- canceled the trip after Hong Kong authorities failed to grant him
a visa by Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Calling the delay a snub, Sheu made the announcement Saturday
morning through his office.
</P>
<P>
Also invited to the banquet was Finance Minister Paul Chiu, who
didn't give up on his trip until Saturday afternoon, when the CTCB
informed him that Hong Kong had turned down both his and Sheu's visa
applications without explanation.
</P>
<P>
Chiu lambasted Beijing as the driving force behind the Hong Kong
decision, which, he said, belies mainland China's promise that the
former British colony may keep its capitalist system for another 50
years.
</P>
<P>
The dinner party, slated for Sunday, the eve of the beginning of
the IMF's annual meeting, had been aimed at providing a rare
opportunity for Taiwan financial officials to associate with their
counterparts from other countries and boost the island's bid to enter
the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan, which was supplanted at the IMF in 1980 by mainland
China, is eager to return to the global financial body.
</P>
<P>
Although it has not been unusual for Hong Kong to refuse visas to
senior Taiwan officials, this is the first time it has done so since
coming under Beijing's rule. Moreover, Taiwan financial officials
have never before been prevented by a host country from attending
such occasions on the fringe of IMF meetings.
</P>

The IMF gathering is scheduled to last Sept. 22-25, with mainland
Chinese Premier Li Peng to be the keynote speaker at the opening

the respondents didn't think it would help much.
</P>
<P>
Asked their opinion of Lee's remarks against mainland China
during his trip, 57 percent of the respondents labeled them
"improper," compared with 25 percent who favored the remarks.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 49 percent of those polled said they oppose Taiwan
using money to strengthen its diplomatic ties, while 36 percent said
that economic aid is an effective way to expand the island's
diplomatic arena.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 55 percent were satisfied with Lee's performance as
president, compared with 31 percent who had differing points of view.
This approval rating is almost the same as before his Latin American
trip.

The mass circulation local newspaper conducted the survey by
telephoning 809 adults around the island on Friday.

FEATURE: AUSTRALIA IN UPHILL BATTLE AGAINST HEROIN (I)
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Canberra, Sept. 20 (CNA)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although Australia has begun a long-term
fight against a rising heroin problem, it may not win the uphill
battle, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Capital Territory (ACT) had planned to fight the
drug problem by holding the nation's first heroin trial, with the
backing of the territory's chief minister, Kate Carnell.
</P>
<P>
But the plan was wrecked by the Federal Cabinet, with Prime
Minister John Howard blocking the trial. Howard said the ACT trial
might send the wrong signal about illegal drug use to young
Australians.
</P>
<P>
Howard has ordered the establishment of a Public Service task
force to review anti-drug procedures and draw up an urgent agenda for
national action.
</P>
<P>
But Carnell said the task force was a "knee-jerk reaction" and
that its report would replicate research that had "already been done
many times."
</P>
<P>
"What we need now is action; we've had enough talk and enough
reports," she said. Carnell said she was "somewhat skeptical" of the
task force's credentials and was concerned it was a means of putting
the issue on the back burner.
</P>
<P>
Victoria Premier Jeff Kennett expressed disappointment with
Howard's move and said the state might take on the heroin trial by
itself.
</P>
<P>
"I would just like to make sure we as a community did everything
that any community could, under proper supervision, to try and reduce
the abuse and use of drugs," he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, a total of 620 Australians, mainly youngsters, died of
heroin overdoses, with the number expected to rise to about 700 this
year, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The supporters and opponents of the heroin trial are equal in
number and deeply divided on the issue.
</P>
<P>
New South Wales High Court Justice Michael Kirby said the
punishment of drug users in the criminal justice system is "debasing
our legal system and is a large human rights issue for the future."

<P>
In May this year, Justice James Woods of the same state urged
cautious support for drug law reform -- including the ACT heroin
trial -- to reduce the harm suffered by drug users and the
opportunities for police corruption.
</P>
<P>
But New South Wales Premier Bob Carr opposed the heroin trial,
saying he welcomed the Cabinet blocking of the ACT trial because he
believes the trial would not solve the problem but instead make it
worse because it could send drug prices much higher and increase drug
trafficking in Australia, especially in big cities like Sydney,
Melbourne and Brisbane.
</P>
<P>
Queensland's Health Minister Mike Horan, who opposed the heroin
trial, described the Cabinet decision to block the ACT heroin trial
as "a victory for common sense."
</P>
<P>
Anti-drug campaigner Tony Wood, whose teenage daughter Anna died
after taking ecstasy, said the Cabinet had made the right decision.
</P>
<P>
"Any other decision would have sent the wrong message to young
people," he said.
</P>
<P>
But drug researchers lamented the Cabinet decision, saying it was
made in the face of a scare campaign rather than the scientific
merits of the trial.
</P>
<P>
Gabriele Bammer, a researcher working for the National Center in
Epidemiology and Population Health, said the ACT trial would have
provided the chance to put some of the work carried out in treatment
and prevention "on a good, solid, scientific footing."
</P>
<P>
Alex Wodak, president of the Australian Drug Law Reform
Foundation, said he believes the Cabinet had merely postponed the
inevitable. "The prime minister will not be able to come up with a
better plan (on this issue)," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Alcohol and Other Drugs Council of Australia said the trial
appeared to have been quashed by a combination of international
pressure and political ignorance.

138 DEAD FROM CHOLERA, STARVATION IN INDONESIA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Indonesia's Ministry of Social Services
is currently checking into reports that over 100 people have died in
Jayawijaja regency due to a food shortage and cholera.
</P>
<P>
Regent J.B. Wenas said casualties could be higher because many
villages are in remote areas and cannot be monitored.
</P>
<P>
He said food supplies have been dwindling because the dry spell
since mid-August has caused many plants to die and rivers to dry up.
</P>
<P>
As reported by the Antara news agency, 138 people have died in
the region due to cholera and a limited food supply.
</P>
<P>
Food relief is to be air-dropped to remote areas later, he said.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Social Services Endang Kusuma Inten Soeweno said that
100 tons of rice were sent to Wamena, according to a television
report Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wenas himself said the regency's rice reserves were also low.
</P>
<P>
"We only have two tons of rice supply remaining, which planes
have been having trouble transporting to remote areas due to the
haze," he complained.
</P>
<P>
Wenas said a team of doctors had already been sent to the
worst-hit towns of Silimo, Pasema and Korupul to provide medical
relief, adding that he had also requested the use of military
helicopters to help transport food.

PORNOGRAPHIC PUBLICATIONS DESTROYED IN PUBLIC CEREMONY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   Sept.  21  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tens of thousands of pornographic
publications, including books, videotapes and CD-ROMs, were destroyed
Sunday in a public ceremony held at a square in front of the Taipei
Railway Station, drawing huge crowds of spectators.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the Government Information Office (GIO)
has publicly destroyed contraband publications to signify the
government's determination to wipe out pornography on the island.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ceremony, GIO Director General David Lee said
elimination of pornography and violent crime is one of the top
priorities of Premier Vincent Siew's new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the public destruction of pornographic publications will
help arouse public attention to the harm pornography may have on
minors," Lee noted, adding that the current anti-pornography campaign
cannot succeed without social or public support.
</P>
<P>
To add fanfare to the event, a number of members of the
Legislative Yuan's Education Affairs Committee and representatives
from various women's, religious and other social groups were invited
to the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Lee said law-enforcement authorities confiscated nearly one
million pornographic publications in the first half of this year
alone. The GIO selected some 50,000 volumes of confiscated magazines
and 20,000 videotapes and CD-ROMs for public destruction, while the
remaining illegal publications were sent to paper mills or landfills
for recycling or permanent disposal.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the GIO plans to set up a special task force to track
down the main sources of pornographic publications in cooperation
with prosecution and police authorities. "The new GIO panel will
intensify the crackdown on printing companies and wholesalers of
pornographic works," he said.
</P>
<P>
The GIO will also strengthen the monitoring of nighttime cable TV
programs and will launch an immediate crackdown should any
pornographic programs be detected, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to producing anti-pornography public information
short films, the GIO has also ordered local-level government
authorities to organize publicity programs and intensify probes into
contraband publications.
</P>
<P>
Lee also urged media organizations and various public interest
promotion groups to assist the government in intensifying the
anti-pornography campaign.

BEIJING TO TAKE `POSITIVE'  ACTION  IN CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  21 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland China is presently studying the
possible effect of Taiwan's year-end mayoral and magistrate elections
on cross-strait relations, and one analyst here said on Sunday that
to curb the pro-independence wave on the island, Beijing might take
"positive" action toward pushing cross-strait ties before the
election.
</P>
<P>
Pan Hsi-tang, a professor at Tamkang University, made the
remarks while presiding over a seminar sponsored by an
exchange association between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
The professor said that he received this message very clearly
during a recent visit to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
He said that mainland China probably won't wait until mainland
President Jiang Zemin holds a meeting with US President Bill Clinton
in October or the 9th National People's Congress next March to take
action on pushing for the resumption of cross-strait dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Pan pointed out that major factor affecting Beijing's attitude
toward handling cross-strait relations will be the year-end local
elections in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that both sides of the Taiwan Strait will be willing
to push for political dialogue with the "one China" issue putting
temporarily shelved.
</P>
<P>
He also foresaw both sides continuing to lock horns
diplomatically and speculated that Beijing will make use of the
private sector in Taiwan to prod the government to adjust the
"exercise restraint against too-hasty investment" policy toward
mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Professor Kuo Chan-li of Chinese Culture University also said
that after technocrats have been promoted to higher positions in the
Chinese Communist hierachy, while Qiao Shi, the No. 3 in the
party and long considered a top rival of Jiang, retires from the
political arena, a solidification of Jiang's power base will
contribute to further easing of cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
Kuo said that after the recent 15th Congress of the Communist
Party of China, the priority for cross-strait relations should not be
diplomatic wrestling, but that the focus should be placed on internal
affairs and that both sides should create an atmosphere conducive to
the resumption of talks.
</P>
<P>
Liu Shen-chi, a researcher at National Chengchi University, said
that Jiang will take the chance of his meeting with Clinton next
month to get the US to reaffirm its stance on its "one China" policy,
and that after the meeting, Beijing will take "major" action.

JAPAN  EASES TERMS ON BEIJING WTO ENTRY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva, Sept. 20 (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Japan has broken ranks with the US and the
European Union by signaling that it is ready to let communist China
join the Geneva-based World Trade Organization (WTO) without Beijing
substantially reducing many of its biggest import barriers.
</P>
<P>
EU officials accused Tokyo of compromising on communist China's
WTO entry terms for short-term political reasons and of leaving its
western partners the task of winning trade concessions on Japan's
principal export product, according to reports from the WTO on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Western officials said a bilateral understanding, reached when
Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's prime minister, visited Beijing a week
ago, called on communist China to undertake more modest trade
liberalization than Washington and Brussels are seeking.
</P>
<P>
The understanding, covering communist China's tariffs and quotas
on industrial imports, is seen as a setback for efforts by the WTO's
three largest members to maintain firm pressure on Beijing in its
membership negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Details of Japan's understanding with communist China have not
been published, but Japan is believed to have accepted a communist
Chinese offer to cut tariffs on imported cars to about 50 percent,
from 80 percent, and make modest cuts in tariffs on electronics
products.
</P>
<P>
The US and EU want Beijing to lower car tariffs to no more than
10 percent. They are also pressing Beijing to join WTO members in
agreeing to eliminate all tariffs on information technology products
by early next century.

<P>
The New York State Government plans to
set up a commercial office in Taiwan to help boost bilateral trade
and economic cooperation, a senior state official said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Paolo Palombo, deputy director of the New York State Economic
Development Agency, made the statement while attending a dinner in
honor of a group of business executives from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Palombo said New York State admires Taiwan's economic
achievements and hopes to reinforce commercial ties with Taiwan. "We
plan to open a representative office in Taipei in the near future to
facilitate bilateral commercial exchanges."
</P>
<P>
Taiwan enterprises are welcome to invest in New York State to
facilitate their penetration of the vast US market, Palombo said,
adding that he is particularly interested in the development of
Taiwan's small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
</P>
<P>
Palombo pointed out that SMEs have played an important role in
economic activities in New York State and the entire United States.
"About 70 percent of employed Americans are hired by SMEs."
</P>
<P>
The dinner was jointly hosted by two major overseas Chinese trade
associations in the eastern US area. Several other American
officials, including Aubrey Rogers, director of the New York office
of the US Federal Small and Medium Enterprises Administration, and
Kunimasa Akasaka, a division chief with the New York State Government
in charge of Asia-Pacific economic affairs, also attended the party.
</P>
<P>
The 42-member Taiwan delegation was headed by John C.I. Ni,
director general of the Small and Medium Business Administration.
</P>
<P>
The group had already attended an SME program sponsored by the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Ottawa before coming to
New York.
</P>
<P>
In addition to New York, the mission will also visit Washington,
D.C. and San Francisco to better understand US measures for assisting
SMEs in business expansion, as well as to explore possible trade
deals or joint-venture projects with SMEs operated by Americans and

`STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP' AIMED AT REGULATING BEIJING'S ACTIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The main purpose of a US plan to forge a
strategic partnership with communist China is to regulate Beijing's
international behavior, local political observers said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The observers were responding to a statement made in Japan by US
Assistant Secretary of State Stanley Roth earlier this month that the
United States is willing to form a strategic partnership with
mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Roth's statement was widely seen as an indicator of the
improvement in Washington-Beijing relations. However, local observers
expressed doubts that there will be any major breakthroughs in
US-mainland China ties in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Lin Chou-shui (DPP-Taipei City) said Roth's remarks
are part of the US government's efforts to reduce Beijing's hostility
and cultivate a friendly atmosphere before mainland Chinese President
Jiang Zemin's planned visit to the United States in October.
</P>
<P>
Lin further pointed out that Roth's proposal to forge a strategic
partnership with mainland China is mainly aimed at establishing
channels of communication and reinforcing methods of exchanging
information to prevent misunderstandings and miscalculations.
</P>
<P>
He said that doesn't think the United States will force Taiwan to
accept Beijing's terms for national unification at the moment, even
if Washington and Beijing form a strategic partnership.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Lin said, the ROC government should still pay close
attention to developments in US-mainland China ties and make
necessary efforts to prevent Washington from sacrificing Taiwan's
interests on the altar of improved engagement with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Lin Cheng-yi, a research fellow with Academia Sinica, Taiwan's
highest academic institute, said forging strategic partnerships with
other countries has been a focus of Beijing's diplomatic work in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
Under this policy, Lin said, mainland China has formed a
strategic partnership and military cooperative ties with Russia, as
well as developing friendly cooperative ties with several Southeast
Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the Clinton administration really cultivates a
strategic partnership with Beijing, it will be limited to action
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
As Washington and Beijing remain far apart on a number of issues,
including human rights, economic liberalization, relations across the
Taiwan Strait and mainland China's application for a seat in the
World Trade Organization, Lin said he doesn't expect a significant
breakthrough in US-mainland China relations following Jiang Zemin's
US visit.
</P>
<P>
Chiu Chao-lin, also an Academia Sinica research fellow, echoed
Lin's view, saying that although both Beijing and Washington hope to
strengthen bilateral cooperation, they will refer to the general
international situation and their own national interests in defining
any new cooperative ties.
</P>
<P>
"It remains uncertain whether the United States and mainland
China will sign a formal agreement or document on the establishment
of a strategic partnership or whether they will just reach a tacit
agreement on the formation of such a partnership," Chiu noted.
</P>
<P>
In any case, Chiu said, the ROC government should maintain a high
level of alert on the development of Taipei-Washington-Beijing
relations and work out feasible strategies to cope with new
challenges ahead.

GOVERNMENT URGED TO PAY ATTENTION TO CHINESE MEDICINE EDUCATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   Sept.  21  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A legislator on Sunday urged the
government to develop and promote education in the field of Chinese
medicine.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Hsiao Chin-lan of the ruling Kuomintang said that
there is still no national Chinese medicine colleges in Taiwan adding
that people still have to travel to mainland China in order to study
the subject.
</P>
<P>
She noted that Taiwan's situation is in strong contrast with that
of South Korea and Japan. Even countries in Europe and Southeast
Asian have attached great importance to the research and development
of Chinese medicine, she pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Hsiao cited statistics showing that there are 2,500 Chinese
medicine schools in the mainland and that over 95 percent of
Western-style hospitals have Chinese medicine wards or specialists.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, Taiwan has no national Chinese medicine colleges.
Many Chinese medicine students have to study on their own before
passing a government exam allowing them to practice. Those who fail
the test mostly travel to the mainland to continue their studies.
</P>
<P>
Initial estimates put the number of Taiwan people studying
Chinese medicine in the mainland at over 10,000.
</P>
<P>
Hsiao said that over 30 percent of local residents regularly
consult Chinese medicine doctors under the National Health Insurance
plan, underlining the need for public Chinese medicine colleges.
</P>
<P>
She said that she and another KMT legislator, Han Kuo-yu, will
hold a public hearing on the issue on Tuesday.

<P>
The European Atomic Energy Community
(EURATOM), the atomic energy arm of the European Union, on Sept. 19
became a member of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development
Organization (KEDO), the international organization which is
supplying a light-water reactor project, including two nuclear
reactors, to North Korea.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by KEDO says that EURATOM's accession to
KEDO sends a strong signal of EU support for the organization and its
activities. EURATOM will contribute 75 million ECUs to KEDO over five
years, it reveals.
</P>
<P>
With this support, it continues, EURATOM will be represented on
KEDO's executive board, which had previously consisted of the
organization's original members -- the United States, Japan and South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
KEDO was established in 1995 for implementing most of the "Agreed
Framework" signed by the US and North Korea in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Agreed Framework addresses international concerns about
nuclear activities in North Korea. If implemented, it will assure
both North Korea's full compliance with its safeguards agreement with
the International Atomic Energy Agency and the complete dismantlement
of those aspects of North Korea's nuclear program, including
reprocessing-related facilities that have undermined the viability of
the international nuclear non-proliferation regime and the stability

MIRACLE OF ASIAN TIGERS IS OVER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
San  Francisco,  Sept.  20 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once the world's fastest-growing
economic region, the Southeast Asian "tigers" may have come to a
premature demise, reported the San Jose Mercury News on Saturday in a
front-page lead story entitled "Miracle is Over in Asia."
</P>
<P>
"The miracle is over," Sathit Uthaisri, executive vice president
of the Bangkok Bank, was quoted as saying. "The tigers are struggling
to survive and the miracle of Asian growth will not come back for a
long, long time."
</P>
<P>
The impact of the breakdown will slow growth across Asia, cause
new economic turmoil for Japan and boost the US trade deficit, as the
tigers try desperately to sell their cheaper goods to American
consumers, observed the report.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is the most distinguished showcase of the downfall of
the Asian tigers. Bangkok today remains crowded with construction
cranes and traffic. But restaurants are deserted, shopping malls are
empty and a sense of the surreal dominates the cityscape. Now people
view the store as a "museum," wondering: "people really used to pay
that much?"
</P>
<P>
Analyzing the steep drop of Southeast Asian economies, the report
cited four major factors: Mainland China, overcapacity, too few
skilled workers, political uncertainty and corruption.
</P>
<P>
Today, mainland China is rushing headlong into a version of
capitalism, said the report, adding that with 1.2 billion people, its
wage rates are still 40 percent below Malaysia, Thailand and the
Philippines and it is sucking up investment that once went to tiger
nations.
</P>
<P>
As no one had expected the tigers to fall so far, so fast,
experts are even more concerned about Asian tiger's future. Today,
all tigers face billions of dollars'-worth of bank loans, empty
office towers and sharply rising interest rates that will inevitably
slow their economies.

HK, TAIWAN, MAINLAND CHINA TO CONTINUE ROBUST GROWTH
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Hong  Kong,  Sept.  22 (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung &amp; Debbie Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China
have been rated top players by both the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) in their latest surveys on the
world's economies.
</P>
<P>
The World Economic Outlook, released ahead of the annual meetings
of the World Bank and IMF here on Sept. 23-25, included Taiwan in the
ranks of "advanced economies" among the Group of Seven and 20 other
leading economies.
</P>
<P>
The world's "advanced economies" are Britain, Canada, France,
Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States (the G-7), Taiwan, Spain,
the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Austria, Denmark, Finland, Greece,
Portugal, Ireland, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Norway, Israel, Iceland,
South Korea, Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore and New Zealand, the IMF
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, mainland China and 37 other countries were listed as
"developing economies."
</P>
<P>
According to the IMF report, Taiwan will continue to enjoy robust
economic growth -- its real GDP will grow 6.2 percent in 1997 and 6.4
percent in 1998 -- and modest inflation.
</P>
<P>
Among the world's "advanced economies," it said, Taiwan's
economic growth in 1997 will be the second-highest, second only to
Ireland's 7.3 percent. The island's growth is forecast to outperform
that of Ireland to become the top economic performer among all
"advanced economies" next year, the IMF report showed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it said Hong Kong's economic performance "remains
impressive as the changeover to Chinese sovereignty has proceeded
smoothly."
</P>
<P>
The report forecast that economic growth in Hong Kong will top
5.3 percent this year, up from 4.9 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Mainland China's economy, forecast to grow 9.5 percent in real
GDP this year after 9.7-percent expansion in 1996, will remain one of
the fastest-growing economies in the world, IMF said.
</P>
<P>
While enjoying robust growths, both Taiwan and mainland China
managed to control their inflation at relatively much lower levels
than most of the leading economies in the rest of the world, the
report indicated. Taiwan's inflation, estimated to grow 2.8 percent,
will reach about 3.4 percent in 1998, while mainland China's
inflation will be 4.5 percent and 5 percent in 1997 and 1998,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
By comparison, Hong Kong has slightly higher inflation -- 7.1
percent for 1997 and 6.5 percent for 1998. The figures, however, are
an impressive improvement over the 8 to 10 percent Hong Kong posted
several years ago, the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
The high-growth and low-inflation performance in mainland China's
soft-landing economy can only be sustained with restructuring of
state enterprises and financial sector reforms, it said.
</P>
<P>
In its latest report, entitled "China in 2020" released on Sept.
18, the World Bank forecast that mainland China will turn out to be
an "economic miracle" in the 21st century. The country will post an
average annual growth of 6.6 percent over the next 25 years.
</P>
<P>
By 2020, mainland China may become the world's second-largest
trading country and its population's purchasing power may exceed that
of the whole of Europe, the World Bank said.

EXPORT ORDERS CONTINUE TO GROW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   Sept.   22  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Export orders received by Taiwan
manufacturers amounted to US$10.2 billion in August, marking a 1.05
percent year-on-year rise, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
It was the sixth consecutive month that Taiwan's monthly export
orders broke the US$10 million mark, according to ministry tallies.
</P>
<P>
Chang Yao-tsung, director general of the ministry's Statistics
Department, attributed the continued growth mainly to brisk global
demand for electronics, information-technology (IT) and textile
products.
</P>
<P>
In August, electronics remained the best-selling item, bagging
US$1.72 billion-worth of orders for an annual growth rate of 19.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
IT and communications products came in second, with monthly
orders reaching US$1.65 billion for a 10.12 percent annual growth.
</P>
<P>
With the global demand for semiconductors, computers and
peripherals expected to remain robust, Chang said Taiwan's export
industry will continue to grow steadily throughout the rest of the
year.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the economy at home and abroad has gradually bottomed
out of the recession since the fourth quarter of last year, Chang
said Taiwan's manufacturing sector has continued to pick up steam
over the past eight months, with basic metal, electric and
electronics industries posting the largest gains.
</P>
<P>
According to MOEA tallies, the United States remained Taiwan's
top customer in August, contributing US$3.08 billion worth of orders,
although the amount represents a 2.62 percent decline from the same
month of last year.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong ranked second, placing US$1.94 billion worth of orders
during the month for a 5.16 percent year-on-year rise. Orders from
Europe amounted to US$1.57 billion, up 7.85 percent from the
year-earlier level, while orders from Japan continued a downward
trend, totaling US$1.06 billion for a 13.87 percent annual decline.
</P>
<P>
Accumulated export orders for the first eight months topped US$81
billion, up 3.85 percent from the same period of last year. If
calculated in New Taiwan dollar terms, factoring in fluctuations in
the exchange rate, the amount marked a 5.2 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
Chang said local manufacturers are generally optimistic about
their future export prospects. A survey of major local exporters,
conducted in August, found that 32.27 percent of the respondents
expect more orders for September, while only 25.7 percent forecast a
drop in export orders in the coming month. The remaining 42.03
percent said they believe export orders will remain almost the same
in September as in August.

GOVERNMENT TO THROW FULL SUPPORT BEHIND MICROCHIP DEVELOPMENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  22 (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Vincent Siew said on Monday that
the government will continue to throw its full support behind the
semiconductor industry, which he described as the mother of all
high-technology production.
</P>
<P>
The semiconductor industry is also playing a key role in Taiwan's
economic development, Siew said, citing the fact that microchip
manufacture contributed 18.4 percent of the entire output from the
island's electronics sector in 1996, up from 2.5 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Siew made the remarks in a keynote speech Monday to kick off the
1997 Semicon Taiwan, the second exhibition and trade fair in Taiwan
since 1996 showcasing the semiconductor manufacture and materials
industry.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 companies from Europe, Japan, the United States and
Taiwan are showing off their latest technologies and products in 850
booths at the three-day exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Siew said Taiwan's sales of semiconductors and related products
are expected to surge 48 percent this year to reach US$3.7 billion.
The development of the island's second science park in Tainan,
southern Taiwan, which will be home to a great number of foundries,
will further help boost cutting-edge microchip technology and
development, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest survey by Semiconductor Equipment and
Materials International (SEMI), sponsor of the 1997 Semicon Taiwan,
the world's investment in silicon wafer manufacturing totaled
US$9.618 billion in the first half of 1997, with Taiwan contributing
some 14 percent of the investment.
</P>
<P>
World investment in microchip-sealing equipment totaled about
US$820 million in the same period, with Taiwan contributing 13
percent of this investment. Investment in testing equipment,
meanwhile, totaled about US$2.138 billion, with Taiwan contributing
12 percent, SEMI reported.

CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONSHIP NEEDS MORE OPEN-MINDEDNESS FROM JIANG
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 22 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chang Jung-kung, member and researcher of
the National Unification Council of the Republic of China, has
observed that after mainland China's President Jiang Zemin completes
the Beijing leadership's internal power structure deployment and his
upcoming state visit to Washington in October, cross-strait relations
will hinge on his willingness to seek mutual agreement between ROC
President Lee Teng-hui's Six-Point Statement and Jiang's own
Eight-Point Principles.
</P>
<P>
Seven Politburo Standing Committee Members have just been elected
in the first plenary session of the 15th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China (CPC). When they appeared in public for the
first time on Sept. 19th, the distance between Jiang and the second
member -- Li Peng -- was obviously several times that between Li and
the other five members, enhancing the image of "Jiang's Era," Chang
added.
</P>
<P>
Since the 14th National CPC congress five years ago, the power of
Jiang's contemporary senior leaders has weakened, while Jiang has
become general secretary of the CPC, chairman of the Central Military
Commission and state president. And with the death of several senior
leaders, Jiang's supremacy has been further enhanced.
</P>
<P>
Chang pointed out that it is unprecedented in CPC history that
Jiang should be allowed to made policy reports in both the 14th and
the 15th congresses. Jiang's leading role in handling policy toward
Taiwan was also reconfirmed at the 15th congress.
</P>
<P>
However, promoting Jiang's eight principles unilaterally without
accepting Lee's six points will not form an equal structure for
bilateral negotiation; only by means of seeking and enlarging on the
points of mutual agreement in both Lee's and Jiang's assertions can a
progressive process of unification be made possible, Chang said.
</P>
<P>
Chang concluded that if Jiang wants to accomplish a breakthrough
in cross-strait development -- terminating the hostile status quo and
signing a peace agreement -- Beijing should respond positively to
Lee's six points, just as Taipei did to Jiang's eight.

TAIWAN RESIDENTS FAVOR MAINTAINING STATUS QUO
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

(By Debbie Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The great majority of Taiwan's residents
favor maintaining the status quo as the best national policy for
cross-strait relations, according to the results of a public opinion
poll released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The poll of l,067 adults, conducted by China Credit Information
Service (CCIS) in August, found that 35.4 percent of respondents
support "keeping Taiwan's political status quo and letting everything
be solved later" regarding cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
About 10 percent of the respondents said they favor "Taiwan
independence, as early as possible." The percentage is slightly
higher than the result of a similar poll held in February, and is
worthy of notice by the government, said Lin Chung-ping, vice
chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC).
</P>
<P>
Only 5.1 percent said they favor "an early unification," the
survey found.
</P>
<P>
As many as 21.6 percent said a "status quo forever" is the best
policy, while 13.9 percent said they favor "status quo for now and
unification later," and 11.2 percent said they want "status quo for
now and independence later."
</P>
<P>
Lin said it was worrying that the poll found that the percentage
of those who favor "status quo for now and unification later" has
dropped to the lowest level since last August, while the number of
those who favor "independence," or "status quo for now and
independence later," has risen.
</P>
<P>
Similar telephone surveys were carried out by the CCIS in
February, March, August and November last year and in February and
August this year, at the behest of the MAC, the top government agency
in charge of Taiwan's mainland China policy.

MAINLAND ECONOMY MAINTAINS GROWTH WITH CREDIT FROM WORLD BANK
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

(By Huang Chiquan and Eva Chen)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The economy of mainland China is
maintaining its trend of growth, bolstered by credit worth between
US$2.5 billion and US$3 billion from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yuan, Vice Governor of the People's Bank of China, said the
other day in a seminar of the Organization of Hong Kong, Asia and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), that the average economic growth
of mainland China will be kept at 8 to 9 percent in the coming years,
with inflation controlled within 6 percent, so that the economy will
remain stable.
</P>
<P>
A senior World Bank official noted that cooperation between the
World Bank and Beijing will be promoted to a new level in the future.
It is predicted that the mainland's loans from World Bank will remain
at between US$2.5 billion to US$3billion, instead of gradually
decreasing as has been speculated earlier.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the World Bank estimates that the average
economic growth of the mainland over the next 25 years will be 6.5
percent and that it will need large and continuous injections of
capital.
</P>
<P>
Mainland China is already the biggest recipient of World Bank
loans, with almost US$3 billion of credit annually. The World Bank
has already committed a total amount of US$28 billion in credit to
Beijing up to this June, to support its 184 infrastructure projects
intended to eliminate poverty.

PROVIDING  PARAGUAY WITH F-5ES WILL NOT AFFECT ROC'S AIR DEFENSES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  22  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROC Minister of National Defense Chiang
Chung-lin said on Monday that no decision has yet been reached on
whether to donate or sell some of Taiwan's aging fleet of F-5E
fighter planes to Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
Chiang made the remarks during a meeting of the National Defense
Committee of the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
He said that after the establishment of the ROC's
second-generation fighter planes, the air force will phase out some
of its F-5Es. Even with this phase-out, an overall evaluation has
found that the combat-readiness of the air force will not be
affected.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has 250 F-5Es as the backbone of its air defenses, but is
considering retiring some of them after 150 F-16s and 60 Mirage
2000-5s ordered from the United States and France, respectively, are
fully deployed before the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
Chiang said that providing Paraguay with 12 F-5E planes will not
take place all at once, pointing out that the pace of delivery will
hinge on the arrival of the second-generation planes.
</P>
<P>
Questioned as to who was behind the deal with the South American
nation, Chiang denied that the deal was struck during President Lee
Teng-hui's recent Latin American trip, saying it had been under
consideration for some time and that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
and the Ministry of National Defense had the final say on the matter.
</P>
<P>
But he said any deal with Paraguay relating to the planes, which
the ROC bought from the US and cooperated with it to produce, will be
subject to US approval.
</P>
<P>
During the same meeting, Chiang categorically denied that the
ministry is trying to develop miniature submarines as some reports
had claimed earlier, saying that the submarine idea is already
obsolete.
</P>
<P>
He also denied that the ROC has been trying to develop offensive
biochemical weapons, saying the ministry has only studied methods to
defend the island from biological attack.

MOFA PREPARING FOR PRESIDENT LEE'S AFRICAN VISIT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is
preparing for President Lee Teng-hui to visit Africa next year to
shore up diplomatic support for the Republic of China, Vice Premier
John Chang said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions at a Legislative Yuan committee meeting,
Chang, who concurrently serves as minister of foreign affairs, said
the ministry will arrange for Lee to visit as many African allies of
the ROC as possible.
</P>
<P>
The exact dates for Lee's trip and the number of countries that
the president plans to visit have yet to be decided, Chang said,
adding that a formal itinerary will not be finalized until the
ministry has made a comprehensive study.
</P>
<P>
Chang said Lee's visit will not be limited to two West African
states -- Senegal and Burkina Faso -- as some local newspapers had
reported earlier. The ROC currently has some 10 diplomatic allies in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
President Lee told the press during his just-concluded
four-country Latin American trip that he plans to make state visits
next year to African countries that maintain formal diplomatic ties
with the ROC.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Chang said, several West African countries had already
extended formal invitations to Lee in April this year, but due to his
busy schedule, Lee told his West African counterparts that he may
visit their countries in 1998 instead.
</P>
<P>
Chang, who accompanied Lee on his Sept. 4-18 Latin American tour,
further said Lee pledged only US$1.79 million to the ROC's allies in
the region during his trip, not the billions of dollars reported by
the press. Other financial assistance to the four allies -- Panama,
Honduras, El Salvador and Paraguay -- was given in the form of bank
loans, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chang also reaffirmed the government's determination to continue
along the path of pragmatic diplomacy to maintain and enhance the
country's position in the international community.
</P>
<P>
Chang said the ROC has no intention of challenging or provoking
communist China while engaging in its diplomatic work. "While seeking
to expand our diplomatic frontiers, we have also spared no efforts to
maintain stability across the Taiwan Strait," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, Chang said, cross-strait relations and diplomatic
work carry equal weight on the government's political agenda. "I
don't think either one should take precedence over the other," he
asserted.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Chang stressed that if the ROC cannot further
expand its international presence, its national security will be
threatened.
</P>
<P>
In the face of Beijing's never-ending diplomatic offensive
against the ROC since 1949, Chang said, the government has no
justifiable reason to hesitate or retreat from its diplomatic stance.
</P>
<P>
"We have never taken any preemptive action against mainland China
on the diplomatic front," Chang said, adding that the ROC, in many
cases, has simply responded to Beijing's offensive.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the strategy to "end the war with war" means that the
ROC should actively promote diplomatic work and take part in
international activities, Chang said the strategy is mainly aimed at
making Beijing face up to the reality that the ROC has existed for 86
years and is not going to disappear.
</P>
<P>
"We must continue to expand our international presence to let
mainland China understand that it cannot deny our existence and
survival in the international community," Chang said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged Beijing to deal with cross-strait relations in a
pragmatic, realistic manner. "Only when Beijing pragmatically faces
up to the reality that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are ruled
by two separate governments can cross-strait relations make headway,"
he asserted.
</P>
<P>
Chang also told lawmakers that he will give up the foreign
minister portfolio in mid-October when his successor, Jason Hu, ends
his stint as ROC representative to the United States and returns to
Taipei to assume office.

OVERSEAS TAIWAN ASSOCIATIONS SUPPORT AUSTRALIA'S BECOMING REPUBLIC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Canberra,  Sept.  22  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several associations set up by Taiwan
immigrants in Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth and other Australian
cities, have decided to take part in elections to decide who will
attend the constitutional convention in Canberra in early 1998 to
discuss whether Australia should become a republic.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the CNA on Monday, Associate Professor C.L.
Chiou of the University of Queensland in Brisbane, said Taiwan
immigrant associations held a meeting in Melbourne last week in which
a decision was made to support Australia becoming a republic by the
year 2001.
</P>
<P>
The most active organization advocating Australian republicanism
is The Australian Republican Movement, but Prime Minister John Howard
is reluctant to make Australia a republic by the year 2001 and has
appointed 36 representatives from all walks of life to discuss the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-six appointed representatives and 116 elected
representatives from five states and two territories will take part
in the discussion next year.
</P>
<P>
The republican campaign has been stalled for many years by
supporters of a monarchy movement in Australia most of the backers of
which are immigrants from the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
However, support for Australia remaining a monarchy is faltering
now and the republican movement is gaining ground substantially.

HOPES HIGH FOR OPENING WORLD FINANCIAL MARKET
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva, Sept. 21 (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiators
in Geneva remain hopeful of a deal to open world financial markets to
foreign competition by the deadline of mid-December, despite the
impact of currency turmoil in Southeast Asia, according to reports
from the WTO on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Trade officials said the Asian nations involved remained
committed to the WTO talks and to presenting market-opening offers.
However, the currency crisis had inevitably slowed the process
because policymakers were preoccupied with measures to restore
financial stability.
</P>
<P>
In what is seen as an encouraging sign, Singapore this week
joined 32 other countries, including the 15 members of the European
Union, in presenting proposals for improved foreign access to its
banking, insurance and securities sectors. Other members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are said to be working
hard on their own offers.
</P>
<P>
The US, EU and Japan have repeatedly stressed that better market
access offers from the more advanced developing countries in East
Asia are essential for a successful conclusion to the talks on
December 12.
</P>
<P>
Washington refused to join an interim pact in 1995 because offers
from this region and Latin America were judged to be inadequate.
</P>
<P>
However, US officials were at pains to emphasize their
willingness to be flexible and creative in their approach to
financial services liberalization, including phased commitments by
poorer nations. They also pledged not to make more demands on
countries in the talks, beyond those already tabled.
</P>
<P>
In addition, US and other negotiators stressed that WTO rules
already allow countries to take measures to safeguard the stability
of the financial system and said the market-opening moves being
discussed in the WTO would not make that task any more difficult.
</P>
<P>
Discussions are expected to continue over the next two weeks in
other forums, including the International Monetary Fund/World Bank
meeting in Hong Kong next week, the WTO report said.

STATE FIRMS TO SET UP SAFETY BOARD
</P>
<P>
Taipei, Sept. 22 (CNA) The top supervisors from the ROC's eight
state-run enterprises, including the Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC),
met on Sunday to review the safety measures of state-run enterprises
in order to better prevent accidents in the future.
</P>
<P>
The result of the meeting was a decision to consider the
formation of a professional independent third-party to supervise
safety at state-run enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Economic Affairs Minister Wang Chih-kang, who is also the
chairman of the Commission of National Corporations (CNC), told a
news conference after the meeting that it is his commission's top
priority to upgrade industrial safety at state-run enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Although industrial accidents have dropped by 70 percent since
the CNC set up a task force to oversee industrial safety last
September, last week's gas explosion has shown that safety measures
have not been effectively enforced, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, CNC Vice Chairman Cheng Wen-ching reportedly asked the
CPC to establish a fund to provide lifelong financial support for
those critically injured in last week's Kaohsiung gas explosion.
</P>
<P>
CPC officials said the corporation has already agreed to assume
responsibility for the medical expenses of those injured in the
explosion, which has been attributed to company negligence.
</P>
<P>
The explosion, which occurred during routine maintenance on a gas
pipeline, killed six and injured more than 20, three of whom remain
hospitalized in intensive care.

ANTI NUKE GROUPS  STAGE A MOCK BLOCKADE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 22 (CNA)
(By Lawrence Chu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An exercise dubbed the "anti-nuke landing,
sea-land blockade" was carried out Sunday on the northeast coast of
Taiwan, in protest over the construction of the Fourth Nuclear Power
Plant in the area.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of anti-nuclear activists aboard 106 fishing vessels
braved high seas to stage a mock blockade to protest against the
controversial nuclear power project,the forth in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The protest was organized by the Taiwan Environmental Protection
Union and four other anti-nuclear and environmental protection groups
from around the island.
</P>
<P>
The groups gathered at the Yianliao District Fishermen's
Association at around 9:00 a.m. After boarding the fleet of fishing
vessels, all of which were flying banners which read "Oppose the
Fourth Nuclear Plant" the activists surrounded and firebombed another
ship with mock "nuclear reactors" off the coast of Yianliao Township.
</P>
<P>
The activists said two reactors for the new plant are scheduled
to be shipped from Japan to Yianliao later this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another group of land-based anti-nuclear activists
held a public speech in Yianliao to warn local residents of the
dangers of nuclear reactors and to voice their lack of faith in the
Taiwan Power Company's (Taipower's) commitment to environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
Taipower's plan to build the US$4.1 billion, 2700 megawatt
nuclear power plant was approved by the government in 1994 after
several years of delay and protest following the 1986 nuclear
disaster which occurred in Chernobyl in the then-Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
According to official estimates, Taipower produces 21,900
megawatts of power annually, about a quarter of which is generated by
three nuclear power stations elsewhere on the island.
</P>
<P>
Officials have estimated that total output must rise to 36,000
megawatts by 2002 if power consumption is to keep pace with Taiwan's
economic growth.

BEIJING'S MILITARY SPENDING POSES THREAT TO TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Sept.  21  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Communist China continues to pose a
long-term threat to the balance of power in Asia, said Dr. James
Przystup, director of the Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center,
in a statement released over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
In the news release introducing the newly completed "US and Asia
Statistical Handbook, 1997-1998," Przystup pointed out that mainland
China's military expenditure in 1996, as demonstrated in the new
edition of the handbook, might be as high as US$40 billion.
</P>
<P>
Even by the most conservative estimate, mainland China's 1996
military budget was still an increase of 10.5 percent over 1995,
according to the handbook.
</P>
<P>
Przystup warned that the increased military budget is increasing
mainland China's capacity to project power beyond its borders.
</P>
<P>
"China's `missile diplomacy' unleashed against the Republic of
China on Taiwan in 1995 and again in 1996 -- as well as the PRC's
record of providing weapons technology to rogue states such as Iran
and Libya -- may be nothing compared to what's in store if the United
States continues to sit on its hands and refuse to show leadership,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Heritage Foundation's senior policy analyst Richard Fisher
and research associate John Dori said in the introduction of the
handbook that Beijing's provocative use of nuclear-capable missiles
near Taiwan in early 1996 serves as a reminder that the regime is
capable of using extreme force in pursuing its goals.
</P>
<P>
In their view, although the handover of Hong Kong from British to
mainland Chinese control in July this year is an example of Beijing's
peaceful exercise of sovereignty, the regime's intentions toward
Taiwan are less clear.
</P>
<P>
They noted that despite growing trade and signs that previously
faltering dialogue might be resumed, mainland China continues its
military modernization, acquiring weapons tailored for possible use
against Taiwan.

Manila Archbishop Jaime Cardinal Sin on
Sunday thanked President Fidel Ramos for categorically stating that
he is not for charter amendments before the May 1998 national and
local elections.
</P>
<P>
During a homily in a mass celebrated during a peaceful prayer
rally held in a Manila park, Sin said Ramos is no longer a lame-duck
president because he has heeded the call of the Filipino people not
to amend the 1987 constitution at present.
</P>
<P>
A crowd estimated by police at more than half a million attended
the peaceful rally.
</P>
<P>
Prayer rallies against charter change were also held in several
other Philippine cities.
</P>
<P>
Sin described the rallies as gatherings to celebrate a new-found
unity among Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
During his homily, the cardinal reminded the congregation of the
evil of the martial rule which was imposed by former President
Ferdinand Marcos 25 years ago.

thanked Sin and former President Corazon Aquino for their messages

DOH FAVORS RECRUITING VOLUNTEERS TO HELP ENFORCE SMOKING BAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  22  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Department of Health (DOH) is
considering recruiting volunteers from civic groups or local health
agencies to help implement the new regulations banning smoking in
public places, DOH Director General Chan Chi-hsien said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chan made the remarks in response to questions during a committee
meeting at the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Legislators Hsieh Chin-chung of the ruling Kuomintang, Chien
Hsi-chieh of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party and Lin
Hung-chung, who has no party affiliation, all voiced their concerns
about the difficulty in implementing the regulations which took
effect last week.
</P>
<P>
As the government has set aside just NT$10 million (US$359,710)
to implement the smoking ban, the DOH has been constrained by lack of
funds and personnel to give teeth to the ban.
</P>
<P>
The non-profit, anti-smoking, John Tung Foundation has proposed
that the government impose a NT$1 surcharge on every pack of
cigarettes sold to help replenish the anti-smoking fund.
</P>
<P>
Chan said that he supports the idea of imposing a health tax on
smokers, but the Ministry of Finance is opposed to such a plan.
However, he said he will continue to push the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that it is unreasonable to impose a tax on smokers and
asked the government to appropriate more money to fund the
anti-smoking campaign.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said that if the regulations cannot be enforced, the public
will lose faith in the government, and suggested the mobilization of
volunteers.

MND SETS UP EARLY-WARNING TASK FORCE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Defense Minister Chiang Chung-ling said on
Monday that in the face of the mounting military threat from mainland
China, the Ministry of National Defense (MND) has set up an
early-warning task force to monitor and analyze major mainland
military movements and work out precautionary and defensive measures.
</P>
<P>
Testifying before the Legislative Yuan's Defense Committee,
Chiang said mainland China has moved the focus of its military
deployment to its southeastern coastal region since signing an
agreement with Russia on cutting garrison troops along their common
borders.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Chiang said that mainland China's M-class missiles
can be armed with nuclear and chemical warheads and can easily be
deployed in areas from which Taiwan is in range.
</P>
<P>
"These new developments have posed a serious threat to our
national security," Chiang noted.
</P>
<P>
Against this background, the minister said, the defense ministry
has revised its working guidelines for intelligence gathering and has
set up an early-warning task force to intensify monitoring of
military movements in mainland China.
</P>
<P>
The military has also accelerated the renovation of weaponry and
other military equipment and has stepped-up combat preparedness with
a view to building a strong deterrent force to safeguard national
security, Chiang said.
</P>
<P>
The four-star general-turned-Cabinet minister pointed out that
the mainland Chinese army has made significant progress in upgrading
its firepower and mobility, while its navy has purchased Russian-made
K-class submarines and is constructing various models of destroyers
and missile frigates, in addition to developing aircraft carriers.
Meanwhile, the mainland's air force has acquired 48 Russian-made
SU-27 jet fighters and is developing airborne refueling aircraft,
early-warning aircraft, large transport aircraft, J-8/J-10 fighters
and medium-range air-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
Chiang said although mainland China claims it will use peaceful
means and a "one country, two systems" formula to deal with China's
reunification issue, it has consistently refused to renounce the
taking of Taiwan by force.
</P>
<P>
"In addition to purchasing new weapons, increasing the military
budget, working out new combat strategies against Taiwan, beefing up
joint forces combat capabilities and reinforcing military deployment
in its southeastern coastal region, mainland China has also added a
provision to its national defense law which provides a legal basis
for its military to attack Taiwan on the pretext of maintaining
territorial integrity," Chiang said.
</P>
<P>
The minister predicted that mainland China's stance toward Taiwan
will become even tougher as its economy gets stronger, its military
modernization plan reaches completion and its long-range naval and
air combat capabilities are further upgraded.
</P>
<P>
Responding to questions from legislators at the meeting, Chiang
said the ROC has no plans to build or purchase miniature submarines,
as had been reported in local media, describing such craft as
obsolete.
</P>
<P>
He also denied that the ROC was developing offensive biological
weapons. "We have no plans to develop offensive biochemical weapons
and will only develop defensive measures against biochemical attack,"
Chiang added.

SENIOR ROC FINANCE OFFICIALS TO ATTEND APEC MEETING IN HK

<P>
Vice Finance Minister Wu Chia-sheng and
Deputy Governor Liang Cheng-chin of the Central Bank of China (CBC)
will leave for Hong Kong Tuesday to attend a vice ministerial-level
meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum
scheduled to open on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Although Finance Minister Paul Chiu and CBC Governor Sheu
Yuan-dong were forced to cancel their plan to visit Hong Kong last
weekend due to Hong Kong's refusal to grant them entry visas, Wu and
Liang will certainly be able to enter Hong Kong to attend the APEC
meeting, government sources said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong authorities have informed Taipei that all ROC
delegates to the upcoming APEC meeting will be granted visas, the
sources said, adding that due to time constraints, Wu and Liang may
not get their visas until their arrival in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the Hong Kong government has no legitimate
reasons to deny visas to ROC delegates because the Republic of China
is a full APEC member.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming APEC meeting will discuss the economic outlook of
each member economy and review their progress in implementing
various common programs, including cooperation among export financing
institutions, monitoring of capital markets, operations of
credit-rating institutes, reform of pension systems and
increasing transparency of financial market operations.
</P>
<P>
The recent financial crises in major Southeast Asian countries
will also be a focus of discussion at the APEC meeting.
</P>
<P>
Finance Ministry officials said Taiwan is only mildly affected
by the recent Southeast Asian financial fiasco as its overall
economic situation is sound and healthy.
</P>
<P>
Vice Finance Minister Wu will speak on Taiwan's experience in
maintaining financial stability, including its currency exchange
rate and interest rate, at the APEC meeting. He will also suggest
the formation of a regional organization under the APEC framework to
help ensure financial stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Hong Kong, Wu will also hold bilateral talks
with his counterparts from five to six APEC member economies on
issues related to Taiwan's entry to the World Trade Organization.
The schedules for meetings with delegates from the United States,
Singapore, Canada and Thailand have been set, while the schedules
for meetings with Hong Kong and Malaysia have yet to be finalized.
Wu is scheduled to return to Taipei on Sept. 28.
</P>
<P>
APEC groups 18 economies -- Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile,
Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mainland China, Mexico, New
Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea,
Taiwan, Thailand and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports said because of pressure from Beijing, Hong
Kong authorities denied visas to ROC Finance Minister Chiu and CBC
Governor Sheu, who originally planned to leave for Hong Kong on
Saturday to attend a gala party to be hosted by Taipei-based
Chinatrust Commercial Bank to honor senior finance officials and
bankers from around the world in connection with the opening of an
annual joint meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
As the ROC is not a member of the World Bank and the IMF,
Jeffrey Koo, chairman of Chinatrust Commercial Bank, has
consistently hosted a dinner party on the eve of the opening of the
annual IMF-World Bank meeting to allow senior ROC finance
officials and bankers to meet with their foreign counterparts to
exchange views on matters of mutual concern. This year marked the
first time that ROC finance minister and CBC governor were unable
to attend such a gala party.

Resolution No. 2758, which expelled the ROC from the United Nations
to make way for communist China.
</P>
<P>
It is highly regrettable that the 21.5 million ROC people do not
have representation in the United Nations, Aleman said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the ROC was a founding member of the United Nations
and signed the UN Charter in 1945, Aleman said the ROC has never
violated the provisions of the UN Charter. In domestic politics,
Aleman said, the ROC upholds democracy, freedom and human rights. So
far no international forum has ever criticized the ROC for depriving
its people of basic human rights, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the international front, Aleman said, the ROC's economic
strength and democratic development have been one of the key factors
that have helped maintain stability in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Aleman said, the ROC loves peace and has the
capability and willingness to make positive responses to
international demand.
</P>
<P>
"We should give equal opportunities to all countries around the
world to participate in the United Nations and its specialized
agencies in accordance with the principle of membership
universality," Aleman urged.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Fijian Prime Minister Rabuka
called on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to resume dialogue and
make concerted efforts to mend their differences and seek a
resolution to the ROC's UN representation issue.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua maintains formal diplomatic ties with the ROC, while
the South Pacific island nation of Fiji signed an agreement with the
ROC in October 1996 for mutual recognition.
</P>
<P>
The annual UN general debate session provides a forum for top
government leaders of the 185 UN member states to air their views or
stances on major international issues.
</P>
<P>
More countries are expected to voice support for the ROC's UN bid
before the session closes on Oct. 8.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen of the ROC's diplomatic allies jointly proposed a motion
on July 14 asking the UN General Assembly to consider the ROC's UN
bid at its annual plenary session. The UN Steering Committee,
however, decided on Sept. 17 not to put the issue on this year's
agenda. It was the fifth straight year that the ROC's attempt to
rejoin the world body suffered a setback.

TAIWAN PEOPLE DIVIDED ON SUSPENSION OF CROSS-STRAIT TALKS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  23 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan people are divided on whether the
government should feel anxious about the suspension of talks between
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, according to a survey made public
on Tuesday by Taiwan's top agency charting the government's mainland
policy.
</P>
<P>
The survey revealed by the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) found that 47 percent of those interviewed said that the
government should be anxious about the suspension of cross-strait
talks that has lasted for over two years, while 44 percent disagreed.
</P>
<P>
Lin Chong-pin, MAC vice chairman, said that compared with a
similar survey conducted last August, 10 percent more of the
respondents felt that the government should be anxious about the
talks, which were unilaterally suspended by Beijing in the summer of
1995.
</P>
<P>
Some 63 percent of those polled -- compared with 55 percent last
August -- said they believe that if cross-strait talks cannot be
resumed in the near future, this would have an impact on cross-strait
relations. A total of 32 percent disagreed.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-two percent of the respondents said they feel that
mainland Chinese authorities are unfriendly to the government of
Taiwan. The rating was even higher than the 76.1 percent recorded
last March when Beijing launched a series of war games near the
Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
However, nearly 37 percent of those polled said that mainland
Chinese authorities are friendly to the people of Taiwan, much higher
than the some 17 percent of last March.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the priorities of cross-strait exchanges, cultural
exchanges were viewed as the most important by 41.3 percent of the
respondents, followed by trade and economic exchanges (34.2 percent)
and political contacts (12.7 percent).
</P>
<P>
A total of 78 percent of the polled don't believe that Beijing
will keep its pledge that Hong Kong can maintain its own system for
50 years, while 86.8 percent of Taiwan people said they would refuse
to reunite with mainland China under the "one country, two systems"
formula adopted for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
China Credit Information Service, commissioned by the MAC, made
the survey by telephoning 1,067 adults around the island.

'RACIAL RESPECT' LAUNCHED IN SYDNEY TO COUNTER ONE NATION PARTY
</HEADLINE>

(By Peter Chen)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new national organization aimed at
promoting the values of a multicultural society and reconciliation
with the Aboriginal people in Australia was launched in Sydney to
counter the One Nation Party set up by controversial Independent
Member of Parliament Pauline Hanson.
</P>
<P>
"Racial Respect will provide factual information to the community
to counter misleading and racist attitudes," the Liberal Party's New
South Wales Member of Parliament Helen Sham Ho, a Chinese-Australian
migrant from Hong Kong, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"The group is an educative, rather than a protest organization.
We hope it will become a people's movement," she said.
</P>
<P>
Professor Jamie Mackie, national convener of Racial Respect and
emeritus professor at Australian National University, suggested that
Australian-born Asians and children of Australian parents married to
Asians be mobilized so their voices could be heard.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about half of the 800,000 Australians of
Asian descent are in families of mixed marriages.
</P>
<P>
"The pockets of racial prejudice that Pauline Hanson has been
tapping have been there for a long time, but we had forgotten about
them. We are trying to dissolve those attitudes in the pubs and clubs
by helping people to become better informed," Mackie said.
</P>
<P>
The group plans to work with government and non-government
organizations conducting research into immigration and Aboriginal
issues, operate a website and organize events, Mackie said.

WHO PREDICTS EXPLOSION OF HIV-AIDS IN PARTS OF ASIA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Canberra, Sept. 23 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vietnam, mainland China, Burma (Myanmar)
and India are expected to face an explosion in the incidence of
HIV-AIDS by the year 2000, according to the World Health Organization
(WHO).
</P>
<P>
In a meeting in Sydney on Monday, the WHO's regional committee
predicted there would be "a serious explosion" of HIV-AIDS in Asia,
with epicenters in Vietnam, India and Burma.
</P>
<P>
The WHO figures show the incidence of HIV-AIDS in Vietnam is
expected to surge to 300,000 by 2000 from 57,000 in 1996, with cases
in Burma up to 154,600 from 96,300 during the same period. The
figures for India were not made public.
</P>
<P>
The WHO also predicted HIV-AIDS cases in mainland China will
surge to 96,000 in 2000 from 50,000 IN 1996.
</P>
<P>
In Australia, the number of HIV-AIDS cases is expected to remain
the same in 2000 as it was in 1996: 11,000.
</P>
<P>
The WHO report on the Western Pacific region, which covers 37
countries and 1.6 billion people, predicts that by 2000 there will be
31,000 new AIDS cases annually.
</P>
<P>
The same report says more than 65,000 HIV infections had been
reported in the region up to last December, but more than 700,000
people were expected to be infected with HIV by 2000.
</P>
<P>
About a third of infections have been by sexual transmission,
including 13 percent by heterosexual contact. Just over a quarter
have been through intravenous drug use. In almost 40 percent of cases
the transmission method was not known, the WHO said.

FOE OF PAULINE HANSON LIKELY TO UNDERGO BRAIN SURGERY

(By Peter Chen)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Queensland's former Premier Wayne Goss,
one of the prominent Australian visitors to Taiwan, is likely to
undergo brain surgery Tuesday, casting doubts on his drive to oust
Independent Member of Parliament Pauline Hanson, political analysts
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Goss went to visit Taipei and other cities in Taiwan early this
year. Although he lost his premiership in February 1996, he remains a
backbencher in the Queensland Parliament and has influence in
Australian politics as a result of his performance as premier from
1989 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
Friends said Goss felt discomfort while riding his bicycle on
Saturday night and was admitted to the Mater Private Hospital in
Brisbane early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Goss, 46, was asked by Australia's Opposition Leader Kim Beazley
to enter the Federal Parliament, and he intended to take on the seat
currently held by Pauline Hanson.
</P>
<P>
He vowed to defeat Hanson so as to repair the damage done to
Australia's image in Asia and elsewhere by Hanson's anti-Asian views.
</P>
<P>
Hanson first attracted international attention last September
when she declared, "Australia is in danger of being swamped by
Asians." She established her One Nation Party this year and has not
reduced her anti-Asian sentiment.
</P>
<P>
Goss condemned Hanson's racial views while visiting Taiwan this
year.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with CNA in mid-August, Goss said he would like
to see increasing trade and other ties between Queensland and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He was one of the Australian politicians who attended the two-day
Taiwan Update conference sponsored by the University of Queensland on
August 14 and 15 in Brisbane.

US President Bill Clinton Monday morning
praised the reform efforts of United Nations Secretary-General Kofi
Annan and told the world body that he will send a treaty to the US
Senate banning all nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the beginning of a three-week general debate of the
52nd UN General Assembly, Clinton said the United States strongly
supports the leadership of Annan, who is "aggressively pursuing the
most far-reaching reform of the United Nations in its history."
</P>
<P>
To put the United Nations on a sounder financial footing for the
future, Clinton said he has worked out a plan with the US Congress to
pay back the US$1 billion debt that Washington owes the United
Nations, but asked the world body to consider reducing the proportion
of costs the United States presently shoulders.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Clinton also urged the United Nations to create a
permanent international court to try serious humanitarian crimes, and
to act on the expansion of the UN Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"Our common goal should be to enter the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty into force as soon as possible, and I ask for all of you to
support that goal," he said.

AUSSIE WINE EXPORTERS WIN BIGGER SHARE IN ASIAN MARKETS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Canberra,  Sept.  23  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Australia's wine exports to Asia have
surged thanks to its promotion of red wine, bringing the country's
total wine exports to almost US$413 million in 1996-97, up from
US$341 million in 1995-96, according to the Australian Wine Export
Committee (AWEC).
</P>
<P>
Australian wine exports to Asia grew much faster than other
markets in 1996-97, rising 58 percent overall.
</P>
<P>
Japan remained the number one importer in the region with a total
of US$8.7 million.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong was the second largest buyer of Australian wine, valued
at US$8.1 million; followed by Singapore, US$5.2 million; mainland
China, US$4.5 million; Taiwan, US$2.8 million; and Malaysia, US$2.2
million.
</P>
<P>
AWEC officials attributed the growing sales of their wine to
mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan to the fact that drinking two
glasses of red wine a day can help reduce the risk of cardiovascular
disease.
</P>
<P>
In addition, demand in mainland China has also risen because of a
government campaign against grain-based alcoholic drinks, including
their consumption at official functions.
</P>
<P>
The officials said Hong Kong, Taiwan and mainland China are
expected to continue being the region's fastest growing markets due
mainly to their rising purchasing power.

M'LAND CHINA TAKES LION'S SHARE IN FOREIGN INVESTMENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Canberra,  Sept.  23  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland China continued taking the
lion's share of foreign direct investment (FDI) into Asia in fiscal
1995-96 with a total of US$42 billion, while Taiwan won a rising
share in FDI, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD).
</P>
<P>
In its World Investment 1997 report, UNCTAD says Asia saw total
foreign direct investment inflows leaping 25 percent to a record
US$81 billion in 1995-96 with mainland China receiving nearly half of
that amount.
</P>
<P>
But ASEAN member countries have seen their proportion of the
investment cake dramatically reduced during the past six years as
other countries lured FDI with lower labor costs and incentives.
</P>
<P>
Singapore, however, was the star performer, being second only to
mainland China in Asia by attracting US$9 billion in FDI, according
to the UN report.
</P>
<P>
Investments into the industrial economies of Hong Kong, Taiwan,
South Korea and Singapore rose 27 percent in 1995-96 over 1994-95,
the same report says.
</P>
<P>
The electronics sector was the leading investment target in
Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore, with services the major interest
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
South Asia emerged as a new winner with India's investment flows
rising 34 percent in 1995-96. Asia took two-thirds of all developing
country FDI inflows, reflecting the confidence felt by foreign
investors in the region's long-term prospects.
</P>
<P>
The UNCTAD report says inflows to mainland China reached record
levels, partly because of the rush by foreign investors to move
before investment incentives were removed but also because of the
mainland government's efforts to promote the rich natural resources
and low labor costs of the country's mid-western provinces.
</P>
<P>
Flows into four ASEAN member countries -- Indonesia, Malaysia,
the Philippines and Thailand -- in 1995-96 totaled an estimated US$17
billion, with flows rising substantially in all but the Philippines,
which suffered a fall in FDI in 1995-96 against a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
In the Asian investment recipient roster, mainland China took the
lead in luring FDI, followed by Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia,
India, Hong Kong, Thailand, South Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines and
Taiwan.

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN M'LAND CHINA FACES CHALLENGES: EXPERTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Hong  Kong, Sept. 23 (CNA)
(By Chang Chien and Eva Chen)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joseph Stiglitz, senior vice president
and leading economic researcher of the World Bank, said that although
the economic potential of mainland China is still enormous, Beijing
also faces many challenges, including irrecoverable loans and a
deteriorating environment.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at a seminar here sponsored by the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund, Stiglitz pointed out some of the
problems mainland China faces:
</P>
<P>
* Irrecoverable credits -- Many of the large loans the state-run
banks offered state-owned enterprises in the past are irrecoverable.
If the reform of state-owned enterprises cannot be promoted smoothly
and successfully, this will surely worsen the situation, and in turn
affect the stability of the financial system, he said.
</P>
<P>
* Deterioration of the environment -- Since the building of a
socialist market economy in mainland China, environmental conditions
have worsened, with 50,000 dying from pollution each year. Mainland
China's releases of harmful carbon compounds are second only to those
of the United States and are projected to increase continuously.
</P>
<P>
* Massive number of people under the poverty line -- A large
proportion of the population in mountainous and inland areas lives
under the poverty line and needs assistance from the government.
</P>
<P>
* Lack of law and order -- Well-established law and order is
sorely needed in mainland China in order to achieve a greater
economic success.
</P>
<P>
William Purves, group chairman of the Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai
Banking Corp. Holdings, also observed in the seminar that the hectic
competition among the enterprises in mainland China will result in
still more loans becoming irrecoverable.
</P>
<P>
A total of 20 million job opportunities must be provided to
absorb the labor force laid off by state-owned enterprises and the
newly increased labor force from the rural communities, Purves added.

<P>
President Lee Teng-hui will attend the
ninth Asia Outlook seminar to be held in Taichung, central Taiwan on
Oct. 17-21, organizers said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The annual seminar provides a forum for elite Taiwan and Japanese
politicians, scholars and industry leaders to exchange views on
matters of mutual concern, ranging from bilateral relations to
regional and international issues.
</P>
<P>
Although the event is private in nature, both the Republic of
China and Japan have attached great importance to the annual
gathering as it can help boost mutual understanding and forge good
will in the absence of official ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
This year's meeting will focus discussion on the development of a
new framework to ensure peace and security in the Asia-Pacific
region, as well as on Taiwan-Japan trade and economic cooperation and
regional cultural development.
</P>
<P>
Other topics to be discussed will include the feasibility of
Taiwan-Japan cooperation in developing Okinawa and possible
cooperative projects in science and technological development.
</P>
<P>
Japan will send a 51-member delegation to attend the forum. The
delegation will comprise members of the Japanese Diet, academics and
senior business executives.
</P>
<P>
The ROC delegation will be led by C.F. Koo, a senior adviser to
President Lee and the top Taiwan negotiator with mainland China.
Other Taiwan delegates will include Chang King-yuh, chairman of the
Mainland Affairs Council; Lin Bih-jaw, deputy secretary-general of
the National Security Council; Sheu Yuan-dong, governor of the
Central Bank of China; and many scholars and experts on international
affairs.

Darryl N. Johnson, director
of the Taipei office of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT),
announced in Kaohsiung on Tuesday that AIT will soon expand the
categories of visa applicants who are not required to appear at the
AIT Taipei office for an interview.
</P>
<P>
Effective October 1, 1997, the following persons will be
routinely exempted from non-immigrant visa interviews:
</P>
<P>
-- Persons over forty years old,
</P>
<P>
-- Persons who have previously traveled to the US on any
category of non-immigrant visa, and
</P>
<P>
-- Children age 14 or younger, if 1) their parents hold US visas
or 2) their parents are entitled to a waiver of personal appearance
and are applying at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Tour group participants whose applications are submitted by
travel agencies will continue to be exempt.
</P>
<P>
This improvement in AIT visa services significantly reduces the
need for interviews and makes for a much more efficient delivery of
services to the public. Currently, approximately 70% of all
non-immigrant visa applicants are exempt from personal appearance.
With these changes, the number will be even greater. The improvement
will especially benefit applicants in southern Taiwan, many fewer of
whom will have to travel to Taipei for interviews.

TAIWAN'S IT INDUSTRY TO PUBLISH SPECIALIZED NEWSPAPER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  23  (CNA)
(By Lawrence Chu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new paper specializing in promoting
communications and information exchanges in the information
technology (IT) industry is expected to hit newsstands March 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The proposed daily will cover mainly news events and information
relating to the IT industry.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper is being established to meet the increasing demand
here for information about technology as Taiwan moves toward becoming
a "high-tech island."
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is already one of the world's largest IT product
manufacturers, behind the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper will be published in two ways, one using
traditional print media and the other on the Internet in an on-line
edition.
</P>
<P>
According to an official of the Institute for Information
Industry, the daily will be a joint-venture by several prominent
figures in the IT industry, including Acer Group's Stan Shih and
Mitac's Miao Feng-chiang. To help guarantee the newspaper's
independence and objectivity, however, the sponsors will invest money
in it as individuals and not in the capacities as heads of their
companies.
</P>
<P>
The paper's start-up capital will be between NT$100 million
(US$3.5 million) and NT$200 million (US$7 million). The percentage of
money to be contributed by each investor has not yet been determined,
but publication is scheduled to begin March 1 next year, the official
said.

M'LAND BANKING SYSTEM AFFECTED BY REFORM OF STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Hong  Kong, Sept. 23 (CNA)
(By Chang Chien and Eva Chen)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joseph Stiglitz, senior vice president
and leading economic researcher of the World Bank, noted that the
banking and financial systems in the Chinese mainland will be
affected by the reform of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar sponsored by the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund, Stiglitz pointed out that one of the
challenges the economic development of mainland China will face is
irrecoverable credit, worsened by the reform of state-owned
enterprises, which in turn will affect the stability of the financial
system as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Stiglitz stressed that the loans state-run banks provided to
state-owned enterprises in the past were never processed according to
economic principles, resulting in an increasing shortage of capital
and loans becoming irrecoverable.
</P>
<P>
If state-owned enterprises cannot be successfully reformed, the
situation will certainly worsen and inevitably shake the financial
system, he said.
</P>
<P>
And unfortunately this was not addressed at the 15th national
congress the Communist Party held recently, he added.
</P>
<P>
William Purves, group chairman of the Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai
Banking Corp. Holdings, also observed in the seminar that since the
reforms will take a long time to implement fully, the problem of
recovering the loans should be handled seriously.

Taipei,  Sept. 23 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's jobless rate hit 3.03 percent in
August, the second highest since last October, according to
statistics made public by the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).
</P>
<P>
The statistics show that the number of the unemployed reached
287,000 in August, compared with 297,000 recorded a year earlier. The
average unemployment rate stood at 2.76 percent between January and
August.
</P>
<P>
A DGBAS senior official said that August always sees higher
unemployment rates, as many new graduates from colleges and high
schools enter the job market that month.
</P>
<P>
The labor force totaled 9.45 million in August, up 24,000 people
or 0.25 percent from last month. The figure represents an increase of
165,000 people or 1.77 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The labor participation rate registered 58.41 percent in August,
compared with 58.34 percent in July and 57.96 percent last August.
The labor participation rate is the number of people who want to work
as a percentage of the total population aged 15 or over.
</P>
<P>
The number of the employed reached 9.17 million in August, up
7,000 or 0.07 percent from July. The figure represents an increase of
175,000 people or 1.94 percent from the same period last year.

ROC LOOKS POSITIVELY ON NEW JAPAN-US SECURITY GUIDELINES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Vincent Siew said on Tuesday that
the Republic of China holds a positive attitude toward the signing of
revised security guidelines between Japan and the United States if
the guidelines can really contribute to peace and stability in the
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Siew made the remarks in response to an interpellation from
Legislator Ju Gau-jeng (Independent-Kaohsiung City), who questioned
the government's stance on Tokyo's and Washington's failure to
consult with Taiwan before including the Taiwan Strait in areas to be
subject to the new guidelines for Japan-US defense cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Siew said as the ROC is not a signatory of the new guidelines, it
cannot fully understand their true spirit. Nevertheless, Siew said,
if the United States and Japan are really concerned about stability
in the Taiwan Strait, the ROC welcomes their new defense cooperation
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
The premier further said that because the guidelines do not
explicitly mention the Taiwan Strait, the ROC was not in a position
to ask the United States and Japan to consult with it on the issue
before they sealed the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Siew pointed out that stability in the Taiwan Strait is critical
to peace and security in the entire Asia-Pacific region. Based on
this view, he said, it will be in Taiwan's interest if the new
Japan-US defense cooperation guidelines can help ensure security in
the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Siew also stressed that a country's security relies on the joint
efforts of its own people, not on any other country. "We must
strengthen our own combat preparedness and defense capabilities to
sustain national survival and development," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Japan jointly unveiled in New York on
Tuesday the new security guidelines that have replaced a set of
regulations dating from 1978 at the height of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
The new guidelines cover bilateral security arrangements in case
of an armed attack against Japan.
</P>
<P>
The revised guidelines also notably contain a new section
referring to cooperation "in situations in areas surrounding Japan."
Japanese government spokesman Hiroshi Hashimoto told reporters in New
York on Monday that there was no geographical reference in the text,
and that the reference is a "situational concept," but admitted that
Taiwan and the Korean peninsula were potential sources of
instability.

MAINLAND CHINA A PROBLEM IN MISSILE PROLIFERATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Sept.  22 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The most serious problems in missile
proliferation have resulted from communist China's continued refusal
to abide by its commitments to adhere to the Missile Technology
Control Regime (MTCR), a witness told a US Senate hearing on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Testifying before the Senate Subcommittee on International
Security, Proliferation and Federal Services, Dr. W. Seth Carus,
visiting fellow at National Defense University in Washington, D.C.,
noted that Washington began talks with Beijing about missile
proliferation when the communist regime sold the DF-3 intermediate
range ballistic missile to Saudi Arabia in 1988.
</P>
<P>
"On several occasions, the United States believed that it had
received assurances from China that it would end its missile exports.
Repeatedly, however, we have found China providing equipment that
violated such assurances," Carus said.
</P>
<P>
The last time Beijing reaffirmed its commitment to the MTCR
Guidelines and Annex was in October 1994. In return, the United
States ended the sanctions imposed on communist China in August 1993
for selling M-11 missile components to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, recent Pakistani claims to have tested a Hatf-3
missile with an 800-km range casts doubt on these Chinese
assurances," Carus said.
</P>
<P>
"It is generally agreed that if Pakistan has such a missile, it
either was provided a complete Chinese missile, such as the M-9, or
if the missile was indigenously developed, the Pakistanis relied
heavily on Chinese technical assistance," he added.
</P>
<P>
Carus's testimony echoed that of another weapons proliferation
control expert at a Senate hearing on weapons proliferation last
week. Called to testify before the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence, Gary Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project on
Nuclear Arms Control, termed communist China's exports "the most
serious proliferation threat in the world."
</P>
<P>
Milhollin said that in its latest venture, communist China is
helping to build a plant to produce M-11 missiles in Pakistan, and
that the plant could be ready for production within a year.
</P>
<P>
He said that US officials have learned that they were duped in
1992 and 1994 by Beijing's pledges to comply with the MTCR. "They now
realize that China interprets its promises so narrowly as to make
them practically meaningless."
</P>
<P>
Milhollin also said that since last year, the US intelligence
community has completed the findings about communist China's missile
and nuclear transfers. However, the State Department has chosen not
to complete the administrative process for fear that it would have to
apply sanctions and give up its constructive engagement policy toward
Beijing.

EXPERTS WARN AGAINST SPECULATION ON HONG KONG'S RED CHIPS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
San  Francisco,  Sept.  22  (CNA)
(By Neil Lu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hang Seng China-affiliated
Corporations Index, which measures the so-called "red chips," had an
astounding 227 percent increase over the past few months, but
analysts warn that many red chips are overvalued public offerings
with weak performance and untested management.
</P>
<P>
Frenzied investors over the past year have pumped billions of
dollars into the 73 red chips listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
Why? Because of red chips' ties to high-level mainland Chinese
officials and the anticipation of state assets being injected into
the companies to strengthen their earnings, according a San Francisco
Examiner report on Monday.
</P>
<P>
One analyst warns investors to be wary of fragile mainland
Chinese companies with few assets, saying there is no substitute for
solid business fundamentals, even if a red chip boasts strong
political ties.
</P>
<P>
Over the past years, the average price-earning ratio for red
chips was 25 times the companies 1997 earnings -- nearly twice the
average of other Hong Kong-based companies, according to another
analyst.
</P>
<P>
The wild trading led the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to warn last
week that the red chip market was starting to resemble a fledging
emerging market. Edgar Cheng, chairman of the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange, called for stronger enforcement and more disclosure of
information by the secretive red chip companies.
</P>
<P>
Questionable accounting methods plague many red chips. Some red
chip companies fail to disclose important financial information on
their subsidiaries. In other cases, Western investors have been
shocked to find the "guaranteed" rates of return on their investment
suddenly altered and lowered in company reports.
</P>
<P>
However, many finance experts believe the legal and regulatory
environment for red chips is slowly improving, said the report,
predicting that US institutional investors will start pouring
billions of dollars into the stocks -- perhaps as soon as 12 to 18
months from now.

WEGO CHIANG DIES AT 81
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  23  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wego Chiang, the second son of late
Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, died at the Veterans General Hospital
Monday night. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
Chiang, who suffered from hypertension, diabetes and chronic
renal failure, had been in and out of the hospital since November
last year. He was admitted to the hospital Sept. 1 for acute
respiratory failure. His condition worsened several days before his
death from multiple organ failure.
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife Chu Ju-hsueh and only son Chiang
Hsiao-kang, who were with him when he died.
</P>
<P>
Chiang, who had a warm, humorous and vivacious personality, was
considered by some as living under the shadow of his brother, the
late president Chiang Ching-kuo, all his life.
</P>
<P>
Though he was named senior advisor to President Lee Teng-hui in
1993, Wego Chiang later openly supported the New Party, a splinter
party formed by disgruntled members of the ruling Kuomintang.
</P>
<P>
He, together with his nephew Chiang Hsiao-yung, last year
requested to move the bodies of Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Ching-kuo
from their temporary resting places in Taoyuan, northern Taiwan, to
Zhejiang Province, mainland China last year. The reburial proposal
sparked heated debates. But Soong Mayling, the centenarian widow of
Chiang Kai-shek, backed the government's rejection of the proposal
for the time being.
</P>
<P>
Soong, currently residing in New York, was reportedly saddened by
Wego Chiang's death. Though she had not returned to Taiwan to see
him, she had earlier asked someone in Taipei to send him flowers,
sources close to her said.
</P>
<P>
With his death, the male members of the second generation of the
generalissimo's family -- all of whom played major roles in modern
China -- are all gone.
</P>
<P>
Chiang Ching-kuo had three sons, Chiang Hsiao-wen, Chiang
Hsiao-wu and Chiang Hsiao-yung, all of whom died in their prime
because of illness between 1988 and 1996. Chang Hsiao-tzu, another
son born out of wedlock, also died in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Wego Chiang was born Oct. 6, 1916 in Fenghua, Zhejiang Province.
After graduation from Soochow University, he was sent to Germany and
the United States to receive military training. He served in the army
and as president of the Tri-Service University, commander-in-chief of
the the Combined Service Forces and secretary-general of the National
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Vice president Lien Chan, President of the Examination Yuan Hsu
Sui-teh, KMT Secretary-General Wu Po-hsiung, Vice Premier John Chang
and Minister of National Defense Chiang Chung-ling went to the
Veterans General Hospital to pay tribute to Wego Chiang.
</P>
<P>
As the body of the late general, a devout Christian, was moved
from the intensive care unit to the hospital morgue, it was covered
by a cloth emblazoned with a large cross.
</P>
<P>
Many of Chiang's former aids and subordinates also went to the
hospital to pay tribute to the four-star general. Some broke into
tears.
</P>
<P>
The date for his Christian memorial service is yet to be
announced.

CANINES ARE NUMBER ONE PETS IN TAIPEI
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  23 (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dogs are currently the most popular pets
in Taiwan, with most owners considering them "companions" rather than
"belongings," results of a public opinion poll released on Tuesday
show.
</P>
<P>
The pet survey report, the first of its kind in Taiwan, was
conducted by Yang Heng-lin, MD, from National Taiwan University
Veterinary Hospital, who found that 83.1 percent of the Taipei
households which keep domestic animals have dogs as pets.
</P>
<P>
The poll found that about 42.2 percent, or 335,000, householders
in Taipei keep pets in their homes.
</P>
<P>
The figure suggests that people living in metropolitan areas like
Taipei are feeling increasingly isolated and lonely. Keeping a pet is
one way to combat this loneliness, Dr. Yang noted.
</P>
<P>
Birds are the No. 2 choice for pets, accounting for about 14.7
percent of those surveyed, followed by mice (10.4 percent), cats (9.1
percent) and rabbits (1.3 percent), the poll found.
</P>
<P>
Fish were not included in Yang's survey, which can be considered
Taipei's first pet census, "because the fish population was too
difficult to count," she said.
</P>
<P>
Companionship is the top reason behind pet owners' motives for
keeping an animal, followed by "guard duty" and simply as a means of
passing the time, Yang noted.
</P>
<P>
Most owners said they consider their pets more as friends or even
family members than just animals or personal belongings.

TAIWAN'S AVERAGE WAGE INCREASES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  23  (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's salaried workers were paid an
average monthly wage of NT$36,307 (US$1,265) in July, up 5.63 percent
over the same month of last year, the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Cumulatively, monthly salaries amounted to an average of
NT$40,671 (US$1,417) in the January-July period, an increase of 2.9
percent over the year-earlier level, the DGBAS said.
</P>
<P>
The discrepancy in the two figures is because the seven-month
cumulative figure takes into account the annual Lunar New Year bonus
paid to almost all workers in Taiwan in late January or February,
typically amounting to an additional one-and-a-half months' monthly
salary.
</P>
<P>
As of the end of July, the number of salaried employees in the
industrial and service sectors totaled 5.566 million, up 0.96 percent
over the year-earlier level. The increase was mainly attributed to an
army of new graduates entering the job market, the DGBAS report
noted.
</P>
<P>
The service sector, meanwhile, absorbed 47.63 percent of the
entire workforce of the island, with female workers accounting for
49.18 percent of the service sector.
</P>
<P>
The DGBAS tallies reveal that Taiwan's salaried workers worked an
average of 207.5 hours in July and an average of 182.7 hours per
month between January and July.

LOCAL PRESS COMMENT ON TAIWAN'S BID TO BE REGIONAL BUSINESS HUB
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 23 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The following are excerpts of an editorial
carried in Tuesday's edition of local English-language daily the
China Post.
</P>
<P>
`White Paper' Disputable but Sensible
</P>
<P>
The 1997-1998 Taiwan White Paper published recently by the
American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) is getting mixed reactions from
academics and government officials regarding its blunt view on the
Asia Pacific Regional Operations Center (APROC).
</P>
<P>
The paper suggests that Taiwan "establish direct sea, air and
communication links with mainland China to take advantage of Taiwan's
proximity to the world's largest market." Without direct and easy
access to mainland China's market and resources, the paper says, "the
government's plan to turn the island into an Asia Pacific regional
operation center is mere wishful thinking."
</P>
<P>
In fact, the view is not new, as Taiwan's business and industrial
magnates... have more than once urged the government to do just that.
</P>
<P>
AmCham and Taiwan business leaders see eye to eye on this point,
which is regarded by the government as politically sensitive and
"untouchable." President Lee Teng-hui's mainland China policy is "sit
tight and stay put," lest Taiwan be absorbed by mainland China
without a fight.
</P>
<P>
Lee's mainland policy is not to be faulted because it takes into
consideration national security. On the other hand, however, there is
a price to pay, and the APROC plan may be seen to be held hostage.
</P>
<P>
As pointed out by economist Kai Ma, "the government's
restrictions on cross-strait trade and investment will make Taiwan a
less competitive place for multinational companies here."

JOINING SICA MATCHES TAIWAN'S NATIONAL INTERESTS: SIEW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 23 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Vincent Siew on Tuesday said that
the Republic of China's invitation to join the planned System of
Central American Integration (known by its Spanish abbreviation of
SICA) matches the ROC's national interests and is also expected to
help economic development in that region.
</P>
<P>
Siew made the statement while being questioned at the Legislative
Yuan over the invitation, which was described by the premier as one
of the chief achievements of President Lee Teng-hui's two-week visit
to Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Lee's trip took him to the World Congress on the Panama Canal and
official visits to four ROC allies in Central and South America --
Panama, Honduras, El Salvador and Paraguay. He returned with a number
of achievements, including the enhancement of the ROC's international
profile.
</P>
<P>
Siew told legislators that in order to be able to survive in the
international community, Taiwan should seek more cooperative partners
in the international community, to help it bid for its economic and
diplomatic space.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Siew said, being invited to take part in the planned
SICA is "very good" and "quite positive" for the country.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there are over 30 million people in Central
America, which is located very close to the United States, the
largest market in the world. Moreover, the US provides its Latin
American neighbors with many trading favors, such as no limitations
in trade quotas and preferential tax treatment.
</P>
<P>
The premier noted that Taiwan's investment in the area not only
matches Taiwan's national interests, it also can help Central
American countries develop their economies.

according to hospital sources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the China Petroleum Corp. (CPC), which had hired
outside contractors to replace a liquefied petroleum gas pipe,
causing the disaster, settled compensation claims with the families
of the victims, including NT$9 million in damages for each death -- a
record payment for CPC compensation, although only half the amount
originally claimed by the victims' families.
</P>
<P>
The settlement also called for preliminary compensation of NT$1
million (US$35,714) for injured victims who required treatment in
hospital intensive care units.
</P>
<P>
The CPC also promised to provide compensation for motorcycles,
cars and houses damaged in the explosion, once such claims have been

SENIOR ROC OFFICIALS IN HONG KONG FOR APEC MEETING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Hong Kong, Sept. 23 (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung and Debbie Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROC Vice Finance Minister Wu Chia-sheng
and Deputy Governor Liang Cheng-chin of the Central Bank of China
(CBC) arrived in Hong Kong Tuesday to attend a vice ministerial-level
meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum
scheduled to open on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will discuss the economic outlook of each member
economy and review their progress in implementing various programs,
including cooperation among export financing institutions, monitoring
of capital markets, operations of credit-rating institutes, reform of
pension systems and increasing the transparency of financial market
operations.
</P>
<P>
The recent financial crises in several Southeast Asian countries
will also be a focus of discussion.
</P>
<P>
Vice Finance Minister Wu will speak on Taiwan's experience in
maintaining financial stability, including its currency exchange rate
and interest rate. He is also expected to suggest the formation of a
regional organization under the APEC framework to help ensure
financial stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Results of the one-day discussion among delegates from the 18
APEC member-economies will be referred to the ministerial-level
meeting to be held later this month.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Hong Kong, Wu will also hold bilateral talks
with his counterparts from the United States, Singapore, Canada,
Thailand and Malaysia on issues related to Taiwan's entry to the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
ROC Finance Minister Paul Chiu and CBC Governor Sheu Yuan-dong
were forced to cancel plans to attend the meeting due to Hong Kong's
refusal to grant the pair entry visas.
</P>
<P>
A government source from Taipei said the Hong Kong authorities
had no legitimate reason to deny visas to ROC delegates because the
ROC is a full APEC member.
</P>
<P>
APEC groups 18 economies -- Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile,
Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, mainland China, Mexico, New
Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea,
Taiwan, Thailand and the United States.

ROC TO IMPORT WORKERS FROM VIETNAM, LATIN AMERICA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  23 (CNA)
(By H.C.M.)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Republic of China may import workers
from Vietnam and Latin America, the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA)
indicated on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
CLA Chairman C.K. Hsu said that the country has so far imported
laborers only from Southeast Asia to meet its need for workers.
However, new suppliers of workers are needed to solve the acute
demand from local industries and businesses.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has suffered a shortage of local workers in recent years
due to the lower birth rate, the extended education system and rapid
economic growth. The importation of foreign workers is part of the
solution to the labor shortage problem, Hsu said.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1990s, Taiwan has imported over 240,000 workers
from abroad, mainly from the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand and
Malaysia. Of the total, over 30,000 have run away from their assigned
positions to seek better-paying, though illegal jobs in Taiwan. The
runaway problem has become a headache for both employers and the
government, Hsu pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The government is now planning to import laborers from Vietnam,
another Southeast Asian country, and Nicaragua in Central America, he
said. Negotiations with these two countries for an agreement on the
import of workers have already started and it is hoped that an
agreement will soon be reached.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hsu said the government plans to help foreign laborers
in Taiwan better adjust to life here to help increase their work
efficiency. Under the plan, the government will provide better care
to foreign workers in terms of food, boarding, entertainment and
management, he said.

TAIWAN, MEXICO MAY ESTABLISH HIGH-LEVEL DIALOGUE MECHANISM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  23  (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ROC Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) is working on plans to establish a high-level dialogue
mechanism with Mexico in order to provide a channel for bilateral
economic and trade consultations with the Latin American country on a
regular basis.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has conducted several rounds of bilateral consultations
with Mexico on issues related to Taiwan's entry to the World Trade
Organization (WTO), but no dialogue mechanism has been established
for regular economic talks.
</P>
<P>
According to Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) Director General Lin
Yi-fu, who will soon take the position of vice economics minister, he
personally made the suggestion to Mexico that the two countries
establish a mutual system for officials at director or vice
ministerial-level to exchange dialogue. The Mexican government has
agreed to seriously consider the proposal, Lin noted.
</P>
<P>
Lin said Taiwan has reached agreements with 21 WTO
member-countries on terms for Taiwan's entry to the WTO, adding that
bilateral talks with some other WTO members will be resumed soon.
</P>
<P>
During his recent participation in a meeting of the Asian-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum on small- and medium-sized
enterprises held in Canada, Lin said he had also proposed to
Australia that the two countries reopen their channel for dialogue
relating to official business and trade talks. The Australian
authorities have promised to respond soon, he added.

ANOTHER FOREIGN EXCHANGE CRISIS POSSIBLE IN LATIN AMERICA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva,  Sept. 23 (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Another foreign exchange crisis cannot be
ruled out in Latin America if capital inflow to the region slackens,
according to reports from the Geneva-based World Trade Organization
(WTO) on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A survey of the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the
Caribbean estimated that this year, capital inflow of about US$70
billion will more than finance the region's ever-widening current
account deficit.
</P>
<P>
This deficit will equal US$55 billion this year, or 3 percent of
GDP, a percentage similar to that in 1993-94 ahead of the Mexican
currency crisis. The stability of the capital flow has improved this
year over 1994 because it includes a larger percentage of foreign
direct investment in place of short-term speculative capital, the WTO
report said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign capital flow was notoriously volatile, said the report.
"If it is to slacken off, for whatever reason, another foreign
exchange crisis in the region cannot be ruled out."
</P>
<P>
The current account deficit has widened as imports have been
growing faster than exports. Export growth this year is expected to
continue at the same rate as 1996 -- at around 11 percent. But the
pace of import growth is expected to pick up from just over 11
percent to 20 percent. This will turn last year's merchandise trade
surplus into a deficit this year of about US$13 billion, the WTO
report said.

NO CHANGE IN TAIPEI-WASHINGTON RELATIONS: VICE PREMIER
</HEADLINE>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice Premier John Chang said on Tuesday
that although high-ranking exchange visits between the United States
and mainland China are proceeding, they will not impact the current
Taipei-Washington relations.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions at the Legislative Yuan on Taiwan's ties with
the US, Chang said that these links remain solid and that they will
not be strained by US-mainland China exchange visits, by which he was
mainly referring to the October visit to the US of mainland China's
President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
Citing a statement from Stanley Roth, the US assistant secretary
for East Asian and Pacific affairs, indicating that US relations with
Taiwan are based on the "Taiwan Relations Act," Chang said that the
statement reaffirmed that the US will never neglect Taiwan's
interests because of the development of ties with mainland China.
</P>
<P>
The "Taiwan Relations Act" was drawn up to provide a framework
for the maintenance of Taipei-Washington relations in the absence of
official diplomatic links between the two countries. It is defined as
an act to help maintain peace, security and stability in the Western
Pacific and to promote the foreign policy of the US by authorizing
the continuation of commercial, cultural and other relations between
the people of Taiwan and the US.

BEIJING STOPS HONG KONG SIGNING WTO PACT WITH TAIPEI

Taipei,  Sept.  23 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a bid to postpone Taiwan's entry into
the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Hong Kong government has made
it known to Taipei that although it has completed bilateral
negotiations with Taiwan on Taiwan's access to the global trade body,
Hong Kong will not sign a formal pact until Beijing has also finished
its own negotiations for entering the organization.
</P>
<P>
Lin Yi-fu, director general of Taiwan's Board of Foreign Trade,
who was promoted to the post of vice economics minister in the recent
cabinet reshuffle but has yet to assume his new position, said here
Tuesday on his return from an Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum meeting in Canada that a Hong Kong delegate at the
meeting made it clear to him that Hong Kong will not make its pact
with Taiwan official, in order to make sure that the island is not
admitted into the WTO before Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing that Hong Kong's stance is to back Beijing's demand
to be admitted before Taiwan, the delegate denied that Hong Kong has
altered its policy since Beijing took over the former British colony,
although it has never expressed its position so bluntly before.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has completed bilateral negotiations with 21 WTO
member-countries and territories on terms for WTO entry, but only 17
of them have so far inked their agreements. Negotiations are still
under way with five member-countries or economies, including the
United States and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Beijing is proving far more recalcitrant in the concessions it is
prepared to make to obtain WTO membership and its negotiations are
lagging far behind.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The second high-technology trade
fair under the framework of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum to be held in Taipei next January is expected to help
boost Taiwan's external relations and technological exchanges across
the Taiwan Strait, a senior ROC official said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
John C.I. Ni, director-general of the ROC's Small and Medium
Business Administration, said that more than 2,000 technology
experts, industry administrators, trade promoters and business
executives from the 18 APEC member economies are expected to take
part in the Jan. 21-25 trade fair.
</P>
<P>
The fair will feature a dazzling array of avant-garde products
and cutting-edge technology in microelectronics, information
industry, material science, medicine and genetics, machinery and
automation, Ni said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the fair will include a series of seminars on the
latest technological developments and possible international
cooperative projects.
</P>
<P>
Ni said this will be one of the most important international
trade exhibitions to be hosted by the Republic of China since it lost
its United Nations seat in 1971.
</P>
<P>
All 18 APEC members, including mainland China, will send
governmental or private delegates to attend the trade extravaganza,
Ni said.
</P>
<P>
He reported that a Taiwan delegation visited Beijing and Shanghai
in August to brief mainland trade officials and industry executives
on the fair. "The delegation received a warm response from mainland
trade promoters and business people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ni said 200 to 300 mainland delegates are expected to attend,
making the fair the largest-scale cross-strait exchange in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
APEC is a regional forum dedicated to promoting free trade and
investment. It groups 18 economies -- Australia, Brunei, Canada,
Chile, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, mainland China, Malaysia, Mexico,
New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea,
Taiwan, Thailand and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ni announced that the 24th international Small- and
Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) conference will be held in Taipei in
November. As Taiwan has won wide international recognition for its
achievements in SME development, many countries will send
representatives to the meeting to gain a better understand of
Taiwan's experience in this field, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ni had just participated in an APEC ministerial-level meeting on
SMEs in Ottawa before coming to the United States to explore trade
and investment opportunities for Taiwan's SMEs.

SMOKING  TO BECOME TOP KILLER OF AUSTRALIAN WOMEN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Canberra,  Sept.  24  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rate of smoking among Australian
women is much greater than that of neighboring Asian countries and
lung cancer is set to outstrip breast cancer as the number one killer
for Australian women, the Department of Health said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a World Health Organization's committee meeting in
Sydney, Health Minister Michael Wooldridge said the rate of smoking
among Australian women was 23 percent, compared with the average 15
percent in other Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
"With lung cancer amongst women rising at a faster rate than the
increase in breast cancer, we can expect that in the future, lung
cancer in women -- as in men -- will be the largest cancer killer in
this country," he said.
</P>
<P>
A Health Department official said anti-smoking campaigns had
worked well for Australian men, whose smoking rate had plunged to 27
percent from 72 percent in 50 years. But the smoking rate for
Australian women had dropped only to 23 percent now from 26 percent
in 1945.
</P>
<P>
Australia imposes a strict smoking ban in public places and uses
heavier taxes to boost cigarette prices, making them the most
expensive in the world.
</P>
<P>
The purpose is to help reduce smoking, especially among
teenagers, the Health Department official said.

AUSTRALIAN URANIUM PRODUCERS WILLING TO SELL URANIUM TO TAIWAN

<P>
Australian uranium producers are willing
to sell their products to Taiwan if the Australian government gives
the go-ahead.
</P>
<P>
Between July 1996 and June 1997, Australia's two major producers
-- Energy Resources of Australia Ltd. (ERA) and Olympic Dam Ltd. --
exported about 6,000 tons of uranium to more than 10 countries.
</P>
<P>
Australia exports its uranium mainly to Japan, South Korea, the
United Kingdom, Germany, France, Sweden, the United States, Canada,
Finland and Spain.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources said Australian uranium producers are willing to
sell uranium to Taiwan but they first have to apply for export
licenses to the Australian government.
</P>
<P>
They said the current problem of exporting uranium to Taiwan is
the one-China policy under which Canberra has to be cautious in its
approval for selling uranium to Taiwan for fear of offending Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Australia recognizes Beijing politically but maintains close
trade with both Taiwan and the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Australia could
allow uranium exports to Taiwan if Taipei can comply with Australian
export rules which prohibit the use of uranium for anything other
than peaceful means.

LONG QUEUE FOR SETTLEMENT ENTRANCE BY MAINLAND SPOUSES

<TEXT>
<P>
As the backlog of applications for
post-marriage settlement in Taiwan piles up, more than 15,000
mainland spouses are currently on a long waiting list, some of whom
will have to wait until 2012 for a permanent settlement permit,
sources from the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) reported on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The problem has resulted from an increase in the number of
marriages across the Taiwan Strait since Taiwan liberalized civilian
exchanges with mainland China in 1988, MAC Vice Chairman Wu An-chia
said.
</P>
<P>
Since the government began to accept mainland spouses'
applications to settle in Taiwan in 1992, a total of 19,190 have been
filed as of Aug. 31 this year, Wu noted.
</P>
<P>
Although 3,540 of the applicants have been allowed to settle in
Taiwan, the remaining 15,534 are still waiting. Under the current
quota system, the last applicant will not be awarded settlement
permission until 2012, Wu added.
</P>
<P>
Based on humanitarian principles and out of consideration of

TV SOAP OPERA "PEIPING PEACE TALK" AIRED AFTER 15TH CPC CONGRESS

<P>
A soap opera titled "Peiping Peace Talk"
will be aired by Beijing TV Company from Sept. 24th until the end of
the month.
</P>
<P>
The timing of the show is being viewed as a matter of
significance, since it is scheduled to follow General Secretary Jiang
Zemin's reassertion at the Chinese Communist Party's 15th national
congress of the mainland's policy towards political negotiation
across the straits, and is therefore being seen as in accordance with
Jiang's eight-point initiative.
</P>
<P>
According to officials of the Beijing Municipal Publicity
Committee, the show was originally shot in commemoration of 50 years
of communist administration in mainland China.
</P>
<P>
The show is set in April 1949, when the Republic of China's
nationalists Kuomintang and the Chinese communists were engaged in
their second historical peace talk which subsequently broke down.

RARE STOAT SPECIES FOUND IN CENTRAL TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taichung,  central Taiwan, Sept. 24 (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A rare stoat endemic to
Taiwan, which is believed to be an Arctic species which has survived
through the last ice age, was discovered recently on Mt. Hohuan in
central Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
According to Prof. Lin Liang-kung from Tunghai University, who
found the animal, the female, adult stoat weighs 20 grams and is
around 20 centimeters long. It is what is known as a "relic species"
and is considered as important a species in biological terms as
Taiwan's other relic species, the Formosan landlocked salmon. "Relic
species" refers to a species which has survived from a previous age,
such as before the last ice age, when many other species died out.
</P>
<P>
By comparing the DNA of the rare stoat with that of its distant
relatives in Hokkaido island, in northern Japan, Lin found that the
mammal is descended from the Japanese northern stoat and over
probably 10,000 to 60,000 years, has evolved as a unique species in
the isolated highland area of Taiwan which is believed to be the
creature's only habitat.
</P>
<P>
It is biologically significant that an essentially Arctic species
like the stoat, which is likely to be named the Formosan stoat, can
be found in subtropical Taiwan, Lin noted, adding that it suggests
that more previously unknown or rare species of animals and plants
may remain to be discovered in remote and mountainous areas of
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
According to biological records, this is the third stoat of this
kind to have been found in Taiwan. A similar specimen was found dead
in 1966 and is now stored at the National Taichung Museum of Natural
Sciences. A second one was captured five years ago by Prof. Lin near
central Taiwan's Jade Mountain, but he released the animal, mistaking
it for a more common weasel.
</P>
<P>
Since Lin found the stoat in June, he has kept it in a lab at
Tunghai University, feeding her threaded pork and making video tapes
of her behavior.
</P>
<P>
Lin and his researchers are currently establishing observation
posts in areas above 3,000 meters in the Jade Mountain National Park,
in the hope that more specimens will be found and thus contribute to
research into the species.
</P>
<P>
Lin's only worry is that the Formosan stoat's population is under
threat, as it is believed to share its habitat with weasels, which
are far more abundant and will compete with the stoats for limited
food resources. Both species are ferocious carnivores which prey
mainly on mice, shrews and voles.

THREE MORE COUNTRIES APPEAL FOR ROC UN BID
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
New  York, Sept. 23 (CNA)
(By K.C. Huang and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The presidents of Paraguay, El Salvador
and Honduras on Tuesday used their speeches to the UN General
Assembly debate to deliver strong appeals for the Republic of China's
bid to rejoin the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The three presidents unanimously urged the UN to readmit the ROC
based on its own principle of membership universality.
</P>
<P>
Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy said the General
Assembly should reexamine its 1971 Resolution No. 2758 because it
deprives the 21.5 million people of the ROC of the right to take part
in UN activities.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the ROC government has expressed the hope of
negotiating with mainland China to resolve their differences, Wasmosy
offered his country's full support for the ROC stance.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Salvadoran President Armando
Calderon Sol said universality is a basic characteristic of the UN.
</P>
<P>
"All peace-loving countries willing to abide by the UN Charter
should be allowed to join the organization, and based on this
principle, my country fully supports the ROC's readmission to the
United Nations," Calderon said.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina lauded the
ROC for its persistent endeavors in seeking international support for
participation in the UN and other international organizations. "We
support this great country's efforts," Reina said in his address.
</P>
<P>
The presidents of the ROC's two other diplomatic allies in
Central America -- Costa Rica and Guatemala -- also addressed the
assembly, but didn't touch on Taiwan's UN bid.
</P>
<P>
Without mentioning the ROC or Taiwan, the minister of foreign
affairs of Latvia also urged the UN to admit as many peace-loving
democratic countries as possible in accordance with the principle of
universality. Latvia recognizes mainland China, but maintains
friendly substantive relations with the ROC.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman and Fijian Prime
Minister Sitiveni Rabuka also drummed up support for the ROC's UN bid
in their speeches to the General Assembly debate.
</P>
<P>
More countries are expected to appeal for the ROC's readmittance
to the world body before the General Assembly's debate session closes
on Oct. 8.
</P>
<P>
The ROC lost its seat in the UN in 1971 when the world body
accepted the communist government in Beijing as the sole
representative of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The UN General Assembly's steering committee rejected for a
fifth straight year to consider a request for readmitting the ROC
during its annual debate which began Monday. The request was made by
Nicaragua and 13 other ROC diplomatic allies.
</P>
<P>
Mainland China strongly opposes representation for the ROC in
the world body. As a permanent member of the US Security Council,
Beijing wields enormous influence as well as a veto in the council.
Last March, mainland China vetoed a resolution in the Security
Council to send monitors to oversee a peace plan in Guatemala,
apparently to punish the Central American country for its support of
the ROC.

TAIWAN ACADEMICS CRITICIZE EDUCATION BUDGET
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 24 (CNA)
(By Lawrence Chu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A huge protest march demanding payment by
the government of education fund arrears is being planned by several
Taiwan academic groups to coincide with National Teacher's Day, which
falls on Sept. 28.
</P>
<P>
The academics are demanding that the central government return
unspent funds from the education budget, plus accrued interest since
1955, which is estimated at around NT$2 trillion (US$70 billion).
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly passed a proposal in July's round of
constitutional reforms to remove the 15 percent annual minimum
requirement of the national budget to be allocated to education.
</P>
<P>
However, statistics show that despite the special provisions
previously stipulated in the constitution, the government has never
actually allocated as much as 15 percent of the country's total
budget to education before.
</P>
<P>
Since the clause was revoked this summer, scholars, educators and
parents have been planning a series of protest activities, including
Saturday's march. Proponents of educational reform are also asking
that the government allot regular funds for the modernization of
Taiwan's rote learning-based school system.
</P>
<P>
Thousands are expected to turn out for the march in Taipei, while
government officials in Kaohsiung have indicated that they will join
a simultaneous march in the island's second-largest city, said an
official from the Humanistic Education Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The march is scheduled to begin at 2:00 p.m. on Saturday, and
will make its way from Taipei's Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall to the
Presidential Office.

REVIEW FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL BIDDING TO BE FAIR AND OPEN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 24 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The committee reviewing bids for contracts
for Taiwan's proposed high-speed railway will base its findings on
"fair, open and just" principles and will not take political factors
into consideration, Tsay Jaw-yang, minister for Transportation and
Communications, said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tsay made the remarks while answering an interpellation from
opposition Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Parris Chang at
the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Chang said if the Chung Hwa High Speed Rail Consortium (CHHSRC),
one of the two principal bidders, wins the bid, it will cast doubt
over the fairness of the bidding process, pointing out that the
consortium is led by the ruling Kuomintang's China Development Corp.
(CDC).
</P>
<P>
Tsay said that the review of the bidders will be held in an
"open, just, fair and transparent" manner.
</P>
<P>
He said the competing systems for the high-speed railway, whether
Japan's Shinkansen, France's TGV or Germany's ICE, all have their
advantages and disadvantages, emphasizing that the ministry will not
tilt in favor of any of them.
</P>
<P>
Tsay said that CDC has not enjoyed any special privilege in the
bidding process, adding that because rival consortia are competing in
the bidding process, the ministry and the public will reap the
maximum benefit by reducing the financial burden on the taxpayer.
</P>
<P>
The railway will be the first public infrastructure project to be
opened to private investors under the "build-operate-transfer" (BOT)
formula, in which private contractors will build the system, operate
it for a certain period of time and then transfer control to the
government.
</P>
<P>
Early estimates put the cost of the project at more than NT$440
billion (US$10.45 billion). Because of the huge sums involved, the
government said the private sector would have to shoulder at least 40
percent of the cost before the project could even be considered.
</P>
<P>
But since competition between CHHSRC and its rival Taiwan High
Speed Rail Consortium (THSRC) has shifted into high gear in vying for
the contract, they are now willing to pay more than the minimum 40
percent of investment, even to the point of cutting the government's
financial input to zero.
</P>
<P>
Their moves followed Tsay's earlier remarks in the Legislative
Yuan, in which he said that if the two rivals submit similar offers,
the two major factors in reviewing the bids will be who will give the
government less financial burden, and who's bidding conditions will
be most beneficial to the government.
</P>
<P>
Legislators, worried that the cutthroat price competition will
compromise the quality of the new railway, also voiced their concern
on Wednesday, but Tsay stressed that the review of the bidders will
not be based solely on the lowest price.
</P>
<P>
Adding ammunition to the bidding war, German Economics Minister
Guenter Rexrort, who is expected here next week at the invitation of
ROC Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang, is expected to campaign for
Germany's IEC system.
</P>
<P>
THSRC, which first began preparing for the bidding in early 1996,
comprises mainly of five domestic groups, as well as GEC Alsthom of
France and Siemens of Germany, and is also planning to invite Rexrodt
and five corporate executives to Taiwan in the near future.
</P>
<P>
CHHSRC, which joined the bidding competition in Oct. 1996, is
comprised of 21 local enterprises and Japan's High Speed Rail
Consortium (JHSRC). It plans to invite high-ranking officials from
Toshiba, Mitsui, Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries -- the four groups which form the backbone of JHSRC -- to
visit Taiwan in mid-October.
</P>
<P>
The final bidding date is set for the end of November,
construction is due to begin in July next year and the railway is
expected to be operational in July 2003.

DEMOCRATIZATION HELPS UPGRADE ROC'S STRATEGIC POSITION: LEE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Lee Teng-hui said on Wednesday
that democratization has helped upgrade the Republic of China's
strategic position and international stature.
</P>
<P>
Lee made the statement in his capacity as Kuomintang chairman at
a weekly meeting of the ruling party's Central Standing Committee
after hearing a report by Vice Premier and Foreign Minister John
Chang on the president's just-concluded four-country Latin American
tour, which took him to Panama, Honduras, El Salvador and Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the latest revision of the Japan-US guidelines for
defense cooperation has taken into account not only Taiwan's
strategic position but also its successful democratization.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that the ROC's democratization has
prompted the international community to consider Taiwan's strategic
position while rebuilding a new world order. "Democratization is
therefore a guarantee for us to survive in the international
society," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lee went on to say that the invitations the four Latin American
countries gave him and the courtesy the United States accorded him
during his recent transit stops in Hawaii all implied a concept:
Democratization has made countries around the world adjust their
attitude toward Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Noting that next year will mark the 10th anniversary of the death
of the late President Chiang Ching-kuo, Lee said Chiang's most
important legacy was his efforts to promote Taiwan's democratic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's democratization has helped break a regional framework
based on US-Japan-mainland China relations and prompted the United
States to adjust its attitude toward Taiwan, Lee observed, adding
that Taiwan must continue to promote democratic reforms in order to
win more friends and international recognition.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chang said he is
convinced that the United States only intends to develop strategic
dialogue, not military cooperation, with communist China.
</P>
<P>
Chang asserted that the statement made by US Assistant Secretary
of State Stanley Roth earlier this month that the Clinton
administration hopes to forge a "strategic partnership" with Beijing
should not be interpreted as that the United States intends to
develop military cooperative ties with mainland China.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, Chang said, Roth's remarks only mean that the
United States wants to conduct strategic dialogue with Beijing. By so
doing, Chang said, Washington will be able to discuss a number of
issues, including those related to trade, human rights, the arms
trade, human smuggling, environmental protection and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
Chang said he doesn't think Roth's remarks imply that the United
States will forge military cooperative ties with mainland China. He
further said the United States will continue to abide by the
provisions of the Taiwan Relations Act and will not change its
commitments to Taiwan.

EU GOVERNMENTS OPPOSING DUTIES ON ASIAN-MADE FAX MACHINES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva,  Sept. 24 (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The European Commission proposed imposing
provisional anti-dumping duties on personal fax machines imported
from Asian countries, including Taiwan, in a move that is expected to
face stiff resistance from many member states of the European Union
(EU), according to reports of the Geneva-based World Trade
Organization (WTO) Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary dumping investigation by the commission has
supported a complaint by Philips of the Netherlands, one of Europe's
two producers of personal faxes, that Asian producers, including
Taiwan, were harming EU competitors by exporting at artificially low
prices.
</P>
<P>
The commission's findings have been strongly criticized by EU
governments opposing the proposal, which are cautiously confident of
mobilizing a majority to reject it when it goes to the Council of
Ministers next month, the WTO report said.
</P>
<P>
Austria, where the Philips' fax plant is located, is believed to
be the only country openly supporting the proposed duties, while the
Netherlands, which has usually backed Philips' dumping complaints in
the past, has not declared its position.
</P>
<P>
Italy, long an enthusiastic supporter of EU antidumping actions,
has come out against the proposal, along with such liberal trading
nations as Britain, Finland, Denmark, Sweden and Germany.
</P>
<P>
The duties would affect fax machines weighing less than 5 kg
produced in mainland China, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan
and Thailand. Most of the machines are made in plants owned by
Japanese, South Korean and Taiwan companies, the WTO report said.

LOCAL PRESS COMMENT ON IMF DIVISION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  24  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The following are excerpts from an
editorial carried in Wednesday's edition of a local English-language
daily, the China Post.
</P>
<P>
IMF Delegates Divided over Market Opening
</P>
<P>
There is a gulf between developed and developing nations, as
delegates to the annual meeting of the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) used the 181-country gathering,
being held in Hong Kong, to diagnose the causes of the Southeast
Asian financial crises and work out solutions for such problems.
</P>
<P>
Finance ministers and central bank governors from developed
countries attributed Southeast Asia's currency and stock market
turmoil ... to weak banking and other financial systems. And they
believe greater openness of these markets is the cure for the
region's economic woes.
</P>
<P>
But on the other hand, the delegates from a group of 24 members
-- which comprises developing nations from Africa and Latin America
as well as Asia -- contended that market openness must take into
account member countries' policy, institutional and financial system
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The wide gap lies in the different development status of the two
blocs of nations.
</P>
<P>
Developed countries generally have a stronger economic base and,
in addition, are blessed with greater political stability.
</P>
<P>
The developed nations have proved to be less subject to major
capital outflows even in the event their financial systems go
seriously wrong.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, many developing countries are not so fortunate as to
have such a solid economic foundation and a stable political system.
... They generally rely heavily on foreign capital in their efforts
to develop economically. The problem with such reliance is that
foreign funds, especially those for investment in the stock and
monetary markets, often pull out of a country just as fast as they
flow in.
</P>
<P>
This is why many developing states are selective in soliciting
foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
However, it is both unrealistic and unfeasible for pursuing such
a protectionist policy. Unrealistic because when an economy grows and
expands, it tends to require a greater infusion of capital. Yet to
restrict the inflow of funds from abroad is to deny an important
source of funding for an economy.
</P>
<P>
It is unfeasible for developing nations to continue to maintain
barriers to foreign investment in their domestic financial markets,
because they can hardly do so without risking retaliation by advanced
countries.
</P>
<P>
But the advanced nations, in pressing foreign governments to open
their markets, do need to take into account those governments'
domestic economic conditions and give them the breathing space
necessary to make adjustment.
</P>
<P>
Some delegates to the Hong Kong IMF meeting proposed to set up a
fund to counter new currency attacks. Such a fund indeed is necessary
to help quickly control a financial crisis and prevent it from
spilling over to other markets. More fundamental, however, is to
prevent crisis.

demand deposits and demand savings are to be cut by 0.75 percentage
points while whose on time deposits and time savings deposits will be
reduced by 0.15 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Hsu added that the CBC's weighted reserve requirements on all
kinds of deposits are to drop to 9.1 percent from August's 9.42
percent.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the adjustment, it is estimated that around NT$40
billion (US$1.4 billion) in funds will be injected into the capital
market to meet strong demand from the local commercial and industrial
sectors.
</P>
<P>
The CBC official noted that in order to maintain a normal amount
of capital in Taiwan's banking systems, the central bank might again
move to keep local currency markets in check in the future, if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, clarifying reports that the reserve requirement cuts
are aimed at boosting Taiwan's flagging stock market, Schive Chi,
vice chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development,
told the press the adjustment is one of the CBC's scheduled mid-and
long-term measures for keeping the island's financial development
normal.
</P>
<P>
The bourse's weighted index has plunged more than 1,100 points
over the past four weeks, finishing at 8,994.02 Wednesday. Market
analysts attributed the drop to local investors moving their funds to
foreign currency deposits due to a lack of confidence in the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
It is said that the fund outflows resulted in the newly announced
reserve requirement cuts by the CBC.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's economic growth in 1997,
estimated at 6.58 percent, will be the world's seventh highest this
year and augurs a new round of strong expansion, said Wang Chih-kang,
Minister of Economic Affairs, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the Legislative Yuan, Wang ticked off favorable domestic
economic performances, including August marking the 14th straight
month of growth in Taiwan's industrial output, a more than 7 percent
growth rate in manufacturing for six months running and a 4.2 percent
raise in the value of exports between January and August to US$78.9
billion. All of these bode well for the island's economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang also briefed the legislators on the ministry's current major
schemes, such as improving the country's competitiveness and speeding
up the development of the island's high-tech industry with the goal
of raising the semiconductor industry's output -- estimated to reach
US$30 billion this year -- to US$66 billion in 2005.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that his ministry, in line with Taiwan's efforts to
join the World Trade Organization, has been trying to lower tariffs,
eliminate trade barriers and reconcile the domestic financial and
economic systems with international standards.

POLL FINDS LOW ENVIRONMENTAL CONSCIOUSNESS AMONG LOCAL RESIDENTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  25  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly 100 million used PET bottles are
discarded annually in the Taiwan area without being separated for
recycling, posing a great threat to Taiwan's environment, a
non-profit foundation reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Formosa Foundation conducted a public opinion survey on July
7-9 in an attempt to understand local people's attitudes toward
garbage classification and recycling.
</P>
<P>
The poll of 977 adult residents throughout the island found that
less than 40 percent of the respondents have consistently collected
used tin cans, plastic bags and glassware for recycling.
</P>
<P>
About 49 percent of those surveyed said they usually separate
used paper and PET bottles for recycling.
</P>
<P>
The most worrisome finding was that 30 percent of the respondents
said they usually throw away used PET bottles with the rest of their
garbage.
</P>
<P>
Based on this finding, the foundation estimated 8 million used
PET bottles are discarded each month without being recycled, or about
96 million per year. "This poses a serious threat to our living
environment," a foundation spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the respondents confessed that they had never
divided their trash into recyclable and non-recyclable items, and 74
percent said they did not know that local people who fail to separate
their garbage before disposal will be punished in the future.
</P>
<P>
"Based on these findings, we are worried that the government's
plan to implement mandatory garbage classification in 1999 will
proceed smoothly," the spokesman said, adding he hopes the Cabinet's
Environmental Protection Administration will step up publicity
efforts to enlist public support for the new measure.
</P>
<P>
Survey results show that local people are not satisfied with the
government's performance in promoting garbage classification and
recycling, giving it an average of 54 points in this regard. They
also gave a low grade of 61 points to their own performance in
garbage treatment. Many respondents admitted that laziness on the
part of residents is a major cause of Taiwan's garbage woes.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that female residents outperform their male
counterparts in garbage recycling or treatment, and that those aged
between 20 and 29 have the least environmental consciousness and are
the most reluctant to divide used materials for recycling.

JAPANESE CAR MAKERS PLANNING NORTH AMERICAN EXPANSION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
New  York, Sept. 24 (CNA)
(By David Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Japanese automakers -- Toyota Motor
Corp. and Honda Motor Co. -- are turning up the competitive heat on
the US Big Three again by planning to build more assembly plants in
North America, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Toyota, the No.1 Japanese car maker, is planning a fifth assembly
plant in the United States or Canada, The Journal reported from
Detroit. It also plans to double the capacity of a truck factory it
is building in Indiana to 200,000 vehicles a year.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the daily reported, Toyota is negotiating to buy out
General Motors Corp.'s share of the factory they jointly operate in
Fremont, California. That would enable the company to produce about
100,000 more Toyotas a year, according to GM and Toyota officials.
</P>
<P>
If Toyota pulls all of this off, The Journal said, it would be
able to build about 1.5 million cars and light trucks in North
America annually by early in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Honda is scouting sites for a fourth assembly plant in
the United States or Canada, The Journal reported, citing people
familiar with the company's plans. The size of such a plant isn't
known, but a typical Honda start-up has the initial capacity to build
about 100,000 vehicles a year.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the company built 790,000 vehicles in North America,
and a plant now under construction in Ontario will be building
120,000 new minivans a year by next fall.
</P>
<P>
Should Honda go forward with a new plant, the two companies' new
ventures would lift their combined North American capacity to more
than 2.5 million vehicles annually by early in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
This latest wave of planned expansion reflects the two Japanese
companies' heightened aggressiveness in North America. It also is a
challenge to the Big Three on their home turf -- at a time when North
America already has more plants that its mature market can support,
the Journal concluded.

US CHARGES TAIWAN SRAM MAKERS WITH DUMPING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington, Sept. 24 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan &amp; Debbie Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The US Department of Commerce issued a
preliminary verdict Wednesday affirming charges that Taiwan makers
have been dumping static random access memory (SRAM) chips in the
United States at below market prices.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all semiconductor manufacturers located in the Hsinchu
Science-based Industrial Park in northern Taiwan are affected by the
verdict and must pay a certain amount of money as a guarantee before
delivering new shipments to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department verdict is only a "preliminary" decision,
said department officials, meaning that the US-bound Taiwan-made
SRAM will not immediately be hit with anti-dumping tariffs.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulations, even if the dumping charges filed
by related US firms stand, the Department of Commerce will not
announce the penalties until next April, the officials told CNA.
</P>
<P>
The Department said relevant officials will be dispatched to
Taiwan in October to probe prices. The department will make public
the results of the field investigation in mid-December before holding
a public hearing scheduled for Dec. 23.
</P>
<P>
A verdict will be made on Feb. 10 next year, which will then be
referred to the International Trade Commission for final
adjudication, the officials noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the department report, Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) is the only of five major microchip makers
in the Hsinchu Park to escape the charges.
</P>
<P>
Winbond Electronics Corp. was accused of offering SRAM at prices
94.1 percent lower than market prices, Alliance Semiconductor Corp.,
59.06 percent, and United Microelectronics (UME), 63.36 percent, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Commerce said it sent out questionnaires to 22
SRAM processors in Taiwan for a related poll. Texas Instruments, Best
Integrated Technology and Advanced Microelectronics didn't respond,
prompting the department to declare that these three firms offered
their SRAM in America at prices 113.85 percent lower than market
prices, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the Taiwan SRAM makers were charged with offering
SRAM at prices 41.3 percent lower than market prices. If the
anti-dumping charges stand, products from those companies will be
given a corresponding anti-dumping tariff of 41.3 percent, they
noted.
</P>
<P>
American semiconductor companies first filed complaints in
February with the International Trade Commission, accusing Taiwan and
South Korean microchip makers of dumping SRAM in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan and South Korea exported some US$357 million worth of SRAM
to the United States last year, making them two of the leading
overseas suppliers of the products.

MOEA TO ASSIST SRAM MAKERS IN FIGHT AGAINST US DUMPING CHARGES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  25  (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
will help Taiwan makers of static random access memory (SRAM) make
their position known to the US government and counterpart producers
so as to avoid retaliation and trade friction between the two
countries, a ranking trade official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lin Yi-fu, currently director-general of the Board of Foreign
Trade (BOFT) and soon to become vice economics minister, said the US
anti-dumping charges would have little adverse impact on the island's
SRAM makers as the charges may actually help shore up SRAM prices,
thus benefiting Taiwan manufacturers, which have long been plagued by
marginal profits.
</P>
<P>
Lin said since the BOFT learned of a lawsuit filed by the US firm
Micron in March this year, the government has informed related Taiwan
SRAM makers about possible anti-dumping charges.
</P>
<P>
After the US Department of Commerce surveyed 22 Taiwan-based
electronics companies by sending out questionnaires in April this
year, it charged seven firms, including Winbond, Alliance and UME,
with dumping SRAM in the United States at below market prices.
</P>
<P>
Lin said he was told Winbond's finance staff mistakenly included
shareholders' dividends in its production costs, thus making SRAM
costs appear erroneously high and their US selling prices seem too
low.
</P>
<P>
Because they did not respond to the questionnaires, the US
Commerce Department unilaterally declared that three other companies
-- Texas Instruments, Best Integrated Technology and Advanced
Microelectronics -- offered SRAM in America at prices 113.85 percent
lower than market value.
</P>
<P>
The three companies, however, didn't bother to answer the
questionnaires because they are not SRAM makers, Lin disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The names of the 22 surveyed Taiwan electronics companies were
provided by the American Institute in Taiwan, the de facto US embassy
here.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan exported US$137 million and US$93.4 million worth of SRAM
in 1995 and 1996, respectively, with about half of these exports
going to the United States.
</P>
<P>
About 9 percent of US imports of SRAM come from Taiwan, as
compared with 20 percent from South Korea.

<P>
Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves dropped
to US$87.79 billion in August, their lowest level in nine months, the
Central Bank of China (CBC) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
CBC officials said the August figure represents a US$977 million
decrease from the previous month, and attributed the drop to the
CBC's interference in the foreign exchange market after the currency
crises in Southeast Asian nations last month.
</P>
<P>
The officials noted that the CBC also stepped in the foreign
exchange market in March 1996, when mainland China lobbed missiles
near Taiwan to try to influence the outcome of the island's first
popular presidential election. Foreign exchange reserves dropped to
US$82.55 billion then, down from US$90.08 billion in the previous
month.
</P>
<P>
This year, after the easing of cross-strait tensions, foreign
exchange reserves gradually rebounded to reach US$90.08 billion and
US$90.03 billion in May and June respectively.

ECONOMIC THINK TANK 'CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC' ABOUT TAIWAN ECONOMY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 25 (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Taiwan Institute of Economic Research
(TIER) reported Thursday that it is "cautiously optimistic" about
Taiwan's economic performance for the next six months.
</P>
<P>
Economists at the private economic think-tank predicted that the
island's economy will improve in the next six months as the computer
and electronics industries here keep picking up steam, while negative
factors in the financial sector are gradually dispelled. The late
months of the year are traditionally brisk economically, they noted.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent TIER survey of Taiwan manufacturers,
Taiwan's economic performances in August were not as bright as those
in July, as a result of a flat stock market and tight credit
situation.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the New Taiwan dollar from being affected by the
recent currency crises in Southeast Asia, the Central Bank of China
intervened strongly in the domestic credit market, resulting in the
NT dollar turning strong against other Southeast Asian currencies.
</P>
<P>
This move, however, affected some export-oriented industries,
including household electrical appliances and basic metal, in August,
TIER researchers noted.
</P>
<P>
By industry, iron and steel, computers and electronics enjoyed
August's top production and sales performances and are expected to
continue their high performances through the next six months.
</P>
<P>
The rubber, cement, household electrical appliance and motorbike
sectors, however, have been slow since July and insiders do not
expect the situation to improve significantly in the next six months,
TIER found.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the manufacturers were not as optimistic as TIER. The
survey found that on business prospects for the period between
September 1997 and February 1998, 34.2 percent of the manufacturers
think business will turn better, as compared with the 37.1 percent
recorded in August.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 52 percent of the manufacturers think business will remain
unchanged, against 47 percent in August, while 13.1 percent believe
business will turn worse, as compared with 15.9 percent in August.

US EXPECTS CROSS-STRAIT DIALOGUE TO RESUME NEXT SPRING
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Sept.  25  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States predicts that the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait will resume dialogue next April,
Legislator Rau Yin-chi (KMT-Taitung County) said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Rau, also president of the ROC chapter of the World League for
Freedom and Democracy (WLFD), just returned from a visit to the
United States where he attended the 29th WLFD Congress and met with
many American congressmen, senators, State Department officials and
senior researchers from major think tanks for talks on cross-strait
issues. Rau was accompanied by a group of scholars and lawmakers
from different political parties.
</P>
<P>
During those meetings, Rau said, many American politicians and
academics have explicitly expressed their hope that the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait can resume consultations as soon as possible and
that Taiwan should not provoke mainland China.
</P>
<P>
For their part, Rau and other Taiwan delegates asked the
Americans to explain why the United States and Japan would revise
their defense cooperation guidelines. They also exchanged views on
the feasibility of the US supporting the Republic of China's bid to
join major international organizations.
</P>
<P>
The ROC delegates also expressed their deep concern about the
possible adverse impact on Taiwan of mainland Chinese President Jiang
Zemin's upcoming visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to Rau, the US side stressed that the revised US-Japan
defense cooperation guidelines deliberately avoided mentioning
Taiwan in order not to anger mainland China. However, the Americans
said, the functional goals of the revision of the guidelines have
been reached.
</P>
<P>
American politicians also said following Jiang's US trip in
October, President Bill Clinton will set his schedule for a state
visit to mainland China. Meanwhile, Jiang's leadership will be
stabilized when the next plenary meeting of the National People's
Congress concludes in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, Rau said, many American China hands and
observers said cross-strait dialogue is very likely to
resume next April.
</P>
<P>
According to Rau, the ROC delegation also came to understand
three basic US stances: For fear of mainland Chinese pressure, the
United States would not encourage the ROC to re-join the United
Nations and would only support Taiwan's bid to join non-political
international organizations; the United States strongly opposes
any moves to promote Taiwan independence; and the United States would
not sacrifice Taiwan's interests while seeking to improve relations
with mainland China.

OOCL DENIES ASKING FOR PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Hong Kong-based Orient Overseas
Containers Line (OOCL) has denied allegations by Victoria Premier
Jeff Kennett that it had asked for preferential treatment in building
a full container terminal in Melbourne because it is Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Jack Jeffrey, chairman of Orient Overseas International Ltd.'s
worldwide terminal operations, said Kennett's claim was "insulting
and typical of the way OOCL had been treated over its proposal to
build a A$150 million (US$109 million) container terminal in
Melbourne," according to the Australian Financial Review on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kennett said earlier this week that OOCL, owned by the family of
Tung Chee-hwa, now chief executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administration Region, had sought access to Melbourne's docks for a
container terminal at up to one-tenth of the rates paid by the two
existing major stevedores in the port.

"In other words, they argued that they were Chinese and
therefore, because they are a developing country, we should be giving
them our assets at a rate that was totally uncompetitive," Kennett
said.
</P>
<P>
But Jeffrey rejected any suggestion that the OOCL-led consortium
had sought preferential treatment in its negotiations to lease land
in the Port of Melbourne for a container terminal.
</P>
<P>
"It appears that Mr. Kennett has again received erroneous or
misleading information. At no stage did any representative of OOCL
suggest that being Chinese should allow them some preferential
treatment," Jeffrey said from his office in Long Beach, California.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, such a suggestion is insulting and fairly typical of
the manner in which we, as one of the port's major clients, have been
treated over the last 18 months by both the government and the
Melbourne Port Corporation," he added.
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey said the OOCL consortium "was always perfectly willing to
pay exactly what other stevedores in the port were paying and that
should be a matter of public record."
</P>
<P>
"The government wanted us to pay the wharfage tax that other
stevedores were collecting from port users on facilities provided by
the government. In this case we were providing the facility at a cost
of A$150 million and the government's own documentation specifically
excluded us from the wharfage tax," he said.
</P>
<P>
The collapse of the negotiations between the Victorian government
and OOCL had forced the Hong Kong shipping company to make similar
negotiations with the New South Wales government to build a full
container terminal in Sydney.

CRUCIAL SCREENING MEETING ON HIGH SPEED RAIL THURSDAY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  25  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bureau of Taiwan High Speed Rail
(BOTHSR) is convening a screening committee meeting Thursday
afternoon to decide which of two candidates will build Taiwan's first
high-speed rail system.
</P>
<P>
The committee is scheduled to listen to briefings by the two
bidders and weigh the opinions of the technology screening committee
before deciding whether to open the sealed envelopes containing the
bidding prices.
</P>
<P>
The winning candidate, if one is chosen, and the BOTHSR will
spend the next three months discussing the signing of an agreement on
the construction and operation of the railway project.
</P>
<P>
The two rival bidders -- the Taiwan High Speed Rail Consortium
(THSRC) and Chung Hwa High Speed Rail Consortium (CHHSRC) -- are
vying bitterly for the mammoth project.
</P>
<P>
The THSRC, comprised of five Taiwan companies and GEC Alsthom S.
A. and Siemens Aktiengeselschaft, is proposing to follow France's TGV
and Germany's ICE system, while the CHHSRC, comprised of 21 local
enterprises and the Japan High Speed Rail Consortium, is campaigning
for Japan's Shinkansen system.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei-Kaohsiung high speed railway will be the first public
infrastructure project to be open to private investors under the
"build-operate-transfer" (BOT) formula, in which private contractors
will build the system, operate it for a certain period of time and
then transfer control to the government.
</P>
<P>
The government has said that the private sector would have to be
willing to shoulder at least 40 percent of the estimated NT$440
billion (US$15.38 billion) cost of the new line before the project
could even be considered.
</P>
<P>
Tsay Jaw-Yang, minister of the Transportation and Communications,
said that if the two groups make similar proposals, the decision will
hinge on cost. Both consortiums have announced they will raise
funding beyond the required 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Eager to win the bid, the two candidates have said that except
for the NT$105.7 billion (US$3.69 billion) the government has already
committed to the project -- mainly for the purchase of the land for
the railway -- they are willing to cut the government's spending to a
minimum, even to zero.

CPC CONGRESS PROVIDES GUIDELINES FOR FUTURE DIRECTION OF M'LAND CHINA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Beijing,  Sept.  25  (CNA)
(By Huang Chiquan, Yang Huicheng &amp; Eva Chen)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recently-concluded 15th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), designed to carry the
Party and mainland China into the next century, has profound
significance as a guide to mainland China's future direction.
</P>
<P>
This was the first national congress of the CPC since the death
of such senior Party leaders as Deng Xiaoping, Chen Yun and Peng
Zhen, and the first held under the leadership of the "third
generation," with Jiang Zemin at the core.
</P>
<P>
The congress reconfirmed the undisputed leadership of Jiang
within the CPC, signaling the establishment of the "Jiang Age" in the
Party's power structure.
</P>
<P>
As Deng had requested, the 15th Party congress reconfirmed the
leadership of the third generation, leaving the Jiang Zemin and Li
Peng system unchanged. With the power of the CPC's supreme leaders
reconfirmed, the political stability of mainland China is more
assured.
</P>
<P>
With Hu Jintao, Standing Committee member of Political Bureau,
becoming head of the Secretariat, the importance of the fourth
generation and Hu's position in its leadership was underlined.
</P>
<P>
Hu, 55, was promoted by the CPC's late paramount leader Deng
Xiaoping at the 14th Party congress as the youngest standing member
of the Political Bureau, emphasizing that the Party's power structure
must also cross over to the next century.
</P>
<P>
Wu Bangguo, 54, who will be the standing vice premier of the
State Council; and Wen Jiabao, 55, who has been designated a member
of the Political Bureau, are, along with Hu, rising stars on mainland
China's political stage.
</P>
<P>
By saying the Party will stick to Deng Xiaoping's line for a
hundred years, the 15th CPC congress assumed the function of
proclaiming and promoting the political and economic direction of
communist China during the post-Deng period and into the next
century.
</P>
<P>
Following Deng's line means that his policies of reform and
greater openness will continue, indicating that mainland China will
be increasingly flexible both politically and economically, which in
turn augurs mainland development that will raise the country's
competitiveness and give it a greater impact on world politics.
</P>
<P>
With the Party congress mandating the task of reforming
state-owned enterprises, Beijing's economic reforms have entered a
crucial period, with success hinging on the coordination of other
sectors. The mission is hard though not impossible to achieve and its
result will determine mainland China's fortune in the next century.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the 15th Party congress, Jiang Zemin brought up
mainland China's Taiwan policy, thus putting cross-strait relations
on Beijing's agenda. By reasserting the "one country, two systems"
policy and Jiang's eight point principle, Jiang's report underlined
the importance of political negotiation between the two sides. How
much this will serve as a catalyst for change in Beijing-Taipei
relations will be worthy of scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
The next five years will be key for mainland China's course in
the next century.
</P>
<P>
Whether mainland China will, as Jiang envisions, have a
"democratic, energetic and civilized" future by following the course
charted by Deng, and whether the cross-strait relationship will gain
a more reasonable framework remain to be seen in the next five years.
The answers concern not only mainland China and Taiwan but also the
Asia-Pacific region and even the entire world.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Representatives from 10 organizations
dedicated to promoting the well-being of animals visited the
Legislative Yuan on Thursday to push for legislation to provide for
the protection of animal rights.
</P>
<P>
The representatives presented a petition to the whips of the
three major political parties calling for early passage of a draft
animal protection bill pending legislative approval.
</P>
<P>
The petition was signed by 66,164 animal lovers from all over the
island. The signatures were collected via an islandwide campaign
conducted jointly by the 10 groups between June and September this
year.
</P>
<P>
The representatives also presented a similar petition to the
Council of Agriculture (COA).
</P>
<P>
COA Vice Chairman Lin Shiang-nung said after receiving the
petition that the passage of legislation to protect animal rights
will be another sign that the Republic of China has joined the ranks
of the advanced nations. Fifty-three countries around the world have
already enacted animal protection laws.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the COA-drafted animal protection bill,
raising, breeding and trading in pet animals will be regulated. The
bill will also impose humanitarian regulations on the slaughter of
livestock and place restrictions on the use of laboratory animals for
experimentation.
</P>
<P>
The animal rights activists have also demanded legislation to ban
the use of animals as a gambling device.
</P>
<P>
Legislative caucus heads of the ruling Kuomintang and the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party and the New Party all
promised to complete screening of the new law before the current
session of the legislature ends in late January.

SCIENCE PARK SAYS ANTI-DUMPING CHARGES `INSIGNIFICANT'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  25  (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Static random access memory (SRAM) chip
manufacturers located in the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park
said on Thursday that preliminary dumping charges brought by the US
Department of Commerce will have little adverse impact on their
operations.
</P>
<P>
Instead, said a spokesman for Winbond Electronics Corp., one of
the firms listed by the department, the charges may result in a
better pricing structure for SRAM chips, which will in fact benefit
them economically.
</P>
<P>
Five Hsinchu Park firms were originally listed among 17 Taiwan
SRAM makers by the US Department of Commerce as guilty for dumping
SRAM chips on the United States market at lower than market value.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Taiwan's biggest
microchip manufacturer, was earlier dropped from the list, since it
was described as an OEM producer rather than a direct SRAM maker.
</P>
<P>
The Hsinchu Science Park, Taiwan's "Silicon Valley," churns out
some NT$300 billion (US$10.45 billion)-worth of high technology
products a year, with only about 1 percent, or NT$3 billion
(US$104.53 million)-worth of the output being in the form of SRAM
chips.
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman for Winbond Electronics Corp., which was
also on the dumping blacklist, the US charges may help streamline the
SRAM prices structure, eventually benefiting the makers.

<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Vincent Siew said Thursday that
with the domestic economy maintaining stable and solid growth, the
goal of 6.7 percent economic growth this year remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Siew made the remarks after listening to a report on the present
economic situation by the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD).
</P>
<P>
The CEPD report cited recent predictions by the International
Monetary Fund that although the world economy will continue to grow,
East Asian economies will be influenced by slower economic growth in
Japan and the currency crises in the region, affecting Taiwan's
foreign trade in the short term.
</P>
<P>
Saying that Taiwan's economy remains healthy overall, Siew
cautioned related government agencies to monitor closely the effect
of Southeast Asia's financial situation on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The CEPD also reported commodity prices remained stable in August
and that the manufacturing sector's production increased by 7.6
percent, prompting an increase of employment in industry and a higher
labor participation rate.
</P>
<P>
Another survey by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and
Directorate General of the Budget, Accounting and Statistics also
said the prospects for economic development this year are rosy,
citing the private sector's willingness to invest and an increase in
the implementation of public construction projects.

Wuryastuti Sunaryo, chairman of the Indonesian Tourism Promotion

Renowned British primatologist Dr. Jane
Goodall will arrive in Taiwan on Sunday for a seven-day visit as part
of efforts to promote global research and conservation of wildlife.
</P>
<P>
Goodall, 63, dubbed the "Mother of Chimpanzees," has achieved
fame for her 35-years of devoted research into chimpanzees. Her last
visit to Taiwan was in October of last year, when she delivered a
series of lectures in which she described her work and emphasized the
need for worldwide conservation efforts.
</P>
<P>
While in Taiwan, Goodall will meet with President Lee Teng-hui,
deliver speeches to senior high school students and attend a book
signing to promote her new book "In the Shadow of Man." She will also
travel with Vice President Lien Chan to Kenting National Park in
southern Taiwan to gain a deeper understanding of Taiwan's efforts at
wildlife conservation.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a banquet will be held on October 1 to raise funds
for the establishment of a local branch of the International Goodall
Education and Conservation Association.
</P>
<P>
In 1957, when Goodall was 23, she traveled to Kenya to begin what
was to become a life-time of research into chimpanzees, research

The M2 money supply growth plunged to a
new low of 7.09 percent in August, according to the Central Bank of

<P>
AmCham's members, although pessimistic about cross-strait ties
hindering the development of the APROC (Asian Pacific Regional
Operation Center) plan, are far more worried about the barriers they
face in conducting business in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
...companies of the island's largest trading partner are going
blue in the face, not so much due to the absence of direct links with
the mainland as the unfair treatment they are being subjected to
right here on Isle Formosa.
</P>
<P>
More far-reaching liberalization of the economy and the pursuit
of domestic political stability are immediate concerns too.
</P>
<P>
Its (Taiwan's) attractiveness as a foreign investment destination
is declining, thanks to what AmCham indirectly describes as one of
its primary weaknesses: a meddlesome and clumsy government.
Paternalistic and bureaucratic tendencies in economic management,
lack of careful planning in the drafting of laws which are passed by
a legislature distracted by power struggles, and arbitrary
enforcement of these laws by authorities are just three of the
lowlights AmCham cites in its report.
</P>
<P>
Lest it be forgotten amid all the hype about China being Taiwan's
economic destiny, the United States accounts for more than twice as
large a share of Taiwan's total trade volume -- 21.9 percent as
compared to China's 9.8 percent. It is also the island's biggest
single foreign investor, so when AmCham speaks, politicians and
citizens alike should take notice.

FRENCH-LED GROUP BEATS JAPAN FOR TAIWAN'S HIGH-SPEED RAIL TENDER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  25  (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The French-led Taiwan High Speed Rail
Consortium (THSRC) on Thursday beat its Japanese-led major rival
group in bidding for the contract to construct Taiwan's first
high-speed rail system.
</P>
<P>
THSRC made a bid of NT$336.6 billion (US$11.8 billion) for the
345-km high-speed railway which will link the island's major cities.
It also agreed to contribute 10 percent of its pre-tax earnings to
the government to fund the building of more railways and mass raid
transport systems on the island.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms offered by THSRC, the government will not have to
spend so much as a penny in building the new railway, which is
expected to be operational in 2003.
</P>
<P>
But the French-led consortium is required to complete
negotiations with the government within three months to work out
other terms. If both sides fail to work out a contract, then the
right of negotiation will go to the Japanese-led Chung Hua High Speed
Consortium (CHHSRC), according to Kao Chin-yen, chairman of the
President Enterprise Group and a member of the committee handling the
bidding.
</P>
<P>
CHHSRC offered a NTS$528.6 billion (US$18.5 billion) bid,
including a NT$273.3 billion (9.6 billion) investment by the
consortium and a NT$255.3 billion (US$8.9 billion) investment by the
government.
</P>
<P>
THSRC is comprised of a number of Taiwan companies, including
Evergreen Group, Fubon banking consortium and Continental Engineering
Corporation, as well as GEC Alsthom SA of France and Siemens AG of
Germany. It is proposing to apply technology from France's TGV and
Germany's ICE systems to the Taiwan project.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, CHHSRC, which groups 21 local companies headed by the
China Development Corp. and six Japanese firms, had proposed to use
Japan's Shinkansen system.
</P>
<P>
The consortium which constructs the rail system will be allowed
to operate the system privately for 30 years, after which it will
have to transfer operating rights to the government.

<P>
Window on Alaska, a kind of "Alaskan
showroom," opened on Wednesday in Taipei to help promote trade and
cultural relations between Taipei and Anchorage, capital city of
Alaska, the northernmost US state.
</P>
<P>
Anchorage mayor Rick Mystrom and Taipei deputy mayor Lin
Chia-cheng jointly opened the showroom in the Taipei suburb of
Hsichih.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Lin said Taipei City and
Anchorage have signed an agreement to become "partner cities" to
promote cooperation in trade, cultural and other fields.
</P>
<P>
He said that although Taipei has quite a few sister cities,
Anchorage is Taipei's first partner city, which represents the
special relationship between the two cities.
</P>
<P>
Mystrom meanwhile said his city has pinned high hopes on the
partner city ties, adding that the Window on Alaska, which is
displaying both the natural resources and manufactured products of
Alaska, will play a big role in the promotion of those ties. The
opening of the showroom is just a warm-up for the future close
relations, he said.

FORMER OMBUDSMAN CONVICTED OF BRIBERY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 25 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Taiwan ombudsman Tsai Ching-chu was
sentenced to 20 years imprisonment on Thursday for taking bribes
while serving as a member of the Control Yuan, the nation's highest
watchdog body.
</P>
<P>
He was also precluded from holding public office for ten years
following his release and ordered by the Taipei District Court to
return NT$1.8 million (US$64,285) he had received in bribes.
</P>
<P>
Tsai, who has been in custody since Feb. 27, sat impassively in
the court while the judge read his verdict. He made no comment and
was returned to jail.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines-born Chinese was convicted on three counts of
bribery, including trying to use his authority to facilitate the
floatation of local electronic firm Hsinkai on the stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
The court found that Hsinkai, which had its permission to list
its stocks on the local bourse revoked in 1995 by the Security and
Exchange Commission (SEC) for violations of stock rules, bribed Tsai
with NT$1 million (US$35,714) into trying to pressure the SEC to
reverse its decision.
</P>
<P>
Although the attempt failed because the SEC refused to bow to
Tsai's pressure, Tsai, on Hsinkai's urging, had the Control Yuan
approve his proposal to ask the SEC's superior, the Finance Ministry,
to correct what he called the "inappropriate handling" of the case.
</P>
<P>
The court document said Tsai received 200,000 Hsinkai shares for
his part in the scheme.
</P>
<P>
He also used his position to lean on the local Overseas Chinese
Bank to restore Hsinkai's credit line back up to NT$75 million
(US$2.6 million) from the reduced figure of NT35 million (US$1.2
million), in return for a commission of NT$800,000, said the court
document.
</P>
<P>
Tsai was also convicted of trying to use his influence in 1996 to
force the state-run Taipower Company to reduce a fine it had imposed
on a contractor for a breach of agreement.
</P>
<P>
Tsai received a check of NT$3.28 million (US$117,142) from the
contractor, who eventually asked for the money back when Taipower
refused to back down on its demand.
</P>
<P>
Another six co-defendants in the case, including some who offered
bribes to Tsai and some who served as go-betweens, were also given
jail terms varying between 14 months and two years.
</P>
<P>
They have 20 days to appeal the verdict.
</P>
<P>
Tsai, who served as a legislator between 1984 and 1987, often
caused controversy after becoming a member of the Control Yuan in
1993. As an ombudsman overseeing the behavior of the nation's
government officials, he often broke with tradition by conducting
investigations on his own, instead of working with the other members
of the Control Yuan.

TAIWAN PEOPLE SUFFOCATING THEIR ENVIRONMENT

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan people are suffocating their
environment by dumping nearly 100 million PET bottles every year, a
survey made public on Thursday by the Formosa Foundation has shown.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that only 49 percent of those interviewed said
that they always recycle paper and PET bottles. That means that some
8 million PET bottles are thrown away per month, simply because
consumers are too lazy and inconsiderate to return the bottles to
convenience stores or other collection points.
</P>
<P>
Less than 40 percent of the respondents said that they are
careful to recycle cans, glass bottles and plastic bags, while half
those polled admitted that they never recycle plastic bags.
</P>
<P>
As many as 74 percent of the respondents claimed to be unaware
that the government will enforce the sorting and recycling of garbage
in two year's time and that those who fail to do so will be punished.
</P>
<P>
The respondents gave the government 54 points for the efforts it
has made to promote the sorting and recycling of garbage, while they
scored themselves an average of 61 points in their own
conscientiousness in sorting.
</P>
<P>
Females were found to be more environmentally aware in terms of
garbage sorting than males, while the 20-29 age group was shown to
have the least environmental awareness.

TWO SENIOR ARATS OFFICIALS TO VISIT TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC), which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland China, has
approved applications for two officials of the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) to visit
Taipei, the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The move is part of our government's efforts to promote
high-level exchanges between the SEF and ARATS," said SEF Deputy
Secretary-General Chang Liang-jen.
</P>
<P>
The SEF and ARATS are semi-official intermediary bodies founded
by their respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in
the absence of official ties.
</P>
<P>
According to the SEF, Zhang Shenglin, director of the ARATS
coordination department, will come to Taiwan in mid-October to attend
an award presentation ceremony for a cross-strait children's painting
contest.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zhou Ning, director of the ARATS general affairs
department, will visit Taiwan in December to take part in a seminar
on cross-strait shipping services scheduled to open on Dec. 8.
</P>
<P>
Zhou once participated in many SEF-ARATS high-level meetings
before Beijing unilaterally suspended cross-strait dialogue in
mid-1995 to vent its anger at ROC President Lee Teng-hui's landmark
visit to the United States, which Beijing viewed as a move to promote
Taiwan independence.
</P>
<P>
With the frosty cross-strait ties gradually thawing, another SEF
deputy secretary-general, Lee Ching-ping, managed to make a visit to
mainland China in April this year, marking a reopening of high-level
SEF-ARATS exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the second half of the year, several
senior ARATS officials, including ARATS Deputy Secretary-General Liu
Gangqi, have visited Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
SEF officials said they would be glad to see more senior ARATS
executives visit Taiwan, adding they also hope that high-level
exchanges between the two organizations will gradually normalize on
an equal and reciprocal basis.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the SEF is waiting for an ARATS approval of
its plan to organize a trade and market inspection mission, to be led
by its deputy secretary-general, Chang Liang-jen, to visit mainland
China later this year.
</P>
<P>
ARATS has suggested that Chang and other SEF officials visit
mainland China as advisers to delegations organized by other Taiwan
organizations. However, the SEF wants to organize a delegation on its
own to visit mainland China to better understand the general
situation of Taiwan-funded companies there. "We are still awaiting an
ARATS reply to our request," Chang said.

ROC TO DONATE 12 F-5ES TO PARAGUAY
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Republic of China has decided to
donate 12 F-5E jet fighters to Paraguay, Taiwan's sole diplomatic
ally in South America, Vice Premier and Foreign Minister John Chang
said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The donation of the US-made fighters, including both single- and
double-seat models, will not affect the ROC Air Force's combat
preparedness, Chang said, adding the pace of delivery will hinge on
the arrival in Taiwan of second-generation warplanes.
</P>
<P>
The ROC has 250 F-5Es as the backbone of its air defenses. As the
delivery of the 150 F-16 and 60 Mirage 2000-5 jet fighters ordered
from the United States and France, respectively, under its
second-generation arsenal build-up plan has proceeded smoothly, the
ROC government plans to retire some aging F-5Es.
</P>
<P>
Chang said the ROC will not assist in pilot training after
donating the fighter planes to Paraguay. As to maintenance, Chang
said, the two sides are still negotiating the issue.
</P>
<P>
The donation is subject to US approval because the planes were
originally purchased from the United States. "I don't think this will
be an issue," Chang said.

GEC ALSTHOM VOWS TO BUILD TAIWAN WORLD'S BEST HIGH-SPEED RAIL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Paris,  Sept.  25  (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By awarding the rights to build Taiwan's
first high-speed railway system to the Taiwan High Speed Rail
Consortium (THSRC), the government of the Republic of China made an
exceptionally wise choice Thursday, said GEC Alsthom S.A., a
British-French group.
</P>
<P>
GEC Alsthom will fully collaborate with all partners in the
project, including Germany's Siemens Aktiengesellsachaft and five
Taiwan companies, to build Taiwan the best TGV in the world, said GEC
Alsthom spokesman Robert Pierce.
</P>
<P>
Pierce said the TGV is cozy, cost-efficient and runs at 350 km
per hour (217 mph). In service for 16 years, the system is considered
the symbol of France's technological potency and economic strength.
</P>
<P>
Proud to be part of the THSRC project, Pierce said GEC Alsthom
will try its utmost to transfer technology and help operate, maintain
and manage the system, making Taiwan's high-speed railway on par
France's TGV.
</P>
<P>
The THSRC on Thursday won out over its rival -- Chung Hwa High
Speed Rail Consortium -- by making a bid of NT$336.6 billion (US$11.8
billion) for the 345-km high-speed railway, which will link five to
seven of the island's major cities.
</P>
<P>
A train on the planned system will take only 90 minutes to travel
from Taipei to Kaohsiung, with an operational speed of 300 kph (186
mph).
</P>
<P>
The system will come with a Siemens locomotive, TGV double-deck
railway cars and GEC Alsthom-supplied signal, electrical and
telecommunications systems. The GEC Alsthom-Siemens allied Eurotrain
Group will also provide technologies to Taiwan partners in civil
engineering, Pierce noted.
</P>
<P>
The THSRC is required to submit a complete building and
development plan to the ROC government in six months for a
second-stage screening. If all goes smoothly, construction of the
Taiwan TGV is expected to begin early next year, enabling the system
to become operational in 2003.

DON'T UNDERESTIMATE BEIJING'S MILITARY STRENGTH: ROC OFFICIALS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  26  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two senior ROC officials, including an
Army general, on Friday urged Western countries not to underestimate
mainland China's military strength.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Tung Chao-yang, deputy commander-in-chief, and Lin
Chung-pin, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council, made the
call at a seminar on military education sponsored by the military-run
Fuhsingkang College.
</P>
<P>
Lin, an expert on mainland China's military development, said
mainland President Jiang Zemin's recent statement that the People's
Liberation Army (PLA) will further cut 500,000 troops over the next
few years does not mean mainland China will adopt a demilitarized
policy.
</P>
<P>
"The planned troop reduction is also not expected to mitigate
mainland China's military threat to Taiwan," Lin warned, adding that
the plan to trim the PLA is probably just a mainland Chinese
publicity gimmick.
</P>
<P>
With some 3 million people in uniform, Lin said, mainland China
has strong armed forces. The 500,000 servicemen to be retired are
expected to continue serving as armed police and, if necessary, to
assist the military in carrying out various missions.
</P>
<P>
"We should not ease our combat preparedness simply because the
mainland leadership has promised to further cut its armed forces,"
Lin stressed.
</P>
<P>
The US-trained international affairs specialist said Western
military experts tend to underestimate mainland China's military
strength because Beijing usually would not show them its newest
weaponry systems and military equipment.
</P>
<P>
Against this background, Lin said, Jiang's troop downsizing
promise is very likely to mislead Western countries into believing
that communist China will demilitarize.
</P>
<P>
Lin pointed out that as mainland China has suffered a number of
foreign military invasions since the mid-19th century, building an
elite, strong armed force has consistently been the top priority of
the Chinese communist regime.
</P>
<P>
Tung echoed Lin's view, saying mainland China has made
significant progress in military modernization since 1979 when it
launched an attack on Vietnam to punish its invasion of Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
"The PLA has made remarkable progress in research and development
of military technology and weaponry systems over the past 18 years,"
Tung noted. "We should not underestimate mainland China's combat
preparedness."
</P>
<P>
Tung said the mainland military no longer confines itself to
conventional combat strategy and has managed to develop advanced
combat skills.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Tung said, high-tech weapons cannot ensure success
in a modern war. "Command, organization and adaptability are equally
important," Tung asserted, adding that anyone who can adapt to
changing combat types will be the final victor.

HIGH-SPEED RAIL HELPS BOOST TAIWAN-GERMAN ECONOMIC TIES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Bonn,  Sept.  25  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin &amp; Debbie Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
That a consortium grouping German, French
and Taiwan firms won the right to build Taiwan's first high-speed
railway will definitely help beef up economic and trade relations
between Europe and the Republic of China, an ROC economics official
based in Frankfurt said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan High Speed Rail Consortium (THSRC) -- which groups
France's GEC Alsthom S.A., Germany's Siemens Aktiengesellsachaft and
five Taiwan companies -- on Thursday won the first-stage screening of
the mammoth project over its rival, the Chung Hwa High Speed Rail
Consortium (CHHSRC), with a bid of NT$336.6 billion (US$11.8
billion).
</P>
<P>
The CHHSRC had campaigned for Japan's Shinkansen system for the
345-km high-speed railway linking Taiwan's capital Taipei in the
north and metropolitan Kaohsiung in the south.
</P>
<P>
The THSRC's win also represents a "big gift" to German Economics
Minister Guenter Rexrodt, who is expected to visit Taipei on Sept. 29
at the invitation of his ROC counterpart Wang Chih-kang, said Shen
Sheng-ming, director of the Taipei Trade Office in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
Both the German government and private sector have paid a great
deal of attention to Taiwan's proposed high-speed rail project in the
last several years, Shen noted. In 1995, when then ROC Economics
Minister P.K. Chiang visited Germany, high speed railway development
was one of the major topics at the ROC-German Economics Ministers
meeting, he added.
</P>
<P>
Accompanying Rexrodt will be two ministry directors in charge of
Asia-Pacific affairs, along with a Siemens board member, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei-Kaohsiung high-speed rail will be the first public
infrastructure project opened to private investors under the
"build-operate-transfer" (BOT) formula, in which private contractors
will build the system and operate it for a certain period of time
before transferring control to the government.
</P>
<P>
Siemens' participation in the high-speed railway project is
beneficial for both Germany and Taiwan, Shen said, explaining that
the island will benefit by obtaining know-how on railway building,
electronic transmission and other related technologies while Germany
will gain by adding extra job opportunities to its domestic
industries, which have long been plagued by stagnation.

Justice Minister Liao Cheng-hao has
ordered that a center to combat cyber crime be set up soon in order
to check the rise in the number of criminal cases involving
computers.
</P>
<P>
Liao said that in view of increasing crimes in cyberspace --

TAIWAN BASIC LAW JUST WISHFUL THINKING OF MAINLANDERS: SIEW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  26  (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Vincent Siew Friday rebuked the
alleged drafting of a Taiwan Basic Law in mainland China, saying that
if such a document exists, it is only the wishful thinking of some
mainland Chinese academics.
</P>
<P>
Siew said that to the best of his knowledge the mainland Chinese
authorities do not have such plans at present.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Basic Law, supposedly modeled on the Basic Law that
mainland China applies in the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region, is "concrete proof" of Beijing's declaration of sovereignty
over Taiwan, said a legislator at the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Fielding a question by Chu Hsing-yu, a legislator from the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party on the alleged drafting of a
Taiwan Basic Law, Siew stressed that the Republic of China, as a
sovereign country, pulls its own weight for survival and sustainable
development by adopting pragmatic diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
"We need to constantly stay alert, actively build up this island
and solidify ourselves so as to counteract Beijing's hostility and
pressure," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Chu questioned Siew over how the government would react if
Beijing were to make public the Taiwan Basic Law in 1999 and begin to
put it into force in 2010 as reported.
</P>
<P>
Siew said that as far as he knows, compositions similar to the
Taiwan Basic Law have only been parts of academic research by some
mainland Chinese specialists, adding that the Beijing authorities
have no such plan at present.

AUSTRALIA CALLED NATION OF BASTARDS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Canberra, Sept. 26 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A leading newspaper in Sydney has called
Australia "a nation of bastards" because of a surge in the number of
babies born to unmarried women in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Citing the figures of the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the
Daily Telegraph this week reported that almost one in three babies
was born out of wedlock in Australia.
</P>
<P>
In its front page lead story, headlined "A Nation of Bastards,"
the daily reported the number of married mothers giving birth has
slumped to an all-time low.
</P>
<P>
The number of births out of wedlock in 1996 was 69,568 -- more
than 70 percent higher than 1986, according to the bureau.
</P>
<P>
And 55 percent of these mothers -- 38,298 women -- were 25 years
old or younger. They included 11,202 teenagers, almost 500 of whom
were under 16 years old.
</P>
<P>
The daily said mothers who were born in Australia were more
likely to bear children out of wedlock than women from all other
countries, except New Zealand. One in three Australian-born women has
had a child outside marriage, according to the bureau.
</P>
<P>
The bureau figures show the country's overall fertility rates
reached a record low last year, when 253,834 babies were born.
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, unmarried mothers accounted for only 16 percent of
all births, the bureau noted.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Families Association (AFA) said a study has shown
children of married parents fare much better than those of de facto
couples.
</P>
<P>
AFA president in New South Wales Susan Bastick claimed de facto
relationships "made light" of marriage and lacked the commitment
necessary to provide a stable environment for children.
</P>
<P>
But Family Services Minister Judi Moylan said the figures
reflected changing values in Australia and had now become a "fact of
life."
</P>
<P>
"Politicians are not society's marriage celebrants," she told the
daily.
</P>
<P>
"My concern is that those adults that choose to have children in
or out of wedlock make caring for their children their number one
priority. Regardless of how you describe reaction to the figures, as
a Family Services Minister my over-riding concern and responsibility
is to ensure parents are given every opportunity to raise their
children," she said.
</P>
<P>
"And secondly, that the children themselves are always looked
after in a loving and caring environment," Moylan said.

Despite great pressure from Beijing, German
Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt will not cancel his one-day trip
to Taipei scheduled for Sept. 29.
</P>
<P>
According to relevant officials of the German Economics Ministry,
ever since plans for the visit were announced, their ministry and the
Foreign Ministry have been under pressure from mainland China to
cancel it.
</P>
<P>
To register their protest of the Taipei visit, the mainland
authorities even rejected Rexrodt's plan to meet with mainland
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Minister Wu Yi in Tokyo, the
German officials said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Rexrodt is scheduled to set off for Japan on Friday to attend a
ministerial-level conference of the Asia-Europe summit meeting. From
there, he will fly to Taiwan for an annual talk with his counterpart
of the Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
The economics ministries of the ROC and Germany have been taking
turns sponsoring an annual ministerial-level economic meeting. Since
1991, Vincent Siew, P.K. Chiang and incumbent Economics Minister Wang
Chih-kang have been to Bonn for such meetings.
</P>
<P>
Last year's September meeting, which Taipei was to host, was
canceled because Rexrodt became ill before his flight to the island.
</P>
<P>
The German minister's upcoming Taiwan visit means a great deal to
both the government and private sector of the West European country,
which has won the right to build Taiwan's first high-speed railway.

BEIJING REASSERTS SEEKING STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP WITH WASHINGTON
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Beijing,  Sept. 26 (CNA)
(By Huang Chiquan &amp; Eva Chen)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Breaking more than two months of silence
on the subject, a mainland Chinese official reasserted Thursday that
Beijing is seeking a "strategic" relationship with Washington and
that talks on this are continuing.
</P>
<P>
Sheng Guofang, spokesman of mainland China's Foreign Ministry,
observed in response to a CNA reporter's question at a news
conference that Beijing and Washington are discussing the formation
of a kind of strategic partnership that would be an all-around
relationship to include multi-level interaction and dialogue between
heads of both governments.
</P>
<P>
According to informed sources, as early as 1995 mainland China
hoped to establish a kind of strategic partnership with the United
States, but it received no response from Washington at the time.
</P>
<P>
When mainland Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen met with US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in Malaysia
this July, he mentioned for the first time in public that during
mainland President Jiang Zemin's first state visit to Washington in
October, a strategic partnership will be confirmed by both sides.
</P>
<P>
Since Qian's statement, however, neither Beijing nor the mainland
Chinese news media mentioned the partnership again. Only the US side
occasionally brought up the subject.
</P>
<P>
Sheng said that the two sides had reached a mutual understanding
on the relationship and that this would be on the agenda during
Jiang's US visit.

<P>
The United States will brief Taiwan on
the newly revised US-Japan defense cooperation guidelines, a senior
American official said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kurt Cambell, deputy assistant secretary of defense in charge of
Asia-Pacific security affairs, said at a roundtable meeting sponsored
by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington,
D.C., that the United States is obligated to brief Taiwan on any
changes in the security environment in the Asia-Pacific region in
accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act.
</P>
<P>
Cambell said American and Taiwan officials will discuss the
content of the new US-Japan security cooperation guidelines during
their routine meeting in the near future, adding that the two sides
will take advantage of the occasion to review a range of issues of
mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Transparency is very important in reviewing the new US-Japan
security cooperation guidelines, Cambell noted.
</P>
<P>
He further said that as long as the two sides have a lucid mutual
understanding and the Taiwan Relations Act and the three US-mainland
Chinese joint communiques remain unchanged, Taiwan will benefit from
strategic contacts and some strategic dialogue between Washington and
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Cambell said he thinks the United States, while engaging mainland
China, should convey this message to the Taipei leadership.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Relations Act is a US law governing exchanges with
Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic ties.

ARMY EXPLAINS MILITARY PROCUREMENT REFORMS

<P>
In line with the reform of military
procurement, Army General Headquarters announced Friday that its new
procurement department will be responsible for purchases worth between
NT$50,000 and NT$30 million (US$1,750-US$1.08 million) and that it
will step up monitoring of the process.
</P>
<P>
Major General Huang Ping-lin, chief of the general staff of the
Army Logistics Command, will supervise the procurement department.
</P>
<P>
Huang introduced the new approach to the public, vowing a "fair,
open and transparent" system to ease misgivings about irregularities
in military procurement.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to over 100 manufacturers of military goods, Huang
explained the operation of the new procurement department, which was
established July 1 in response to complaints from manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Huang said the department will be in charge of procurement for 58
Army units and that it will help streamline army procurement
procedures and avoid disputes.
</P>
<P>
In emergency cases, however, the units can bypass the procurement
department for purchases between NT$50,000 and NT$500,000
(US$1,800-US$18,000), he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chia-chun, director of the new department, said procurement
operations directly influence the army's combat readiness, and he
expressed the hope that the reforms will help the army get the best
military goods with an efficient use of the budget.

AMCHAM CRITICIZES TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC POLICY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Sept.  25  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The American Chamber of Commerce
(AmCham) in Taipei unveiled its 1997-98 Taiwan White Paper here on
Thursday, in which it criticized Taiwan's economic policy,
particularly its policy on attracting foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper also blamed Taiwan's leadership for focusing
attention on winning international recognition rather than on
practical, basic domestic economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
The 51-page White Paper was released at a news conference held at
the Foreign Press Club in Washington, D.C., which marked the end of a
"doorknocking" visit to the United States by a group of Taiwan-based
American business executives led by AmCham President Jeffrey R.
Williams.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper said continued frosty relations across the Taiwan
Strait is the major reason behind the lingering pessimism among
foreign investors in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Noting that cross-strait relations are critical to Taiwan's
future economic development, the White Paper said the Republic of
China government doesn't seem to be facing up to this reality.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper pointed out that Taiwan's restrictions on
cross-strait trade and investment have not only hindered the
development of its own industries but have also discouraged
multinational business groups from setting up a foothold on the
island. On the other hand, the ROC government encourages its own
business people to invest in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Williams told the news conference that the ROC government's "no
haste, be patient" policy on cross-strait investment is a negative
indicator to gauge Taiwan's future economic prospects. The policy is
only succeeding in prompting Taiwan companies to invest in the
mainland through underground channels, he claimed, adding that the
ROC government's plan to develop Taiwan into an Asia-Pacific
operations center will remain a pipe-dream if Taiwan companies cannot
easily and directly enter the vast mainland market and obtain access
to its resources.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper went on to say that some of Taiwan's policies on
foreign investment are inconceivable. For one thing, it said, Taiwan
remains a high tax-rate country, with its tax rate on
foreign-invested export processing companies exceeding that of Hong
Kong by 240 percent. Moreover, it takes two to three weeks for a
foreign investor to set up a company in Taiwan and more than three
months to set up a subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper further said Taiwan's current economic reforms
will not necessarily succeed, citing the privatization of its
state-run enterprises as an example. The issue has again been put on
the government agenda after having been shelved for some time, but
the program may be halted yet again due to interference by special
interest groups.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper complained that water shortages and power
blackouts are common, even in Taiwan's much-touted high-tech
stronghold -- the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park.
</P>
<P>
It said that although US management guru Michael Porter has
suggested that Taiwan focus on developing cutting-edge
high-technology industries, Taiwan's economic policy planners have
not moved in this direction and are instead planning to set up an
"offshore export processing zone" to accommodate some sunset
industries which have already relocated to mainland China and other
areas.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper also said many foreign investors are disappointed
at the ROC government's low administrative efficiency, excessive red
tape and a lack of a comprehensive, updated legal framework to ensure
smooth business operations.
</P>
<P>
In the face of uncertainty in Taiwan's economic prospects, the
White Paper said, American business people with interests in Taiwan
earnestly hope that the ROC government will seek faster, more
profound economic liberalization and closer cross-strait ties.
</P>
<P>
Williams also said at the news conference that AmCham has
conducted an opinion survey of its 870 members about their views of
the prospects for Taiwan's ambitious Asia-Pacific operations center
development plan.
</P>
<P>
Of the 178 members who responded to the poll, only 4.5 percent
said they are optimistic about the plan. Thirty-seven percent said
they only have limited confidence in the program and 45 percent said
they do not have any concrete investment plans to help improve
Taiwan's prospects of becoming a regional business hub.
</P>
<P>
AmCham has sent a "doorknocking" mission to Washington annually
since 1994 to lobby for the interests of American-invested companies
in Taiwan. Williams said one of the AmCham delegation's major
purposes this year is to enlist US support for Taiwan's early entry
to the World Trade Organization.

<P>
Chances are slim that the smoky haze
emanating from the forest fires currently raging in Indonesia will
affect Taiwan, officials from the Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA) said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, the officials added that the EPA will continue to
monitor the situation closely.
</P>
<P>
They urged Taiwan travelers bound for Indonesia, Singapore and
Malaysia to pay special attention to the air quality in the region
and to take sensible precautions against the effects of the choking
haze which is causing a surge in respiratory ailments across huge
areas of Southeast.
</P>
<P>
The haze is unlikely to pose a threat to Taiwan's air quality in
the foreseeable future, as Taiwan's seasonal northeasterly wind is
due to begin soon, which will help maintain the island's normal air
quality, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
An EPA observation station in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, will
continue to monitor the air flow affecting Taiwan from the south,
enabling the EPA to offer ample warnings to residents if necessary,
they added.

M'LAND CHINA'S CAPITALISM EXAGGERATED: EDITORIAL

San Francisco, Sept. 25 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite bold reforms announced last
week at the 15th congress of the Communist Party of China, it is a
long march to private enterprise, free markets and a modern banking
system, the San Francisco Examiner said Thursday in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
Mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin told the 15th Party
Congress that the government would allow the privatization of tens of
thousands of state-owned industries. Admitting that Jiang's
declaration is a hopeful sign that the economic reforms instituted by
Deng Xiaoping will continue, the editorial said, however, that
reports of the rise of capitalism in mainland China have been
exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's privatization plan exempts 1,000 of the largest state
factories in key industries such as petrochemicals,
telecommunications and high-tech electronics, the Examiner noted. But
the editorial wondered who would buy the remaining firms, most of
which are over-staffed, inefficient and heavily in debt.
</P>
<P>
Mainland China also shows scant respect for the rule of law, a
major concern of foreign investors, who are also deterred by
protectionism, red tape and central control, it added.

Australia is willing to provide
fire-fighting and humanitarian help to Indonesia, as the pall of
pollution fed by forest fires has spread from Indonesia into southern
Thailand after already affecting neighboring Malaysia and Singapore.
</P>

Australia is gearing up to provide assistance to Indonesia
following a meeting in Jakarta on Wednesday between the Indonesian
Environment Minister Sarwono and aid donors from around the world.
</P>

Australian officials said they were waiting for a request from
Indonesia so that they could take action.

The smoke haze has moved across Thailand's southern peninsula,
hitting the resort island of Phuket and other coastal tourist sites.
</P>
<P>
The pollution has reduced visibility in the area to an average of
less than 1.5 km and forced the cancellation on Thursday of flights
into the provincial cities of Surat Thani and Ranong, Australian
weather officials reported.

<P>
They warned that the crisis was likely to worsen in the coming
days, with winds blowing smoke from forest fires burning out of
control off the Indonesian island of Sumatra to the south-west.
</P>

A state of emergency has been declared in Malaysia's Sarawak,

investment.
</P>
<P>
As mainland China remains hostile toward Taiwan and refuses to
resume cross-strait dialogue, the officials said, the ROC govenrment
must take national security into consideration and cannot
fully liberalize mainland-bound investment at the moment.
</P>
<P>
The officials further said Taiwan has taken many positive steps
to boost economic and financial liberalization with a view to
developing the island into an Asia-Pacific regional operations
center.
</P>
<P>
According to official tallies, mainland China-bound investments
amounted to US$770 million in the first seven months of this year,
only slightly lower than US$790 million recorded in the smae period
of last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, foreign investment in Taiwan reached US$2.96 billion
between January and August, up 128 percent as compared with the
year-earlier level. The growth rate was a new record, which
indicated that Taiwan's efforts to improve its investment climate
has paid off and that foreign investors have not lost their
confidence in Taiwan's economic prospects.
</P>
<P>
The officials further said foreign investors can now obtain
corporate licenses within 24 hours if the amount of their investment
projects falls below NT$200 million each and the item they want to
invest is on the government-approved list.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the officials said Taiwan has offered a
five-year tax break to foreign investors in high-technology
industries.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the AMCham should not have compared Taiwan's
tax rates with Hong Kong's because Hong Kong is a world-renowned tax
haven.

ITEM TWENTY-SIX: DEATH TOLL FROM CPC EXPLOSION RISES TO 11

<TEXT>
<P>
A woman seriously injured in a huge gas
explosion which occurred on Sept. 13 in the southern Taiwan city of
Kaohsiung Friday died, bringing to 11 the death toll from the
accident.
</P>
<P>
Liou Chin-hsiou, who suffered burns to 90 percent of her body,
succumbed to complications from her injuries in the Army 806th
Hospital on Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
The blast occurred at 9:13 a.m. Sept. 13, when workers from the
China Petroleum Corp. (CPC) were attempting to move a gas pipe as
part of a road-widening project in the southern port city. The
careless workers failed to check that the pipe had been purged of gas
before cutting it, leading to a series of three huge explosions.
</P>
<P>
Three people were killed outright, while 22 were rushed to
hospitals in the area for treatment. Fourteen people are still
hospitalized, some of whom are still listed in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
The CPC has already agreed to compensation claims from the
families of the victims -- a CPC record high of NT$11 million for
each death. The accident prompted the resignation on Sept. 17 of CPC
chairman S.J. Lee, who said that he had to take responsibility for
the mishap, while other CPC officials are also likely to receive
punishment.

ITEM TWENTY-EIGHT: AMCHAM CRITICIZES TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC POLICY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  Sept.  25  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The American Chamber of Commerce
(AmCham) in Taipei unveiled its 1997-98 Taiwan White Paper here on
Thursday, in which it criticized Taiwan's economic policy,
particularly its policy on attracting foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper also blamed Taiwan's leadership for focusing
attention on winning international recognition rather than on
practical, basic domestic economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
The 51-page White Paper was released at a news conference held at
the Foreign Press Club in Washington, D.C., which marked the end of a
"doorknocking" visit to the United States by a group of Taiwan-based
American business executives led by AmCham President Jeffrey R.
Williams.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper said continued frosty relations across the Taiwan
Strait is the major reason behind the lingering pessimism among
foreign investors in Taiwan. Noting that cross-strait relations are
critical to Taiwan's future economic development, the White Paper
said the Republic of China government doesn't seem to be facing up to
this reality.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper pointed out that Taiwan's restrictions on
cross-strait trade and investment have not only hindered the
development of its own industries but have also discouraged
multinational business groups from setting up a foothold on the
island. On the other hand, the ROC government encourages its own
business people to invest in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Williams told the news conference that the ROC government's "no
haste, be patient" policy on cross-strait investment is a negative
indicator to gauge Taiwan's future economic prospects. The policy is
only succeeding in prompting Taiwan companies to invest in the
mainland through underground channels, he claimed, adding that the
ROC government's plan to develop Taiwan into an Asia-Pacific
operations center will remain a pipe-dream if Taiwan companies cannot
easily and directly enter the vast mainland market and obtain access
to its resources.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper went on to say that some of Taiwan's policies on
foreign investment are inconceivable. For one thing, it said, Taiwan
remains a high tax-rate country, with its tax rate on
foreign-invested export processing companies exceeding that of Hong
Kong by 240 percent. Moreover, it takes two to three weeks for a
foreign investor to set up a company in Taiwan and more than three
months to set up a subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper further said Taiwan's current economic reforms
will not necessarily succeed, citing the privatization of its
state-run enterprises as an example. The issue has again been put on
the government agenda after having been shelved for some time, but
the program may be halted yet again due to interference by special
interest groups.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper complained that water shortages and power
blackouts are common, even in Taiwan's much-touted high-tech
stronghold -- the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park. It said that
although US management guru Michael Porter has suggested that Taiwan
focus on developing cutting-edge high-technology industries, Taiwan's
economic policy planners have not moved in this direction and are
instead planning to set up an "offshore export processing zone" to
accommodate some sunset industries which have already relocated to
mainland China and other areas.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper also said many foreign investors are disappointed
at the ROC government's low administrative efficiency, excessive red
tape and a lack of a comprehensive, updated legal framework to ensure
smooth business operations. In the face of uncertainty in Taiwan's
economic prospects, the White Paper said, American business people
with interests in Taiwan earnestly hope that the ROC government will
seek faster, more profound economic liberalization and closer
cross-strait ties.
</P>
<P>
Williams also said at the news conference that AmCham has
conducted an opinion survey of its 870 members about their views of
the prospects for Taiwan's ambitious Asia-Pacific operations center
development plan.
</P>
<P>
Of the 178 members who responded to the poll, only 4.5 percent
said they are optimistic about the plan. Thirty-seven percent said
they only have limited confidence in the program and 45 percent said
they do not have any concrete investment plans to help improve
Taiwan's prospects of becoming a regional business hub.
</P>
<P>
AmCham has sent a "doorknocking" mission to Washington annually
since 1994 to lobby for the interests of American-invested companies
in Taiwan. Williams said one of the AmCham delegation's major
purposes this year is to enlist US support for Taiwan's early entry
to the World Trade Organization.

ITEM TWENTY-NINE: LOCAL PRESS COMMENT ON US-JAPAN DEFENSE TREATY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  26  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The following are excerpts from an
editorial carried in Friday's edition of local English-language daily
The China Post.
</P>
<P>
The US-Japan Defense Treaty
</P>
<P>
Taiwan and other security-conscious members of the Asian and
Pacific communities all have reason to extend a warm welcome to the
revised US-Japan defense guidelines, as the new bilateral documents
oblige the two allies to effect closer cooperation to help ensure
peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
A key point of the new alliance agreement... is a US commitment
to maintain its military presence in Asia.
</P>
<P>
What is new is that the updated pact requires Washington and
Tokyo to take joint action when potential aggression or emergency
occurs in "areas surrounding" Japan.
</P>
<P>
The role required for Japan under such circumstances, however,
will be non-combative.
</P>
<P>
In order not to provoke opposition to the expansion of the new
defense treaty's scope of application to the areas surrounding Japan,
Washington and Tokyo took pains to avoid mention in the pact of any
specific areas or where an armed aggression might come from.
</P>
<P>
Still, mainland China has taken strong exception to the new
US-Japan defense treaty. From the viewpoint of Beijing, the 1978
defense guidelines were revised this time with mainland China as the
major objective, or mainly for the purpose of containing the
communist Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
In the view of Beijing leaders, the new defense treaty's widened
scope of application obviously includes Taiwan, an island to which
the US already has a security commitment.
</P>
<P>
The question of the perceived inclusion of Taiwan in the defense
pact's application does not seem to be the only reason for Beijing
opposition to the agreement. Mainland China, with its increasing
economic and military strength, may see America's enhanced military
cooperation with Japan as a threat to its goal of achieving dominance
in regional affairs.

ITEM THIRTY: ECONOMIC  REFORMS  BOOST  POOR  NATIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva,  Sept.  26  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Successful implementation of economic
reforms has set some of the world's poorest countries on the path of
sustainable growth, according to a report from the Geneva-based
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD said in its annual report on the 48 least-developed
countries that on average, the least-developed countries (LDCs) grew
4.7 percent last year, down from 5.2 percent in 1995 but still
"relatively robust."
</P>
<P>
The slowdown reflects lower growth for the 33 African LDCs in
1996, attributed by UNCTAD to falling commodity prices and declining
aid flows. Some 19 African LDCs have nevertheless had growth rates in
excess of 4 percent since 1994, a substantial improvement on the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
"There is reason to be cautiously optimistic about the prospects
for the majority of the LDCs," the annual UNCTAD report said. Steady
global economic expansion this year and the current sharp rise in
prices of tropical beverages such as coffee and cocoa are seen as
favorable factors, but UNCTAD said successfully implemented economic
reforms are proving at least as important.

<P>
The Investigation Bureau said that they
have arrested a man in Taichung, central Taiwan, for offering
firearms for sale through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
An Investigation Bureau task force on Wednesday arrested the
suspect, identified as Lin Wen-yi, 41, the one-time owner of an
unsuccessful computer consultation company.
</P>
<P>
Lin admitted that he set up his website, entitled "Godfather of
Firearms," late last year, but denied that he has ever struck any
actual arms deals with Internet users since the website was
established.
</P>
<P>
Lin's website claimed that he had a variety of handguns available
for purchase. A .38 caliber Italian-made Beretta Tomcat handgun, for
instance, carried a price tag of US$2,500.
</P>
<P>
"I had no firearms to sell. I just wanted to show off," Lin told
investigating agents, adding that between 30,000 and 40,000 Internet
users have visited his website.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that he copied an English-language arms sales
advertisement already on the Internet and posted it on his own
website after having it translated it into Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Lin was sent to Taipei Prosecutors Office on Thursday night,
where he remains in custody, unable to come up with NT$200,000 bail
money.

At least four Taiwan nationals are

flight from Jakarta to Medan had 234 people on board, including a
crew of 12.
</P>
<P>
No one is believed to have survived the crash, which early
reports said may have been caused by the smoke generated by numerous
forest fires in Indonesia which have shrouded a huge area of

ITEM THIRTY-FOUR: EDUCATION  ADVOCATES  PREDICT  LARGE  TURNOUT  FOR SATURDAY PROTEST
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  26  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 400,000 teachers and students
islandwide will join a one-day strike on Saturday called by
educational reform groups to protest the government's decision to
strike down a constitutional safeguard of the education budget, a
strike organizer said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Shih Yin, leader of an umbrella group formed for what he termed
"saving the budget of education, science and culture," said that
protest marches called for in all Taiwan's major cities are expected
to attract more than 70,000 participants.
</P>
<P>
Shih, who beat a drum in front of the Ministry of Education
office on Friday afternoon to signify the beginning of the movement,
told reporters that more than 200,000 people have signed petitions
supporting the group's cause, in addition to hundreds of schools
which have agreed to skip regular classes to hold "outdoor teaching
sessions" or take part in the protest rallies.
</P>
<P>
The march in Taipei, to be led by National Taiwan University
professors and Huang Wu-hsing, another education reform group leader,
is expected to attract about 40,000 people, with another 30,000
marching in Kaohsiung, said Shih.
</P>
<P>
Taipei's marchers will comprise education-conscious parents and
children, teachers and members of education groups, said Shih. But,
he added, in order to underline the campaign's non-partisan nature,
no politicians have been invited to take part.
</P>
<P>
The protesters are infuriated by the government's decision,
approved by the National Assembly in July, to repeal a constitutional
provision which stipulates that the annual budget for education,
science and culture should not be less than 15 percent of the
government's total annual expenditure.
</P>
<P>
They claim the government's move belies its promise to upgrade
national education, despite the government's oft-repeated pledge that
the educational budget will not actually be cut, even though the
constitutional safeguard no longer exists.
</P>
<P>
In a vain attempt to defuse Saturday's strike and demonstration,
the Executive Yuan called a press conference on Friday morning to
reiterate the government's promise.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Education Wu Jing said at the press conference that
he appreciates the reform groups' support for the education budget,
but frowns on the strike call, especially the strike by teachers
which, he said, will set an inappropriate example for students.
</P>
<P>
Although Wu said "it is beyond doubt" that he will step down, as
some critics demand, if he fails to persuade the Legislative Yuan to
bring in new laws to safeguard the education budget, he expressed
doubt that his quitting will be of any value, since his superiors,
Premier Vincent Siew and President Lee Teng-hui, have already
promised to push for legislation in this regard.

Sheu Kesheng, vice chairman of the
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said on Friday that the criticism of
the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) against Taipei's "no haste,
be patient" policy towards ROC investment in mainland China is mainly
"from a businessman's standpoint."
</P>
<P>
Sheu was commenting on the Taiwan White Paper released by AmCham

island into an Asia-Pacific operations hub remain no more than a
pipe-dream.
</P>

He explained that the policy is an all-round one based on the
state of current cross-strait relations and that it will continue to
be implemented by the government, pointing out that Taiwan's
cross-strait policy has already been clearly laid out by the Taipei
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Responding to questions as to whether the resumption of
cross-strait dialogue could be deemed as a prerequisite to adjusting
the "no haste, be patient" policy, Sheu said there is "no premise for
adjusting this policy."

Belize Prime Minister Manuel Esquivel
visited the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) on Saturday to
exchange views with officials there on ways to strengthen economic
and trade exchanges between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Esquivel, who concurrently serves as finance and trade minister,
urged Taiwan businesses to invest in his Central American country.
Belize boasts one of the best investment havens on the Caribbean
seaboard and is a Caribbean Basin Incentives (CBI) beneficiary
country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's state-run Taiwan Sugar Corp. and the Industrial
Development and Investment Center under the MOEA are slated to send
officials to Belize on fact-finding trips in October, Esquivel noted.
</P>
<P>
According to Vice Economics Minister Chang Chang-pang, Belize, as
a CBI beneficiary country, offers financial and development
incentives to foreign investors. It keenly welcomes foreign capital
to pump up its infrastructure, basic industries, agricultural and
travel sectors, he said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan investment in Belize has not been fairly significant to
date, worth only some US$20.63 million, Chang noted. A great majority
of this has gone into land and real estate development, with some of
it channeled into garment processing, construction materials,
plastics, foodstuffs, stationery and furniture manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
Some Taiwan real estate developers in Belize have also
transferred their investments to farms and orchard operations, he

Swaziland's King Mswati III called on

</P>
<P>
King Mswati III made the call in a speech given in the general

The UN adopted in 1971 the resolution that has the effect today

<P>
The government and people of the ROC have made enormous advances

themselves ready and able to share their experience and advice with
all the nations of the world, he indicated.
</P>
<P>
Many countries and political groupings over the years have also
recognized the need to involve the ROC in global development
activities through the offices of the UN and its agencies, he
continued.

"The time has come to review the resolution of 26 years ago. We

<TEXT>
<P>
President Lee Teng-hui on Saturday said he
hopes to be a pioneer leading Taiwan businessmen in an exploration of
the vast Central and South American markets and to accelerate
bilateral ties between the ROC and that part of the world.
</P>
<P>
In a brief meeting with Belize Prime Minister Manuel Esquivel at
the Presidential Office on Saturday, Lee said he was encouraged to
find during his recent visit to Central and South America that
countries there have become more stable politically and are focusing
attention on economic development, which invites foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Lee said his visit to the region also served as a "shot in the
arm" for Taiwan businesses interested in investing in that part of
the world, urging them to strike while the iron is hot.
</P>
<P>
Esquivel, who made a side-trip to Taipei from Hong Kong after
attending the general annual meeting of the World Bank there,
congratulated Lee on his recent Latin American tour, which he said
has propelled bilateral ROC-Latin America ties into a new era.

Around 15,000 Turkish troops and more than

A total of seven passengers from Taiwan
were among the 234 victims on board the Indonesian Garuda Airlines
passenger jet which crashed on Friday, a Foreign Ministry official
said on Saturday, while 18 family members of the Taiwan victims and
four local employees of Garuda Airlines set off for Indonesia to
claim the remains of their loved ones.

Family members told the CNA that they are hoping Taiwan's
representative office in Indonesia will help them bring home remains.
</P>
<P>
The Garuda Airbus 300 on a domestic flight from Jakarta came down
on Friday afternoon during its approach to the town of Medan on the
western Indonesian island of Sumatra, possibly as a result of poor
visibility due to the thick haze from forest and brush fires
deliberately set on by Indonesian farmers which has enveloped huge
areas of Southeast Asia in a choking shroud of smog.

The flight had 222 passengers on board, including two infants and

there are still differences in social systems, level of economic

<P>
International tourists from Taiwan,
Japan, South Korea, Indonesia and Malaysia have criticized
restrictions on shopping hours in Australia and want them removed so
that they can shop during the night, according to the Tourism Council
of Australia (TCA).
</P>
<P>
TCA Managing Director Bruce Baird told reporters this week that
trading hours should be dictated by market demand.

"Shopping is the number one activity for international visitors

retail goods and services," he said.

Restrictions on shopping hours exist in the states of New South
Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania.

The bureau said those who complain most about shop trading hours
were tourists from Taiwan, Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia.

Baird said visitors from Asia prefer to do their sightseeing in

ROC ECONOMY CONTINUES TO EXPAND STEADILY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 27 (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's economy continued to flash a safe
"green light" in August, signaling that the domestic economy is
growing steadily, the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It is the tenth consecutive month that the local economy has
received a "green" rating on the CEPD five-color scale for stable
growth, the CEPD said.
</P>
<P>
The composite index of economic performance received a score of
26 points in August, down four points from July, indicating that the
economy continues to gain momentum, albeit at a slower pace, said
CEPD Economic Research Department Director Thomas Yeh.
</P>
<P>
The CEPD uses a five-color rating system to measure the country's
economic performance. A red light means the economy is overheated; a
yellow-red light indicates the economy is heating up; a green light
reflects steady growth; a yellow-blue rating signals an economic
slowdown; and a blue light represents an economic recession.
</P>
<P>
Ratings are determined according to nine major economic
indicators: export value, new export orders, industrial production,
manufacturing inventories, total employment outside the agricultural
sector, money supply, stock prices, the check default rate and bank
lending to the private sector. The minimum score for a healthy
"green" rating is 23 points.
</P>
<P>
During the month of August, the nine indicators showed mixed
performances. Among production-related indicators, industrial
production, total employment outside the agricultural sector and new
export orders remained at the same levels as the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing inventories surged to a green light from the
yellow-blue of an economic slowdown, while the export value dropped
from July's rise of 14.2 percent to an negative growth of 0.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
In the financial sector, money supply, bank lending and stock
prices remained unchanged from July, while the check default rate
dropped.
</P>
<P>
In all, August's leading indicators dropped 0.8 percent from July
to 104.4, a sign that domestic economic prospects over the next three
to five months are unclear, said Yeh. The figure is based on an
indictor of 100 in 1991.

STUDENTS AND TEACHERS PROTEST OVER EDUCATION BUDGET

<P>
Some 5,000 students and teachers skipped
regular classes on Saturday morning to attend an "outdoor teaching
session" at Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall as part of protests over the
abolition of the constitutional safeguard of the government's
education budget.
</P>
<P>
At 9:00 a.m., students from primary schools, junior and senior
high schools arrived at the plaza in front of the memorial hall,
where organizers had arranged 54 teaching booths covering the fields
of mathematics, computer science, sculpture, drama, music, dance,
poetry and folk arts for the students to attend. There were also
performances by six artistic groups.
</P>
<P>
"This was not a strike, just a different kind of teaching and
learning," organizers of the "saving education budget front" said,
adding that the students and teachers were fighting for the right to
be educated and the education budget.
</P>
<P>
"We are disappointed that Wu Jin, Minister of Education, failed
to appear on this special occasion to show his concern over the
quality of Taiwan's education," said Shih Ying, a renowned education
reform leader and one of the event's organizers.
</P>
<P>
Shih said that besides the activities at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial
Hall, some one million students and teachers around the island quit
their regular classes for another form of teaching on Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, some 10,000 people took to the streets in
Taipei to express their anger over the government's decision to do
away with the constitutional safeguard of the education budget. The
demonstrators, led by National Taiwan University Professor Huang
Wu-hsing, marched from the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall to the
Presidential Office in downtown Taipei. A similar march in Kaohsiung
attracted an estimated 30,000 protesters.
</P>
<P>
The constitutional provision which stipulates that the annual
budget for education, science and culture should not be less than 15
percent of the government's total annual expenditure was repealed in
the last National Assembly session.

Allegations that mainland China's Vice
Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen will visit Panama are only a
rumor, said ROC Vice Premier and Foreign Minister John Chang on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chang said Taipei is closely monitoring diplomatic relations and
situations among all the ROC's allies, adding that earlier meetings
between Qian and his Panamanian and Paraguayan counterparts during
recent United Nations gatherings are matters Taipei knew of well in
advance.
</P>

Chang said the governments of both Panama and Paraguay notified
Taipei in advance about those meetings, which focused only on
bilateral economic and trade relations.

Panama and Paraguay's stances on continuing diplomatic relations
with the ROC are unwavering and crystal-clear, he said.

Chang said Taipei fully understands Panama's and Paraguay's need
to have contact with mainland Chinese officials, as several
controversial issues between those two countries and mainland China
remained to be solved.
</P>
<P>
Nor does Taipei intend to interfere with mainland China's
sponsoring of trade shows in Panama either, he noted, as the two
countries maintain economic relations.

As for political activities, such as the "Oct. 1 National Day"
activities which Beijing is rumored to be planning to stage in Panama

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two British reports on eating red meat
have sparked a row between health and agricultural interests in
Australia and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Mass circulation newspaper The Sydney Morning Herald on Saturday
reported that a British government committee has recommended that
those who eat an average of 90 grams of red meat a day should
consider reducing their intake, while those eating around 140 grams
should definitely cut back.
</P>
<P>
But publication of the report was stopped following the
intervention of the British Agricultural Ministry, the daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics said the apparent average per
capita consumption of red meat in Australia in 1993-94 was 79.8
kilos, or 218 grams daily.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Meat and Livestock Corp. (AMLC) meanwhile
criticized another British report, this one by the World Cancer
Research Fund, which makes similar recommendations for lower red meat
intake.
</P>
<P>
The AMCL cited a recent review by the Commonwealth Scientific and
Industrial Research Organization in Australia which concluded there
was no consistent connection between red meat consumption and cancer.
</P>
<P>
Australia is one of the major red meat exporters, selling beef to
many countries, including Taiwan, Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Prominent Australian nutritionist Rosemary Stanton said she
questioned the independence of the British report.

ROC Vice Premier and Foreign Minister John
Chang said on Saturday that he regrets the criticism by the American
Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Taipei of Taiwan's economic policy in
its just-released 1997-98 Taiwan White Paper.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA),
Chang said he thinks AmCham fails to understand Taiwan's economic
policy, especially the necessity of its "no haste, be patient" policy
on cross-strait investment.
</P>
<P>
He also commented that the United States was not the proper place
to unveil the White Paper, adding that if Amcham has any difference
of opinion on ROC policy, they can communicate directly with the ROC
government at any time.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister stressed that it is very important at the
moment for the ROC government to maintain the nation's security, as
this is the only way the country can survive in the international
community.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Chang said, security and survival are the two major
facets of ROC government policy in every field, including the
economy.
</P>
<P>
"If we cannot survive, have no security and enjoy no
international space, American businesses will not be able to make any
profit here." Chang said.

AmCham unveiled the 51-page White Paper in Washington, D.C. on

attention on winning international recognition rather than on

TAIWAN TRADE MISSION TO VISIT JAPAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Taiwan trade mission, organized by the
semi-official China External Trade Development Council (CETRA), will
leave for Japan Tuesday to promote sales to Japanese hypermarkets.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time so far this year that CETRA has organized
a Taiwan trade delegation to explore Japan's growing hypermart
markets.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, composed of 77 senior executives from 52 Taiwan
companies, will visit Tokyo, Nigata, Sendai, Aomori, Hokkaido and
many other Japanese cities to seek possible trade deals with large
Japanese hypermarts.
</P>
<P>
A CETRA official said on Sunday that the CETRA liaison office in
Japan had interviewed many Japanese hypermart operators about their
procurement plans before it finalized the group's itinerary in order
to ensure the success of the Sept. 30-Oct. 9 trade promotional visit.
</P>
<P>
Through these initial contacts, the official said, two large
Japanese hypermarts -- Homak and Komeri -- have asked 16 Taiwan
companies to quote prices for a number of consumer products before
the group starts its Japan trip.
</P>
<P>
The official said many Japanese hypermart operators have
increased direct purchases from abroad in recent years as part of
their efforts to cut operational costs and raise profits. "This has
provided a good opportunity for local manufacturers to make inroads
into the Japanese market and help narrow Taiwan's trade imbalance
with Japan," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the CETRA-organized Japanese hypermart
trade promotion visit earlier this year, which took the group to
Osaka and other major cities in western Japan, was highly successful.
The group won many orders during that visit and also managed to
prompt Japan's Sumaki hypermart to decide to send a procurement
mission to Taiwan in mid-October, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan has increased further this year
because of dwindling exports caused by an epidemic of foot-and-mouth
disease that hit Taiwan's pig population this spring. The epidemic
prompted Japan to ban imports of Taiwan pork.

island's high tax rates and alleged low administrative efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Wang said on Saturday that related government agencies should
review the criticism and try to further ease restrictions on the
screening of foreign investment and registration.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the process of screening foreign investment, Wang said
that at present, foreign investments under NT$200 million (US$7
million) take no more than two days to evaluate and that those over
that amount could be fully processed in just one or two weeks. This
pace rivals that of the United States and many advanced nations in
Europe, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
On AmCham's complaints of lengthy registration for setting up a
company in Taiwan, Wang explained that many industries -- such as
banking, insurance and travel -- have had to get special approval to
operate here, so that it takes longer for companies in these fields
to register.
</P>
<P>
But he also said that the government will try to further ease the
restrictions to create a more relaxed investment environment for
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
On AmCham's criticism of the government's "exercise restraint
against haste" policy in investing in mainland China, Wang said that
many countries set restrictions on their rivals, citing the US
embargo of Cuba as an example. In view of the hostile attitude of
Beijing and that cross-strait dialogue has not resumed, such a policy
is necessary, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the government's "no haste" policy aims to prevent
businesses from focusing too much of their investment in mainland
China and to reduce Taiwan investment in major mainland
infrastructure projects. But small and medium-sized investments in
mainland China will not be restricted, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the ministry will communicate with the United States on
this aspect to try to dissolve the misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
On whether Taiwan's trade opportunities would be affected by
mainland President Jiang Zemin bringing along a list of orders with
him on his trip to the United States next month for his meeting with
US President Bill Clinton, Wang said that mainland China is only
one of the competitive rivals of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan has its own advantages and disadvantages
compared with mainland China, he said Taipei's focus should be on
improving the domestic economic structure and upgrading the island's
competitive edge.

MONEY POLITICS &amp; ORGANIZED CRIME DISCOURAGE INVESTMENT: POLL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  28  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Money-linked politics and organized
crime" is the top non-economic factor to affect domestic investment
willingness, according to a recent opinion survey of local business
executives.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese National Federation of Industries (CNFI), one of
Taiwan's largest trade associations, sent 378 questionnaires to its
members early this month in an attempt to understand local business
people's views on the domestic political and economic climate
following the inauguration of Premier Vincent Siew's new cabinet. The
federation received 86 valid replies, or 22.8 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Survey results found that "money politics and organized crime" is
the most serious non-economic factor to discourage local industry
executives from investing at home (85 percent).
</P>
<P>
Other non-economic considerations cited by the respondents
include the parliament's legislative efficiency and general legal
regulations (82 percent); domestic political stability (76 percent);
the government's administrative efficiency (73 percent); and
relations across the Taiwan Strait (53 percent).
</P>
<P>
CNFI officials said the survey findings indicate that the three
unsolved high-profile criminal cases and the involvement in organized
crime by some elected representatives have made local business people
worried about the threat of underworld gangs to the safety of
themselves and their property.
</P>
<P>
Domestic industry executives are also concerned about political
graft and the involvement in politics by criminal gangs which they
say will hinder administrative reforms and result in uneven, unfair
distribution of economic resources, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
The poll also showed that local business people now pay less
regard to cross-strait relations in drafting their new domestic
investment projects.
</P>
<P>
This also indicates that continued growth in cross-strait
commercial exchanges and the inauguration of direct cross-strait
transshipping services have prompted local business and industry
executives to more calmly and rationally look at some longstanding
cross-strait disputes, the CNFI officials noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, major economic factors that would affect investment
activities include the competitiveness of a specific industry, land
acquisition, labor issues, environmental impact, and infrastructure
construction, in descending order, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
A total of 53 percent of those surveyed said they believe the
government's administrative efficiency will improve in the coming
year; 42 percent said they expect the crime rate and political graft
to decline; but only 28 percent said they believe the parliament's
legislative efficiency will improve.
</P>
<P>
As to the prospects for the improvement of various economic
factors, the poll showed that most respondents believe the general
situation will remain unchanged or improve, except for labor
problems.
</P>
<P>
Asked about how to improve the domestic investment climate, the
respondents said they hope the new Cabinet will give top priority to
stemming the crime rate and improving public order, as well as
maintaining political stability, accelerating infrastructure
construction, updating laws and regulations, liberalizing capital
flow, upgrading legislative efficiency, and eradicating organized
crime and political graft.

<P>
Maryland University intends to confer
an honorary doctorate upon Lien Chan, vice president of the Republic
of China, the president of the university said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
As the current US policy restricts senior ROC officials, such as
the president, vice president, premier and vice premier, to make
official visits to the United States, the head of the university may
need to travel to Taipei to confer the degree in person.
</P>
<P>
Lien Fang-yu, wife of ROC Vice President Lien Chan, visited
Maryland University on Saturday morning to meet with the university's
president and also viewed the valuable Taiwan historical documents
her father-in-law donated to the university's library.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Lien has been in nearby Washington, D.C. on a private visit.
While there, she attended a Chinese cuisine fair and a charity bazaar
at the Twin Oak building, the previous official residence of ROC
ambassador to the US before the two countries severed their

TAIWAN RANKS 17TH IN LIST OF US EXPATRIATE DESTINATIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington, Sept. 27 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan ranks 17th in the list of homes
abroad for some 3.27 million US expatriates, behind only the
Philippines, Japan and Hong Kong in Asia, according to statistics
published by the US State Department.
</P>
<P>
The top three destinations for US expatriates are Canada, Mexico
and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Excluding civil servants stationed abroad (as well as their
family members) and military personnel, there are about 3.27 million
US citizens living abroad, the State Department said. The main
reasons for their residing abroad include doing business, returning
to the land of their ancestors and enjoying a lower cost of living.
</P>
<P>
The State Department said that Canada and Mexico are home to one
third of Americans who settle abroad. In addition, Britain, Israel,
Poland, Italy, the Philippines, France, the Dominican Republic,
Greece, Japan, Australia, Spain and Saudi Arabia also attract large
numbers of US citizens.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong ranks 16th in the list. There are 40,800 US citizens
settled in the "Pearl of the Orient," a crowded and tiny territory
formerly ruled by Britain and now controlled by mainland China.
</P>
<P>
The State Department figures show that the most common US
expatriate destinations in Asia are the Philippines, Japan, Hong
Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and mainland China.
</P>
<P>
The 36,000 US citizens living in Taiwan account for 0.16 percent

NATION MARKS BIRTH ANNIVERSARY OF CONFUCIUS
</HEADLINE>

(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Lee Teng-hui presided over a
ceremony held at the Presidential Office on Sunday in commemoration
of the 2,547th anniversary of the birth of Confucius.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of central and local government officials, including
Vice President Lien Chan, attended the ceremony to commemorate the
birth anniversary of the great Chinese sage.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, Professor Shen Ching-sung of National Chengchi
University delivered a speech on the modern interpretation of
Confucian thought, calling for more attention to the importance of
ethical education in modern society.
</P>
<P>
Early in the morning, a traditional Chinese ritual was held at
the Confucius Temple in Taipei to mark the anniversary of the sage's
birth, with Deputy Taipei Mayor Pai Hsiu-hsiung officiating.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Yeh Chin-feng also attended the rite on behalf
of President Lee. Yeh was the first ROC female politician to
represent the country's head of state to burn incense at the annual
ritual in honor of Confucius.
</P>
<P>
Braving light rain, scores of elementary schoolchildren performed
a ceremonial dance, known as the Six Row Dance, on the shrine's court
to pay tribute to Confucius.
</P>
<P>
As part of its efforts to arouse the public's love and care for
animals, the Taipei City Government offered all-vegetarian
sacrificial foods for the first time at this year's rite. The raw ox,
pig and goat carcasses used to make sacrifices to Confucius in the
past were replaced this year by animals made of glutinous rice.
</P>
<P>
The rite attracted a huge crowd of spectators, including some
foreign residents and a group of Japanese tourists.
</P>
<P>
Similar rites were also held at Confucian shrines in other major
cities around the island. Taiwan Governor James Soong officiated at a
ceremonial rite held at the Confucius Temple in the southern city of
Tainan, which is the oldest Confucian shrine in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
As the Confucian birth anniversary, which falls on Sept. 28, also
marks Teacher's Day, Education Minister Wu Jin paid courtesy visits
to several grass-roots teachers on Sunday to express his respect for
their devotion to their career.
</P>
<P>
Wu first visited the home of Chiu Nien-hung, a teacher at the
Nankang Vocational High School in Taipei. Wu was moved after
listening to Chiu's account of his struggle to complete his college
education and become a vocational school teacher.
</P>
<P>
Wu said teachers are the prime motor of the country's educational
reforms. "I must listen to them to gain inspiration for drawing up
various innovative educational programs," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon, Wu also visited the homes of several elementary
and junior high school teachers in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Wu further said the Ministry of Education will push for
legislation to ensure sufficient government funding for education and
scientific and cultural development projects.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the ministry has sent a draft education basic bill to the
Cabinet for screening. The draft bill will be referred to the
Legislative Yuan for approval. The bill is aimed at ensuring an
annual budget floor for education, Wu said, adding that the
government's current education budget accounts for 5.62 percent of
Taiwan's gross national product. "The ministry will figure out a
suitable percentage for future education budgets," the minister
added.

<P>
The Dalai Lama, the respected Tibetan
spiritual leader, met with a group of Buddhist followers from Taiwan
on Saturday at the seat of the Tibetan government-in-exile in the
northern Indian city of Dharmsala, a spokesman for the Buddhist
Association of the Republic of China reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 200-member delegation, organized by the ROC Buddhist
Association, arrived in Dharmsala on Friday for a good-will visit.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama preached an hourlong sermon for the
delegation, headed by Master Ching Hsin, president of the ROC
Buddhist Association, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Master Ching Hsin met with the Dalai
Lama shortly after his arrival in Dharmsala to discuss practical
measures to boost bilateral cultural exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The two religious leaders also discussed the feasibility of
exchanging Buddhist students and co-sponsoring international
Buddhist conferences, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama and Master Ching Hsin jointly officiated at a
religious ritual Saturday afternoon to pray for world peace. In
addition to members of the ROC delegation, more than 1,000 Tibetan
monks and Buddhist believers in northern India also
attended the rite, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The ROC delegation will visit a Tibetan cultural center,
monasteries and Tibetan refugee camps in Dharmsala and nearby cities
over the next few days. The group is scheduled to return to Taiwan
on Oct. 4.
</P>
<P>
The visit is designed mainly as a response to the Dalai Lama's
unprecedented trip to Taiwan in March this year, which Master Ching
Hsin helped organize, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
During his high-profile visit to Taiwan, the Dalai Lama received
an enthusiastic welcome from local Buddhist followers and met with
President Lee Teng-hui and other senior ROC officials.

SCHOLARS ON CROSS-STRAIT EXCHANGES OVER PAST DECADE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  28  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A scholar said over the weekend that
though Taiwan is incapable of offensive warfare, it is not entirely
at a disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
Kung Ling-cheng, a professor at Tamkang University, made the
remarks at a seminar presided over by Tao Pai-chuan, national policy
advisor to President Lee Teng-hui, on cross-strait exchanges over the
past ten years and their future prospects.
</P>
<P>
Kung noted mainland China will be unable to counterbalance the
United States in the foreseeable future and that Beijing has also
tacitly accepted Washington's role in Asia-Pacific affairs. Unless
Taiwan announces independence, Kung said, mainland China will not
rashly use force against the island.
</P>
<P>
Since Taiwan enjoys the natural protection of being surrounded by
the sea, having a modernized military makes it capable of defensive,
if not offensive warfare, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances, Taiwan is not entirely at a
disadvantage, he said, adding that strategy and the unity of people
on the island are crucial.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Professor Hu Fo of National Taiwan
University said the government has been vague to some extent on the
future development of the nation.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that the reason the ruling Kuomintang and the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party worked together last year at the
National Development Conference, which was designed to chart the
nation's future course, may be attributed to a "Taiwan
consciousness," indicating a "turning back on unification and a tilt
toward independence."
</P>
<P>
Chiu Yi of the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research said
that since Hong Kong excels in financial services, Taiwan prides
itself on its hi-tech industry and mainland China relies heavily on
agricultural and labor-intensive industries, all three would benefit
if they could work together.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the success of Taiwan's Asia-Pacific Regional
Operations Center project hinges on unhindered interchanges between
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. Failing that, he said, the chance
of its success would be slim. Chiu also questioned the government's
"exercise restraint against haste" policy toward mainland investment.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yu-chun, an associate researcher at the Academia Sinica,
lamented the fact that there is no consensus among domestic parties
on a policy toward mainland China, saying that such an agreement is a
necessary basis for dealing successfully with mainland China. Most
political leaders have based their mainland policies on solidifying
their own power bases or trying to win support for their parties, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He urged mainland China not to try to stifle Taiwan's efforts to
take part in international organizations, but he also said he
believes Taipei should not challenge Beijing in the United Nations
and other major international organizations but try to set its
targets at peripheral bodies.

LOCAL BUSINESSMEN INVESTING IN L. AMERICA CAN BENEFIT FROM ZERO DUTY

<P>
Domestic industrial executives, by
investing in Latin America, can take advantage of a "zero tariff"
measure given to goods exported from that region to the United States
to break into the US market, the government's highest agricultural
official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Peng Tso-kwei, chairman of the Council of Agriculture, said that
his council's recently formed Task Force for Cooperation on Central
and South American Agricultural and Fishery Projects will provide
domestic industries with needed assistance on investing in Panama, El
Salvador, Honduras and Paraguay -- all of which maintain diplomatic
ties with the Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Peng said that although domestic industrial executives have not
paid much attention to Latin America's investment climate in the
past, the US policy can allow their products a convenient inroad into
the US market.
</P>
<P>
Chinatrust Commercial Bank has set up branch units in Paraguay
and is preparing a representative office in the Republic of China's
embassy in El Salvador in order to provide more effective loan
services to domestic industrial executives, he noted, adding that the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs will also provide assistance to Taiwan
business people wishing to invest in those two countries, as well as
in Panama and Honduras.
</P>
<P>
Since Latin America has little experience in deep sea fisheries
and this sector needs technological assistance to achieve further
breakthroughs, Taiwan can provide some nations in the region with
related services, Peng added.

CANADA NEEDS STRONGER STAND ON HUMAN RIGHTS: DAILY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Ottawa,  Sept.  27  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As host of this November's APEC leaders
meeting, Canada should make human rights "a very public part of the
agenda," an influential newspaper suggested Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Ottawa Citizen, in an editorial, reminded the Canadian
government that, like people, governments "are better judged on their
actions than on their words."
</P>
<P>
The article listed five points where the Canadian government
could improve its stand on human rights.
</P>
<P>
First, the Citizen said, the Canadian government must not allow
itself to be party to the abuse of another country's citizenry. "Our
tax dollars should not back projects, such as the Three Gorges dam in
China, that stifle citizens' rights," it opined.
</P>
<P>
Second, the government ought not to spend its time courting
dictators, the editorial argued, saying that even if businessmen
fancy the idea of "Team Canada" missions to mainland China, human
rights supporters should revile these.
</P>
<P>
Third, it continued, Canada must not fall awkwardly silent at
international gatherings. The daily criticized Ottawa's failure to
support a UN resolution last spring aimed at condemning Beijing's
poor human rights record.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, the government should rigorously re-examine the ethics
guidelines its agencies use abroad and "set a tone of real
conviction," the daily said.
</P>
<P>
And fifth, the Citizen suggested, the government should refuse to
buy from businesses that do not respect human rights. Citing
Massachusetts' non-procurement policy, it said provinces and cities
could also consider similar "ethical" spending habits.

SOUTH KOREA'S FINANCE OFFER FAILS TO IMPRESS WTO
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva,  Sept.  27  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new proposal by South Korea in the
global talks to liberalize trade in financial services has fallen
short of expectations, according to reports of the Geneva-based World
Trade Organization (WTO) Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Officials from some Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) member countries said they expected South Korea to
come forward with a more sweeping removal of barriers now that the
East Asian nation has graduated to the rich nations club. South Korea
joined the 29-member OECD in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to WTO trade delegates, the South Korean proposal
includes a total of 34 improvements over the proposal it put forward
in the earlier 1995 round of talks.
</P>
<P>
The conditional offer includes increasing the limit on foreign
portfolio investment in stocks of domestic companies listed on South
Korean exchanges from 15 percent to 23 percent for aggregate
horizontal commitments.
</P>
<P>
However, in the cases of Pohang Iron and Steel Corp. and the
Korean Electric Power Corp., foreign investment is limited to a
ceiling of 18 percent, the WTO report said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the offer also increases the amount of stock that can
be held by an individual investor to 6 percent, up from the 1995
level of 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
But foreigners are not allowed to invest in non-listed south
Korean companies.
</P>
<P>
In the area of insurance, the new proposal permits the
establishment of a commercial presence by foreign entities, but at
the same time does not allow joint ventures between foreign and South
Korean life and non-life insurance companies, the WTO report added.

MOTHER OF CHIMPANZEES ON FUND-RAISING TOUR OF TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 29 (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"It is everybody's responsibility to save
the earth," Dr. Jane Goodall, the "Mother of Chimpanzees," said on
Monday in her first speech here since her arrival on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The world-renowned British primatologist said her top concern at
the moment is the forest fires raging over large parts of Indonesia,
which is not only causing irreparable damage to the environment and
to human beings, it is also endangering the habitat of much of the
country's wildlife.
</P>
<P>
Goodall, who is here to lend support to the establishment of the
Jane Goodall Institute in Taiwan, which aims to promote global
research and conservation of wildlife, said it is hoped that part of
the funds raised in Taiwan in the near future will go to Indonesia to
help ease the difficulties there caused by the fires and the
resulting smog which has cloaked large areas of Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
This is the 63-year-old primatologist's second visit to Taiwan
since last October.
</P>
<P>
During her stay, Goodall will be joined by Vice President Lien
Chan in a fund-raising drive, soliciting funds both for the institute
and for financing global wildlife conservation efforts.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference upon her arrival on Sunday,
Goodall said she hopes that her visit here will serve as "water" to
moisturize and foster the growth of the "seed of conservation" in
Taiwan which she sowed during her first visit here last year.
</P>
<P>
Heralding her as a pioneer of wildlife conservation, Government
spokesman David Lee said the people of Taiwan should see her as a
model of human persistence for a noble humanitarian cause.
</P>
<P>
Goodall has achieved fame for her 35 years of devoted research
into chimpanzees. She has spent nearly two decades in Africa, in what
is now Tanzania's Gombe National Park, researching chimpanzees and
baboons. She began promoting global education on wildlife
conservation in 1977 when she established the Jane Goodall Institute
in the US city of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, she has made countless public appearances around
the world to promote her "Roots &amp; Shoots" campaign, a conservation
program for children.
</P>
<P>
Through the program, Goodall said, "the world's children are
taught that to care for the earth and each other is our hope for the
future."
</P>
<P>
During her stay, Goodall will meet with President Lee Teng-hui
and Premier Vincent Siew to exchange views on Taiwan's efforts in the
protection of endangered species.
</P>
<P>
She will also visit Kenting National Park at the southernmost tip
of the island, where she will see Taiwan conservationists' success in
breeding the rare Siko, or Formosan spotted deer, which has been
extinct in Taiwan's wilderness areas since 1969.
</P>
<P>
Over the last three years, specialists at Kenting have increased
the herd of Siko deer from 22 to 200, some 50 of which have been
released into the wild.
</P>
<P>
Goodall, who has been studying chimpanzees in Africa since 1957,
is considered one of the world's three leading primatologists.

intense attention to Taiwan's high-speed rail development plan, it is
also highly interested in Taiwan's telecommunications infrastructure,
said Economic Affairs Minister Wang Chih-kang on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks after meeting with his German counterpart,
Guenter Rexrodt, for an official discussion on a wide range of
topics, including the German Siemens company's joining of the
consortium which won the tender to construct Taiwan's first
high-speed rail system.
</P>
<P>
Siemens is to provide the ICE locomotives to be used in the rail
system, while France's GEC Alsthom will build the carriages,
according to a preliminary agreement.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that based on government regulations, all foreign
companies will be treated fairly and openly during bidding for any
possible projects in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Wang said he and Rexrodt also exchanged views on Germany's
support for Taiwan's joining the World Trade Organization (WTO) and
for Taiwan's observer status at the Competition Policy and Trade
Committee under the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD), further broadening cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was the second between Wang and Rexrodt since June
this year, when Wang visited Germany for the Sixth ROC-Germany
Economics Ministers meeting. Rexrodt is paying a one-day visit here.
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, Rexrodt, the highest-ranking German official to
visit Taipei in recent years, also met with Vice President Lien Chan
and Premier Vincent Siew for wide-ranging talks.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Wang noted that Austria's vice economics
minister is coming to Taipei in October for a vice-ministerial
meeting, while arrangements for bilateral economics minister-level
meetings with Belgium, France and Italy are being made.

JAPAN'S NEIGHBORS UNEASY ABOUT US-JAPAN DEFENSE TREATY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Los  Angeles,  Sept.  28  (CNA)
(By Philip Liu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Times said in an
editorial on Sunday that "the United States and Japan have revised
guidelines for their long-standing mutual security arrangement
raising Tokyo's military profile -- but only in a defensive mode. The
Japanese ban on offensive action, a legacy of post-World War II
anti-militarism, remains unchanged. But (communist) China and Japan's
other Asian neighbors are sure to be uneasy about what the new
security concept is supposed to protect; Is it Japan, the Korean
peninsula or the region?"
</P>
<P>
It said: "The revisions, disclosed last week, supersede
guidelines established in 1978 that focused on protecting Japan in
case of Soviet aggression. The new agreement carefully avoids
mentioning where in the post-Cold War world an attack might
originate. US officials insist that the security framework is not
geographical but situational. They point out that the new guidelines
establish procedures for cooperation on handling refugees,
peacekeeping duties, search-and-rescue missions, evacuation of
civilians from areas of potential conflict and other quasi-military
tasks, none of which were addressed in the 1978 accords between
Washington and Tokyo."
</P>
<P>
"But the continuing absence of any offensive military role for
Japan within the agreement has done little to ease concerns of
Japan's neighbors. China is not happy and has criticized the
agreement as a threat, particularly to its asserted sovereignty over
Taiwan. Tokyo has reassured the Chinese, declaring that it does not
support independence for Taiwan. On Washington's part, Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright says the new defense guidelines are not
`country specific.'"
</P>
<P>
"Certainly the US Tokyo guidelines will be given close scrutiny,
for the combined strength of the two countries cannot be ignored.
Chalmers Johnson, president of the Japan Policy Research Institute,
believes the guidelines will roil regional tensions, Charles Wolf Jr.
of the Rand Corp. suggests using the NATO-Russian model to establish
US-China meetings, bringing the major players under a single policy
tent. China's President Jiang Zemin's October trip to the United
States should force the Clinton administration to bring clarity and
perhaps greater substance to its Asia Policy," the daily noted.

MAC HEAD ON UNIFICATION ISSUE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Hong  Kong,  Sept. 29 (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung and Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chang King-yuh, chairman of the ROC's
cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), said that when mainland
China has developed true democracy and a prosperous economy, it will
be easier to handle the issue of a unified China.
</P>
<P>
Chang made the remarks during an interview with Ming Pao, a
prestigious Hong Kong newspaper, in San Francisco recently. The
interview was published on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chang spoke mainly of the effect of the 15th National Congress of
the Chinese Communist Party earlier this month on cross-strait
relations and the issue of unification.
</P>
<P>
Saying that since the congress was the first since the death of
mainland Chinese paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, Chang said that it
was crucial to establish the leadership under party secretary general
Jiang Zemin and the tone of its new direction.
</P>
<P>
If Jiang's leadership is established and the direction is more
open, then it will turn a new page in cross-strait relations, Chang
said.
</P>
<P>
On Jiang's remarks on cross-strait relations at the party
congress, Chang said the government has always championed the "one
China," policy. But noting that China at present is under
"separato rule," he said relations should be based on the principle
of mutual respect, goodwill and equality.
</P>
<P>
Chang said however that past experience has shown that Beijing
has persistently denied the existence of the Republic of China on
Taiwan when it espouses its "one China" policy, hindering the further
development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Beijing has used the same pretext to stifle Taiwan's
efforts to join international organizations, undermining the feelings
on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
He said Taiwan believes that after the party congress, Beijing
will not depart from its basic course, but he also expressed the hope
that Beijing leaders will cultivate new and pragmatic thinking
towards the issue.
</P>
<P>
On the proposal that Taiwan, Hong Kong, mainland China form a
commonwealth as the model for a unified China, Chang said that "it is
a good thing," that domestic scholars and experts, who are concerned
about the future of the nation, have envisaged such a plan.
</P>
<P>
But Chang said he believes the time has yet to come for such a
proposal to become reality. He said that be it a commonwealth, a
federal republic, or any other political system for the future, the
most important thing is that each body within the system will be
treated with equal respect.
</P>
<P>
Chang said that the unification of Taiwan, Hong Kong, mainland
China and Macau will hinge on the democratic process in the mainland,
adding: "We can hardly imagine that an authoritarian regime today
could sign a democratic constitution tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
"It (mainland China) has no experience of democracy and has never
had the experience of tolerating different opinions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chang stressed that only further economic reforms, a more open
society and more political changes will trigger a
democratic development in the mainland.

AUSTRALIA TO ABOLISH IMPORT CONTROLS ON COMPACT DISCS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Canberra,  Sept.  29  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Australia plans for the first time to
abolish import controls on compact discs while at the same time
considering tough new anti-piracy rules to guard against a flood of
counterfeit CDs from overseas.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Department of Communications said CD prices will
fall by between A$1.60 and A$3.00 immediately after the import ban is
lifted in the next few months and further cuts may follow down the
track.
</P>
<P>
CD prices in Australia are one of the world's most expensive
because of government controls on imported CDs. After the lifting of
the import ban, Australian consumers will still pay about A$7.00 more
than their American counterparts after adjustments for sales tax and
royalties, industry sources estimated.
</P>
<P>
The Australian record industry will be given six months to
prepare for the competition.
</P>
<P>
The government will introduce tougher laws designed to punish
offenders for selling or producing counterfeit CDs, with jail
sentences of up to five years, in addition to fines.
</P>
<P>
The government plan to lift the import ban controls comes after
reports that CD sales slumped 7.5 percent in the first six months of
this year compared with the same period of 1996 and that consumers
are getting around the high prices by ordering CDs on the Internet.

JIANG ZEMIN SEEN IN DILEMMA AFTER PARTY CONGRESS VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Canberra,  Sept.  29  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite his victory at the 15th
Communist Party Congress earlier this month, mainland China's
President Jiang Zemin is facing a fundamentally insoluble dilemma in
running the world's biggest communist country, according to a leading
China specialist in Australia.
</P>
<P>
Writing for the mass circulation newspaper The Australian on
Monday, Robert Elegant, an author well-versed in Asian and China
affairs, said Jiang has won "a temporary victory" from the party
congress by securing the support of the Armed Forces and successfully
purging his enemies from the party's key organs and putting his
friends in their place.
</P>
<P>
Elegant said in his article entitled "Jiang's Triumph Is
Temporary," that Jiang's dilemma is fundamentally insoluble. "He must
cede power to the provinces and the cities, as well as to private
businessmen and industrialists, if he is to retain power by meeting
the people's needs."
</P>
<P>
"The more economic freedom he allows, the more pressing and
strident will be demands for greater political and cultural freedom,"
Elegant said.
</P>
<P>
"Granting those demands would in the long run bring down the
dictatorial Communist Party, which has just reavowed its need and
determination to rule by repression," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said mainland China's economic liberalization not only
inspires demands for political liberalization but automatically
decreases the power of the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
He said economic liberalization has caused havoc for the
Communist Party and its leaders in the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
"The initial relaxation of dogmatism two decades ago resulted in
far greater production. It also produced unintended consequences.
First was the Democracy Wall in Beijing in 1979, when giant posters
denounced communist authoritarianism and ineptitude -- until all
posters were banned and their authors jailed," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"In 1989, the climactic result of Deng's economic relaxation was
the pro-democracy movement that demanded an end to communist
corruption and inflation -- and a greater popular voice in the
process of government. The leadership of that nationwide protest was
crushed by guns and tanks in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, giving the
People's Republic a fearsome notoriety throughout the world," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the party congress, Jiang ordered further severe
restrictions on religion, expression, assembly and the media.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's reform of China's state-owned enterprises by privatizing
them will result in enormous unemployment, Elegant noted.
</P>
<P>
"With a floating population of some 150 million unemployed, most
from rural areas, China cannot afford to throw an additional 100
million out of work when, say, 150,000 loss-making enterprises go
bankrupt," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Yet the alternative is a breakdown of the banking and financial
system that could inflict even more grievous wounds, destabilizing
the social order and threatening the hold of the Communist Party," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Tension is already high. Swathes of prosperity along the coast
are sadly offset by large areas of poverty inland. The farmers, who
still make up some 65 percent of the population, are extremely
discontented and resentful of the cities' well-being," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that armed clashes are already occurring between the
police, even the army, and the disgruntled in both town and country,
as well as with disaffected minorities.
</P>
<P>
"Despite soaring economic growth in coastal provinces, which is
based largely on China's literally inexhaustible pool of cheap labor,
the prospects for Beijing are not bright," he said. "Jiang has won a
signal victory. But it is somewhat like beating out the competition
to become captain of the Titanic," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said: "It is a terrible thing to be an intelligent communist
leader nowadays, few as there are. The more intelligent you are, the
more enlightened your policies, the faster you tread the slippery
road towards self-destruction," Elegant commented.

TURKEY TIGHTENS OPERATION IN NORTHERN IRAQ

<TEXT>
<P>
Despite strong reactions from the
capitals of Turkey's neighboring states, Turkish troops on Sunday
were continuing their cross-border operations against separatist
Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) camps in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
After a week of air raids and operations by about 15,000 Turkish
troops and over 100 tanks backed by F-16 and F-4 fighter jets, many
PKK camps have been destroyed and nearly 50 guerrillas killed,
according to military officials.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to Anatolia news agency reports, the Iranian
Foreign Ministry issued a statement deploring the operation, saying
Ankara's incursions were fueling regional instability and calling for
their "immediate withdrawal from Iraq."
</P>
<P>
The official Syrian news agency was also quoted as saying that
the operation was a "flagrant violation of Iraq's integrity and an
overt violation of the United Nations Charter," while the Arab
Parliamentarians' Union also condemned Turkey's incursion and urged
Turkey to immediately withdraw its troops.

HOWARD'S REELECTION BID IN DOUBT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Canberra,  Sept.  29  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The bid for reelection for Australian
Prime Minister John Howard in 1998 is now in doubt after his firing
of three ministers and two of his most-trusted staff over fraudulent
travel allowances and a subsequent cover-up last week, political
analysts said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Howard forced Transport Minister John Sharp, Administrative
Services Minister David Jull and Science and Technology Minister
Peter McGauran to resign after finding they had made false travel
expense claims and had later tried to repay them secretly into the
government coffers.
</P>
<P>
Howard was also forced to sack Grahame Morris, his chief of
political staff, his closest adviser and personal friend of more than
20 years, and his trusted staff manager Fiona McKenna, in connection
with the cover-up over the claims.
</P>
<P>
The cover-up was leaked to the opposition, which took the
opportunity to attack Howard's "Honest John" government.
</P>
<P>
"There has never been bloodletting like this... It is
Shakespearean more in its farce than its tragedy," writes Paul Kelly,
a senior political writer for the mass-circulation newspaper The
Australian.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Leader Kim Beazley said: "We've got a government now
which cannot run an economy, cannot run itself, cannot defend
Australia's honor internationally."
</P>
<P>
Since Howard, dubbed "Honest John," defeated former Prime
Minister Paul Keating in March 1996, he has been beset with a series
of both internal and external problems.
</P>
<P>
The domestic problems include the buyback of guns and weapons
after a massacre of 35 people by a lone gunman in Port Arthur,
Tasmania, in 1996, a lingering high unemployment rate, tax reforms
and native land titles.
</P>
<P>
All these problems remain unresolved despite unceasing efforts by
the Howard government.
</P>
<P>
Externally, bilateral ties with mainland China have been strained
since 1996, when Canberra allowed a visit by the Dalai Lama to Sydney
and other cities, sent a senior minister to Taipei, renewed a defense
security pact between Australia and the United States and supported
the US sending aircraft carriers to the Taiwan Strait during mainland
China's missile tests there in the same year.
</P>
<P>
Most of these problems have been resolved.
</P>
<P>
But the latest scandal, known as "travelgate," is adding fuel to
the fire of domestic problems and analysts believe the chances of
Howard being reelected for the second term next year is "in serious
doubt."

SEARCH CONTINUES FOR CLUES TO GARUDA CRASH
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Jakarta,  Sept. 28 (CNA)
(By Wu Pin-chiang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Investigators sifted through the charred
wreckage of the Garuda Airbus A-300 that went down near Medan, North
Sumatra, on Friday to find clues that would help them determine the
cause of Indonesia's worst air disaster.
</P>
<P>
The recovery efforts centered on a search for the aircraft's
flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder, as well as for more
victims of the crash that killed all 234 passengers and crew.
</P>
<P>
Airline officials said at least 18 foreigners were among the
dead, including American, Dutch, French, German, Japanese, Taiwan and
Belgian nationals, the Indonesian Observer reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers said some of the victims were found hundreds of meters
from the crash site, hanging from trees or buried in mud in a
500-meter-deep ravine. Most were unrecognizable, according to some
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Rescue leader Lt. Col. Benjamin S. Dandel said search efforts
have been hampered by the poor weather conditions, which also
prevented a team from Airbus Industries, as well as relatives of the
victims, from reaching Medan to help in the investigation and in
identification of the bodies.
</P>
<P>
The plane went down 32 km west of Medan's Polonia Airport, 1,400
km northwest of Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Air Transportation Director General Zainuddin Sikado said that
the government has set up a task force to probe the crash and that
the team will announce their findings in three month's time.
</P>
<P>
He also said Garuda Indonesia will continue to operate its fleet
of Airbus aircraft, saying that there is no reason not to.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the Garuda office in Jakarta said the 23-year-old
plane was equipped with the Omega Navigation System, which is now
obsolete, having been replaced by the more advanced Global
Positioning System.

EXPERTS SEE CROSS-STRAIT DIALOGUE UNLIKELY THIS SPRING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 29 (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing may have intended to ease tension
across the Taiwan Strait, but a resumption of dialogue with Taipei in
spring next year as speculators have alleged, is unlikely, a number
of experts agreed during a roundtable discussion on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Liao Kuang-sheng, a consultant to the National Security Council,
said while busying themselves with pushing mainland China into the
international economic arena, Beijing authorities will at best make
some "technical adjustments" to ease cross-strait tension.
</P>
<P>
However, a "breakthrough" in ties with Taiwan are unlikely, at
least in the near future, he noted, citing as an example Beijing's
silence in the face of Premier Vincent Siew's several calls for
mainland China to resume talks since he took office on Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
Liao pinpointed Beijing's unwillingness to accept the fact that
Taiwan is an existing political entity as the crux of the
cross-strait political impasse.
</P>
<P>
He said there are no traces that Beijing has softened its stance
on Taiwan, citing Beijing's refusal to allow Taiwan officials to
attend the World Bank annual meeting held in Hong Kong last week.
</P>
<P>
The time is not right for a resumption of cross-strait dialogue
at present, Lian noted. The two sides had better start with talks on
technical affairs, such as seeking legal statutes protecting Taiwan
investors on the mainland, private exchanges between Taiwan and Hong
Kong, as well economic, trade and cultural exchanges between Taiwan
and mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Lee Ching-ping, deputy secretary general of the semi-official
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), noted that although there have
been rumors that cross-strait dialogue may resume in the spring of
next year, Taipei will not accept any preconditions set up by Beijing
for returning to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Chou Hsu from National Chengchi University, meanwhile, said
he does not see either side of the Taiwan Strait willing at present
to return to the negotiating table. He predicted that Beijing will
not make the first move until achieving success in Hong Kong with its
"one China, two systems" efforts, while Taiwan needs time to reach
consensus in its inner circle before making any further moves.
</P>
<P>
Chou pointed out that Taiwan's year-end mayoral and magistrate
elections, as well as the United States' positions on Beijing and
Taiwan will all be factors influencing cross-strait ties.
</P>
<P>
"It takes two to tango," he stressed, saying that to create
harmonious relations across the Taiwan Strait, Beijing should refrain
from containment schemes against Taiwan in the international
community, while Taiwan should review its "no haste, be patient"
policy on Taiwan's trade and investment activities in mainland China.

PREMIER ASSIGNS STATE MINISTERS TO MONITOR MAJOR PROJECTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept. 29 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Vincent Siew held a conference of
state ministers Monday, the first since his Cabinet was sworn in on
Sept. 1, and assigned seven ministers without portfolio to monitor
various government policies as well as to supervise the 12 major
projects undertaken by the government.
</P>
<P>
Conferences of this sort, inaugurated by Siew's predecessor Lien
Chan, differ from weekly Cabinet meetings in that they don't bring
together all members of the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Siew was briefed on the refurbishing of aging
housing complexes for the dependents of military personnel, risks of
development on or near hillsides, public security, streamlining of
financial audits and controls, improvement of social order,
government reform and inappropriate military training procedures. He
instructed seven state ministers to monitor these areas, according to
David Lee, director-general of the Government Information Office.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that the premier, who promised in his inaugural address
that his Cabinet would get off to a running start, asked the
ministers of state to work as a team and make tangible achievements
before the end of the year. He ordered the Council for Economic
Planning and Development to keep a close eye on the progress of the
government's projects and ensure they are completed on time.
</P>
<P>
Lee said Siew asked Vice Premier John Chang to monitor the
development of the Kaohsiung multi-function economic and trade zone
and preside over the educational reform panel to study the demands
made at a huge demonstration Sunday against the National Assembly's
decision in July to annul a constitutional safeguard for the
educational budget.

Siew touted the government's high-speed railroad plan, which a

Renato Ruggiero, Director-General of the
Geneva-based World Trade Organization (WTO), told the International
Industry Conference in San Francisco Monday that mainland China's
modernization alone will require imports of equipment and technology
of about US$100 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
"For China, WTO accession is a key element in the domestic reform
process -- providing security of access to world markets, binding
dispute settlement and a seat at the table as we continue writing the
trade rules of the 21st century," Ruggiero said.

"We are entering a new world and a new kind of economy -- with
great benefits as well as risks," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
German Economic Minister Guenter Rexrodt
promised on Monday during his one-day stopover here to help Taiwan
enter the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with his Taiwan counterpart, Wang Chih-kang,
Rexrodt told a news conference that his country's experience in
infrastructure projects would ensure the island's high-speed railroad
is built to specifications.
</P>
<P>
A consortium that includes Siemens, a German company, has just
won the right to negotiate with the government on building the
island's first high-speed railroad. If the negotiations conclude
successfully, the line will use engines manufactured by Siemens.
</P>
<P>
Wang said at the press conference that he and Rexrodt reached a
consensus on seven issues, including a stepping up of cooperation
between the small and medium-sized companies of Taiwan and Germany to
develop each other's markets, Germany agreeing to purchase locally
made equipment whenever possible in building the high-speed railroad
here, and the early signing of accords on investment protection and
the avoidance of double taxation.
</P>
<P>
Wang said he also sought Rexrodt's support for the island's bid
for observer status at a committee under the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development.
</P>
<P>
This is the second meeting this year between the two ministers,
despite the absence of diplomatic ties between Taipei and Bonn. Wang
called on Rexrodt in Germany in June at the 6th ROC-German meeting of
economics ministers.
</P>
<P>
After the press conference, Rexrodt also met with Minister of
Finance Paul Chiu and Minister of Transportation and Communications
Tsay Jaw-yang. He left the island for home at 7:50 p.m..

NEW M'LAND RAILWAY TO BRING JOBS, CLEANER AIR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Manila Sept. 29 (CNA)
(By Timothy Sun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a
US$200 million loan on Monday for a railway project in a poor and
little-developed province of mainland China.
</P>
<P>
The planned 368-km railway line from North Shenmu to North Yanan
will open up abundant resources of low sulfur coal in mineral-rich
but landlocked Shaanxi Province. This will bring major environmental
benefits as coal meets 70 percent of mainland China's energy demand
and high sulfur coal is a leading cause of air pollution.
</P>
<P>
The project is also expected to create 370,000 new jobs by 2005
and drastically reduce poverty from 22 percent to 5 percent in a
region where the lack of transport links has been a major constraint
on development.
</P>
<P>
The ADB will also provide a technical assistance grant of
US$400,000 from the Japan Special Fund to help the local railway
companies in Shaanxi develop financially viable commercial
operations.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to cost a total of US$795.5 million and
be completed in December 2002.

TWO MORE COUNTRIES SPEAK FOR ROC'S UN BID
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
New  York,  Sept.  29 (CNA)
(By K.C. Huang and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two more countries voiced support for
the Republic of China's bid to rejoin the United Nations at the UN
General Assembly debate on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Saint Christopher and Nevis Prime Minister Denzil Douglas and
Burkina Faso Minister of Foreign Affairs Ablasse Ouedraogo used their
speeches to the General Assembly debate session to deliver strong
appeals for the ROC's UN bid.
</P>
<P>
Douglas said in his address that the outstanding achievements the
people of Taiwan have made over the past few decades should not be
ignored.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Douglas said he is convinced that if Taiwan is given
equal opportunities to take part in international organizations and
activities, the international community will benefit from Taiwan's
progress in economic, scientific, technological and social
developments.
</P>
<P>
The Saint Christopher prime minister also advised the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait to make concerted efforts to break their current
deadlock and resume constructive dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"Our observation is that a solution to cross-strait issues
requires continued dialogue and the good will of both sides," Douglas
added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Ouedraogo explicitly urged the UN
General Assembly to re-examine its 1971 Resolution No. 2758, which
expelled the ROC from the world body to make way for Communist China.
</P>
<P>
Ouedraogo said Burkina Faso has no intention of challenging or
provoking any other UN member. "We only hope the United Nations will
recognize the existence of the Republic of China based on changes in
the general international situation," he noted, citing the ROC's
formal and informal relations with many other countries as evidence
of its existence.
</P>
<P>
Ouedraogo further said his country's support for the ROC's UN bid
is mainly aimed at bringing justice to the 21.5 million people of
Taiwan who he said have consistently endeavored to promote China's
reunification under freedom and democracy.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the two countries, seven other UN members --
Nicaragua, Fiji, Paraguay, El Salvador, Honduras, the Dominican
Republic and Swaziland -- have also voiced support for the ROC's UN
bid since the current General Assembly debate session started on
Sept. 22.
</P>
<P>
A noteworthy development was that Panamanian Minister of Foreign
Affairs Ricardo Alberto Arias didn't appeal for the ROC's UN
representation in his address to the General Assembly debate on Sept.
26.
</P>
<P>
In previous years, the Panamanian minister consistently used his
speech to the General Assembly debate to deliver his country's
support for the ROC's UN bid.
</P>
<P>
Panama recognizes the Republic of China whose president, Lee
Teng-hui, made a state visit to the Central American country in early
September.

AGE SAID TO BE FACTOR IN NOMINATIONS FOR TOP CPC POSITIONS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The impact of the elections of members of
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) at the
Party's recently concluded 15th National Congress is still being
felt, according to informed sources.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports have said that a desire to rejuvenate the
Party with younger members was one of the factors governing the
selection of candidates for the Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
For example, except for CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin, all
members of the CPC Political Bureau are below the age of 70. Thus,
elderly members of the 14th Central Committee Political Bureau such
as Qiao Shi, Liu Huaqing, Zao Jiahua, Yang Baibing and Wang Hanbin
are gone from the current committee's line-up.
</P>
<P>
Hua Guofeng, 76, is the oldest member of the 15th Central
Committee. He was able to retain his membership despite the new
unwritten law against elderly members owing to the fact that he had
been CPC chairman and helped bring about the downfall of the "Gang of
Four." But the other septuagenarians did not fare as well.
</P>
<P>
Another factor governing the nomination of candidates to Central
Committee positions was "revolutionization," or sincere devotion to
the Party's ideology and job performance, the sources said.

TAIWAN VISITORS TO HONG KONG POSTED DROP IN JULY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Hong  Kong, Sept. 30 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan people paid some 147,000 visits
to Hong Kong in July, a decline of 14.2 percent from the same month
last year, according to statistics made public by the Hong Kong
Tourist Association.
</P>
<P>
Between January and July, however, the number of tourist visits
to the former British colony by Taiwan people rose to 1.14 million,
up 15.1 percent from the same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent of Taiwan tourists flew into Hong Kong, while 28
percent entered by train from mainland China. The remainder reached
Hong Kong by ferry.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan tourists spent an average of 2.45 days in Hong Kong on
each visit, less time than visitors from other places. Mainland
tourists had the longest average stay at 5.12 days, while people from
other countries remained an average of 3.61 days.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong people made some 220,000 visits to Taiwan during the
same seven-month period, representing an increase of 12.2 percent
from the year-earlier level. This number, however, only accounted for
1 percent of total out-bound travels from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In light of the drop in the number of Taiwan visitors to Hong
Kong in July, travel agents, airline companies and trade associations
from Taiwan and Hong Kong gathered on Monday to discuss methods of
reviving Taiwan people's interest in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The attendees agreed that the difficult and time-consuming
procedure of obtaining a Hong Kong visa is the main reason behind the
drop. They will once again demand that Hong Kong authorities simplify
the procedure for Taiwan people to enter Hong Kong.

MING DYNASTY HEADS GET NOD TO RETURN TO M'LAND CHINA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  30  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the first case of its kind, the
government has agreed to allow a Taiwan entrepreneur to return the
heads of 18 Buddhist statues to mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yung-tai, chairman of the Aurora Group in Taiwan and a
connoisseur of antiquities, bought the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644)
artifacts fron Japan and Taiwan last year.
</P>
<P>
Chen later learned that they belong to Zishou Temple in Shuxi
Village, Shanxi Province. Four years ago, the heads of the statues of
arhat (Buddhist monks who attained Nirvana) were sawn off from their
torsos and smuggled out of mainland China.
</P>
<P>
In April, Chen, who has investments in Shanghai, contacted Zhang
Zhiqun, director of the Shanghai municipal government's Taiwan
Affairs Office, expressing his desire to return the art treasures to
their rightful place.
</P>
<P>
The Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS),
Beijing's intermediary body set up to deal with cross-strait
exchanges in the absence of official ties, then contacted its Taipei
counterpart, the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), asking it to help
Chen to return the items as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The request put the SEF and the Mainland Affairs Council -- which
is in charge of charting the government policies of the government
toward the Chinese mainland -- in a dilemma, as regulations clearly
state that major cultural relics cannot be turned over to non-ROC
nationals or sent overseas.
</P>
<P>
But after carefully studying the issue and weighing the
importance of combating smuggling, preserving Chinese culture and
upholding the spirit of international conventions, the government
decided to approve the transfer.
</P>
<P>
Chen's case has provided an opportunity for both sides of the
Taiwan Strait to think about the question, sources said. The ROC
government helping the return of smuggled art treasures to mainland
China would be seen as a goodwill gesture and hopefully become a
catalyst for improved cross-strait relations, they said.
</P>
<P>
The government will also urge Beijing to address the problem of
smuggled art treasures squarely and work together with Taipei to
solve the problem, the sources said.

GERMAN PARLIAMENTARIAN SAYS BEIJING SHOULD RENOUNCE USE OF FORCE

<DATELINE>
Bonn,  Sept.  30  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Burkhard Hirsch, deputy speaker of the
German Parliament, said Monday that the West should made it clear to
mainland China that any attempt to solve the Taiwan issue with force
would be unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Hirsch made his point in a speech delivered at a reception
marking the 40th anniversary of the founding of the German-Chinese
Society in Bonn. He emphasized that as a member of the United Nations
Security Council, mainland China is obliged to adhere to the
principle of not using force.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Germans experienced years of separation but
reunited without force.
</P>
<P>
While some politicians believe the "one country, two systems"
formula Beijing applies in Hong Kong could also be applied to Taiwan,
Hirsch disagreed, pointing out that Hong Kong, unlike the Republic of
China on Taiwan, was a ceded territory of the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
He did, however, maintain that both sides of the Taiwan Strait
are parts of a separated China.
</P>
<P>
He said that Taiwan and Germany are important to each other. The
German-Chinese Society has contributed to the promotion of political,
economic and cultural contacts between Germany and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The German-Chinese Society was founded in February 1957. The
society's president, former German parliamentarian Ortwin Lowack,
said at the reception Monday that the organization serves as an
important channel of communication between Germans and the people on
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
ROC Representative to Germany Charles King said that the
German-Chinese Society has persistently provided advice to and
support for the Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang Behrendt, vice chairman of the Bonn-Taipei
Parliamentarian Group, was also invited to speak on the occasion. He
lauded the achievements of the German-Chinese Society in promoting
mutual understanding. He pointed out the efforts of the society
contributed to the realization of direct flights between Germany and
Taiwan, simplification of visa applications, regular meetings between
the economic ministers of the two countries and elevation of the
status of the ROC's representation in Germany.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 members and guests attended the celebrations, which
featured also Chinese and German music and poems by Yu Kuang-chung.

The big fear in Vancouver these days is
they're going back -- those Hong Kong big-money investors who have
been immigrating to British Columbia (B.C.), Canada, and who, with
their wads of cash and trans-Pacific connections, were supposed to
turn this laid-back city into some kind of frantic New York West.
</P>
<P>
The Toronto Star reported Monday that every few days, there is
another story in the Vancouver press testifying to this worrying
phenomenon. Only 23 homes sold for more than C$1 million (US$725,000)
in Greater Vancouver this year, one newspaper reported ominously.
Another report noted that the average price for a home on the city's
west side, the area favored by wealthy Chinese immigrants, has fallen
by C$250,000 (US$181,000), or 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese are going back to Hong Kong," one real estate agent
was quoted as explaining. And the province is spooked -- to such an
extent that Premier Glen Clark's New Democratic Party (NDP)
government is quietly asking Ottawa to back off from plans to make
tax evasion by the rich more difficult, according to the
Vancouver-datelined story.
</P>
<P>
It was referring to a law requiring wealthy Canadian residents to
disclose all worldwide assets worth more than C$100,000. In British
Columbia, the law is a "cause celebre": From the Vancouver Board of
Trade to the NDP, the asset disclosure law is blamed for the exodus
of rich Hong Kong immigrants.
</P>
<P>
"If you don't want the rich, you'll get more refugees and
family-class immigrants," developer David Choi, son of Hong Kong
multimillionaire C.K. Choi, warned in the Vancouver Sun newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese are very private about their money," Jenny Kwan, a
31-year-old NDP member of the B.C. legislature, told The Star. "This
(disclosure) law goes against our culture."
</P>
<P>
"I don't support tax evasion and never will," Clark said in an
interview. "But the question is: Is this the only way to deal with
the problem? Let's make sure this cure for tax evasion is the right
one and doesn't discourage the kind of investment we want."
</P>
<P>
The reason for the premier's concern is that immigration has been
big business for British Columbia. Since the groundbreaking agreement
between Britain and mainland China in 1984 to return Hong Kong to
Beijing's rule at midnight June 30, 1997, Canada has been working
hard to woo the territory's wealthiest inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
In 1986, two new categories of landed immigrant were invented to
attract the moneyed. A so-called entrepreneurial immigrant could win
a place in Canada by promising to create at least one job. And a rich
person with C$350,000 to invest (or in some cases C$250,000) could
qualify as an investor immigrant.
</P>
<P>
After three years, if these business immigrants met all the other
criteria, they were granted citizenship.
</P>
<P>
The programs have attracted well-to-do immigrants from Hong Kong,
Taiwan and, more recently, mainland China. While many went to the
Toronto area, the largest concentration of business immigrants
settled in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
David Ley, director of the University of British Columbia's
Center of Excellence for the Study of Immigration and Integration,
estimates that since 1990, about 50,000 business immigrants from Hong
Kong have settled in Greater Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
They, and the money they brought with them, buffered B.C. from
the recession of the '90s. Vancouver in particular prospered, as the
newcomers -- seemingly impervious to high housing prices -- bid up
the city's already overheated housing market.
</P>
<P>
There was some grumbling as the city absorbed thousands of new
Asian immigrants, but in the main, British Columbians welcomed the
money. They didn't want it to stop, the Star said.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the vast majority of people from Hong Kong who came to
Canada were not rich. As Kwan points out, most were like her parents:
they settled, found work and set about making a life in a new place.
</P>
<P>
Immigration from Hong Kong peaked in 1994 as those planning to
leave hurried to get out before the handover to mainland China. That
year, 10,296 business immigrants and their families settled in
British Columbia. By last year, that number had dropped to 7,058.
</P>
<P>
But many of these wealthier investor immigrants had options not
open to their compatriots. As Gabriel Yiu, a 35-year-old broadcaster
and small-business owner notes, for some immigrants a Canadian
passport was simply a form of insurance.
</P>
<P>
"In the Chinese community, we understand the problems," said Yiu,
who immigrated from Hong Kong six years ago. "We have no harsh
feeling toward those who leave. But we also hear of cases where the
husband makes plenty of money in Hong Kong and pays no Canadian
taxes, yet his family lives here."

<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's Central Election Commission (CEC)
on Monday officially announced that the year-end city and county
elections will be held Nov. 29.
</P>
<P>
The elections will determine the heads of 23 local governments,
including those of all 16 counties on Taiwan, five municipal regions
and Fukien Province's two counties -- the outlying islands of Kinmen
and Matsu.
</P>
<P>
CEC officials also announced candidates must register Oct. 26-30
and that the official campaign period will be Nov. 19-28.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's three major political parties -- the ruling Kuomintang,
the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the New Party -- are all
eyeing the races with a great deal of interest.
</P>
<P>
KMT sources said the party is cautiously optimistic of victory.
High ranking KMT officials assured voters that all the party's
candidates will be capable and morally impeccable, adding that they
should have no problem winning the support of voters in their areas.
</P>
<P>
The DPP, the largest opposition party, has announced a plan to
begin campaigning for its candidates around the island on Oct. 2.
</P>
<P>
The DPP will make use of rock bands and several well-known
politicians at its rallies to boost support for its candidates.
</P>
<P>
According to observers, the opposition New Party is not expected
to do well in the local elections. A leading New Party figure,
however, said the party plans to run candidates in Taipei County,
Miaoli County, Taichung City, Nantou County, Kinmen County and
Lienchiang County (Matsu), and is looking to win all of those races.

RESUMPTION OF ROC-KOREA AIR LINKS DEPENDS ON SEOUL'S ATTITUDE: SIEW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 30 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Vincent Siew said Tuesday that the
resumption of air links between Taiwan and South Korea lies in South
Korean authorities showing goodwill and sincerity.
</P>
<P>
"The aviation accord talks between the Republic of China and
South Korea have lasted for years," Siew said in response to
interpellation from legislator Chuang Chin-sheng of the ruling
Kuomintang that the lack of direct air links between Taiwan and South
Korea following the severing of diplomatic ties in August 1992 has
greatly inconvenienced people in both countries.
</P>
<P>
"Technically, there wouldn't be much difficulty in resuming the
air links," Siew noted. "But regretfully, whenever it comes to the
substantive part of the negotiations, South Korea has failed to show
goodwill and respect for the ROC's sovereignty," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked how the two sides could eliminate the obstacles and reach
an aviation accord, Siew declared, "South Korea has to change its
position."
</P>
<P>
The premier said that although Taiwan handles its aviation
relations with other countries practically, it is totally
unacceptable for the countries concerned to show little respect for
the ROC's sovereignty.

PRESIDENT LEE MEETS MOTHER OF CHIMPANZEES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Lee Teng-hui met with Dr. Jane
Goodall, commonly known as the "Mother of Chimpanzees," on Tuesday
for talks on wildlife conservation and research.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, President Lee promised to donate NT$1 million
(US$34,965) under his own name to the Jane Goodall Institute to help
finance its program to set up a branch in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lee also expressed his hope that local residents will support the
current fund-raising drive to facilitate the establishment of the
Jane Goodall Institute in Taiwan, which will be dedicated to
enhancing the younger generation's care and respect for the
environment, wildlife and human beings.
</P>
<P>
This was the second tete-a-tete between Lee and the
world-renowned British primatologist. Goodall asked Lee to autograph
a black chimpanzee puppet that he presented to her during her first
visit to Taiwan last October.
</P>
<P>
During their half-hour talk, Lee decided to take time out of his
busy schedule and accompany Goodall on a trip to the Kenting National
Park at the southernmost tip of Taiwan to see Taiwan
conservationists' success in breeding the rare Siko, also known as
the Formosan spotted deer, which had been extinct in Taiwan's
wilderness areas since 1969. Over the past three years, specialists
at Kenting have managed to increase the herd of Siko deer from 22 to
200, some 50 of which have been released into the wild.
</P>
<P>
According to the itinerary arranged by the Government Information
Office, Vice President Lien Chan was to accompany Goodall on her
Kenting tour. As Lee once promised to accompany Goodall to travel on
the island to see for herself Taiwan's efforts to conserve and
protect endangered species, the president insisted on honoring his
promise even if he would have to change his working schedule.
</P>
<P>
Goodall said she was moved by the president's insistence on
honoring his promise, calling Lee a "rare species" in the world
political community.
</P>
<P>
Noting that honoring a promise is a traditional Chinese virtue,
Lee said he would take great pleasure in accompanying Goodall to
inspect Taiwan's conservation efforts.
</P>
<P>
"I also hope your visit will help upgrade local residents'
awareness of the importance of environmental protection, wildlife
conservation and humanitarianism," Lee told Goodall.
</P>
<P>
Goodall arrived in Taipei on Sunday for a six-day visit. While
here, the 63-year-old primatologist will attend a bazaar aimed at
raising funds for the planned Taiwan branch of the Jane Goodall
Institute.
</P>
<P>
Goodall, who has been studying chimpanzees in Africa since 1957,
is considered one of the world's three leading primatologists. In
recent years, she has traveled around the world to promote her "Roots
and Shoots" campaign, a conservation program for children.

BEIJING HOPES CONFINE TAIWAN BY STRENGTHENING TIES WITH WASHINGTON
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Beijing,  Sept.  30  (CNA)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland China is trying to build a
framework to confine Taiwan, whether or not Beijing succeeds in its
years of effort to set up a strategic partnership with Washington.
</P>
<P>
In face of things, even though Taipei is in no position to steer
either Beijing or Washington, it still can express its opinion: that
the United States should not strengthen its ties with mainland China
at Taiwan's expense.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has been stressing points of mutual interest with
Washington on the one hand, and never hesitating to remind Washington
that the "Taiwan problem" is the key hindrance to the development of
their bilateral relationship on the other.
</P>
<P>
Beijing hopes Washington will accept its framework on Taipei in
order to maintain US interests related to mainland China.
</P>
<P>
That framework is the three joint communiques between Washington
and Beijing. So far as Beijing is concerned, the communiques
represent Washington's agreement that there is only one China and
that the United States would gradually and continuously reduce arms
sales to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
However, in acknowledging in the communiques that Taiwan is part
of China, the United States did not state that the island is part of
the "People's Republic of China." And Washington has premised the
reduction of arms sales to Taipei on peace across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Because of this, Beijing has been trying to use matters of
interest to the United States to entice Washington into accepting
Beijing's interpretation of the three joint communiques as a way of
further confining Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Beijing and Washington's consultations on their strategic
partnership are therefore going on at a crucial time.
</P>
<P>
Taipei should make it clear that Taiwan and the United States
also have common interests, and that no matter what relations Beijing
and Washington establish, these should not be at the expense of
Taiwan or dependent upon Washington accepting Beijing's unilateral
interpretation of the three joint communiques.

Two jet fighters crashed Tuesday in a
mountainous area of the eastern county of Hualien, killing three
pilots, air force headquarters said.
</P>
<P>
An air force spokesman said the accident occurred at about 11:33
a.m. when one F-5E and a twin-seater F-5F were flying across the
mountains near the Hualien coastline on their way back to their air
base following a routine training mission.
</P>
<P>
Military rescue workers reached the scene of the accident later
that afternoon, where they found wreckage from the fighters and the
bodies of the three pilots scattered across a hillside.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the crash was not immediately known, the spokesman
said, adding that whether the two military fighter planes had
collided with one another, or whether they had smashed into the
mountain was as yet undetermined.
</P>
<P>
Local residents said they heard three huge explosions at around
11:30 a.m..
</P>

COA STATES STANCE AMID CIRCUS ROW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  30 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Council of Agriculture (COA) said on
Tuesday that current regulations do not ban circuses from performing
here but that any animals imported have to meet strict quarantine
requirements.
</P>
<P>
COA Vice Chairman Ling Hsiang-nung made the remarks after hearing
an argument between the Life Conservationist Association (LCA), an
animal rights group, and International New Aspect Cultural &amp;
Educational Foundation, which has invited a circus to perform here.
</P>
<P>
Ling said the COA has not yet received the foundation's
application for the American Universal Circus.
</P>
<P>
LCA President Sakya Chao-Fei, accompanied by New Party Legislator
Fu Kun-cheng, appealed to the COA to turn down the application for
the circus to perform here from late October till early November.
</P>
<P>
Sakya Chao-Fei also said that as Taiwan has been declared a
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) infected region, if the circus animals
are from a non-FMD region, returning them to their countries will be
a problem.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, she said that when New Aspect invited The Great
European Circus to perform here last year, there were reports of its
bears not leaving on time and that circus trainers had approached the
association with accusations that New Aspect was abusing the animals
by allowing them to be housed in stiflingly hot quarters with
corrugated iron roofs.
</P>
<P>
Hsu Po-yun, the executive director of New Aspect, explained that
the late departure of the animals was due to delays on the part of
the shipping company. In addition, he said that only one of the
performing animals is susceptible to FMD and that the foundation has
sought the advice of animal conservationists and legal experts
regarding the importing of circus animals.
</P>
<P>
Ling said that current laws target the conservation of wild
animals, but have not banned the circus from importing performing
animals here, citing that such animals are strictly regulated under
laws governing the import and export of animals for purposes of
education and research, as well as circus performances.
</P>
<P>
New Aspect said that the circus includes tigers, sea lions,
elephants, bears and horses, which the COA said are not cloven-hoofed
animals susceptible to FMD.

BEIJING URGED TO SHELVE SOVEREIGNTY ISSUE FOR RESUMPTION OF TALKS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  Sept.  30  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Vincent Siew on Tuesday urged
mainland China to shelve the controversial "sovereignty issue" in
order to facilitate the resumption of dialogue across the Taiwan
Strait.
</P>
<P>
Siew's statement came after mainland Chinese Vice Premier and
Minister of Foreign Affairs Qian Qichen said a day earlier that he
hopes Taiwan will consult with Beijing on procedural arrangements for
bilateral political talks.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that the mainland leadership has made such
a public call for cross-strait consultations on procedural issues in
preparation for the opening of political talks.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions at a Legislative Yuan plenary session, Siew
said he is glad to hear the mainland calls for cross-strait
consultations, stressing that it was mainland China which
unilaterally suspended cross-strait dialogue and adding that Taiwan
has never closed the door on talks.
</P>
<P>
If mainland China is sincere in its wish to resume negotiations,
Siew said, it should not impose any premises or prerequisites and
should shelve its claim that the communist regime in Beijing is the
sole legitimate government of China.
</P>
<P>
"Only by so doing can cross-strait exchanges and consultations
gradually resume and normalize," Siew said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the two sides had already held their first
high-level rendezvous in 1993, known as the Koo-Wang meeting, to lay
a framework for institutionalized cross-strait dialogue. Moreover, he
added, previous cross-strait talks on non-political administrative
and technical issues were quite helpful in the promotion of bilateral
cultural, educational, commercial and social exchanges.
</P>
<P>
"It is our unswerving stance that the two sides resume
institutionalized dialogue without any premises," Siew stressed,
adding that if mainland China shows sincerity and goodwill, Taiwan
will not oppose negotiations for an end to cross-strait hostility.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chiao Jen-ho, vice chairman and secretary general of
the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), said that if Beijing is really
sincere in its wish to resume talks with Taiwan, it should formally
express its intention through the proper channel.
</P>
<P>
Chiao suggested that mainland authorities ask the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) to send a
message to the SEF expressing their wish to discuss procedural
arrangements for a resumption of talks.
</P>
<P>
The SEF and ARATS are semi-official intermediary bodies founded
by their respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in
the absence of official ties.

ROC MULLS BUILDING INDIGENOUS SUBMARINES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Republic of China does not rule out
the possibility of building submarines in its own right, military
spokesman Gen. Kung Fan-ding said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kung was commenting on press reports that the ROC military plans
to commission the state-run China Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC) to build
1,000 to 2,000-ton conventional diesel-powered submarines.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters at a routine news conference that
self-sufficiency in defense technology has been the ROC's consistent
military build-up goal and policy.
</P>
<P>
"Under the policy of building our warships by ourselves, we do
not rule out the possibility of commissioning local shipbuilders to
build our own submarines," Kung explained.
</P>
<P>
Noting that submarines are critical to Taiwan's naval defense,
Kung said the military must conduct a comprehensive evaluation of all
related elements, including technology, market demand and economic
factors before negotiating a deal with prospective domestic
shipbuilders.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Chiang Chung-ling said earlier this year that
Taiwan is seeking to purchase submarines from foreign suppliers, but
so far no breakthrough has been achieved in this respect.
</P>
<P>
Due to pressure from rival Beijing, no major countries around the
world are expected to sell submarines to Taiwan in the next few
years, observers said.
</P>
<P>
If Taiwan finally decides to build submarines on its own, the
observers said, it may still face difficulties acquiring the
necessary technology.
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's news conference, Gen. Kung also denied reports
that Taiwan plans to purchase Russian-made Su-37 jet fighters to be
used as "enemy" planes for pilot training.
</P>
<P>
Kung said the ROC Air Force has only purchased US- and
French-made jet fighters because purchasing foreign-made warplanes
also requires the establishment of logistic support and repair and
maintenance systems, as well as related manpower training programs.
</P>
<P>
Kung further said Russia has not yet begun mass production of
Su-37s, adding that it will take further monitoring to fully evaluate
the fighter's performance and stability.

NICARAGUAN WORKERS TO HELP CONSTRUCTION OF HIGH-SPEED RAILWAY

<TEXT>
<P>
A high-ranking Taiwan labor affairs
officer confirmed on Tuesday that Nicaraguan workers will soon be
imported into Taiwan on a case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
Hsu Chieh-kuei, chairman of the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA),
said the Nicaraguans will most likely be employed on the high-speed
railway project, which is expected to start construction at the end
of this year at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
Hsu said the actual number of Nicaraguans and when they will join
Taiwan's labor force will need further consultations with the Foreign
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Foreign wire services reported that the number of imported
foreign laborers in Taiwan next year will be set at around 5,000,
with most of the quota going to Nicaragua but Hsu said no decision
has yet been made.
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguan ambassador Salvador Stadthagen visited Hsu to discuss
the matter. According to Hsu, while saying he agreed that most of the
Nicaraguan laborers should join the construction sector, Stadthagen
also expressed the hope that some of his countrymen can learn skills
in the textile or electronics sectors.
</P>
<P>
"The import of Nicaraguan laborers is a new test", Hsu said,
citing the language barrier, the technical level of the workers and
the expensive air fares as potential problems to overcome.
</P>
<P>
Hsu said that he hopes at least one out of 20 of the Nicaraguans
will be able to speak English, in order to reduce the communication
problems.

WTO DISPUTES REACH CENTURY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva,  Sept. 30 (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Geneva-based World Trade Organization
(WTO) -- in just a little more than two-and-a-half years of existence
-- has received its 100th trade dispute for resolution.
</P>
<P>
This rate of some 40 disputes a year represents a vote of
confidence by the 132 members in the improved dispute settlement
mechanism of the new organization.
</P>
<P>
The WTO's 100th dispute was a request for consultations by the
European Community with the United States regarding a US ban on
imports of EC poultry and poultry products.
</P>
<P>
Among the highlights of the WTO's record so far in dispute
settlements are the following:
</P>
<P>
-- About one-quarter of the disputes were resolved by the parties
themselves at the initial consultation stage;
</P>
<P>
-- Members are actively using a new feature in the WTO procedures
-- the possibility of appeal -- with all the panel reports issued so
far being brought to the appellate body for a final ruling;
</P>
<P>
-- The improved mechanism has enabled adoption by the Dispute

<P>
Australia on Tuesday destroyed more than
600,000 guns sold to the government for A$293 million under a
national gun buyback scheme, part of government efforts to prevent
gun-related crime.
</P>
<P>
The buyback scheme came partly as a result of the murder early
last year of 35 people by a crazed gunman at Port Arthur in Tasmania,
the worst incident of its kind anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
Crime experts believe the destruction of more than 600,000 guns
will help reduce serious crime by up to 20 percent in Australia.
</P>
<P>
The scheme will end Wednesday, after which those who have not
sold their weapons to the government will face severe punishment.

PRESS COMMENT ON BEIJING'S ATTEMPT TO DELAY TAIPEI'S WTO BID

Beijing Pulls Strings on ROC's WTO Bid
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's long march to the World Trade Organization has been so
tortuous and baffling that the American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei
tried to come to its help. AmCham President Jeffrey Williams led a
12-member delegation to Washington to lobby US government and
congressional leaders for Taiwan's entry into the WTO on Taiwan's
economic merits.
</P>
<P>
"The US should support (Taiwan's) immediate entry without regard
to linkages to any other countries or any other political
situations," Williams said.
</P>
<P>
...Taiwan has already finished negotiations on tariffs concession
talks with Hong Kong (a WTO member) regarding Taiwan's entry into the
WTO. Last week, Hong Kong made it known that it has decided to
postpone the signing of the bilateral agreement until "further
progress" is made by (Beijing) in its WTO bid.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's decision, made apparently in deference to Beijing's
wishes, would effectively dash Chinese-Taipei's hope of an early
entry.
</P>
<P>
...Hong Kong is not the only WTO contracting party bent on
blocking Taiwan's bid to be admitted first. Singapore is also
sticking to the 1992 understanding.
</P>
<P>
Even so, Taiwan should not slow down its pace in the race to the
WTO.
</P>
<P>
Washington, after all, calls the shots in the world body, and who
knows which of the two Chinas would get down to the wire first?

TAIWAN MAY IMPOSE COMPULSORY SAVINGS ON FOREIGN LABORERS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Sept.  30  (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan may seek to impose compulsory
savings on foreign laborers as a way to prevent irregularities such
as absconding, Taiwan's top labor affairs official said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hsu Chieh-kwei, chairman of the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA),
said he reached a consensus with labor affairs ministers from
Thailand and the Philippines recently during an APEC ministers'
meeting in Seoul on Taiwan's plan to force Filipino and Thai laborers
to save part of their earnings in Taiwan as part of a scheme to
dissuade them from running away.
</P>
<P>
The measure, which must be drafted and then passed by the
legislature, will be the first of its kind in the world if put into
force, Hsu noted.
</P>
<P>
Hsu said he had met with his counterparts from Thailand, the
Philippines and other Southeast Asian countries for talks on measures
to prevent foreign workers from fleeing their jobs, which has become
a major headache in Taiwan's bilateral labor relations.
</P>
<P>
According to a preliminary CLA plan, Thai and Filipino workers
will be asked to deposit part of their monthly salaries in time
savings accounts which cannot be drawn upon within three years. The
money plus interest will be paid when the workers legally leave their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
Thailand and the Philippines are the main sources of foreign
laborers in Taiwan, most of whom work in labor-intensive jobs such as
manufacturing, construction and as housemaids.

<P>
The popularity of Prime Minister John
Howard has plunged to its lowest level ever in the aftermath of
travel expense frauds by his ministers and staff, according to a
survey carried out exclusively for mass circulation newspaper The
Australian.
</P>
<P>
So far three ministers and three of his closest members of staff
have been forced to resign over the scandal.
</P>
<P>
The poll shows a dramatic slump in Howard's lead over opposition
leader Kim Beazley.
</P>
<P>
Howard's personal approval rating from the public poll plunged to
36 percent on September 26-28 from 42 percent on September 19-21,
while people dissatisfied with his performance jumped to 51 percent
from 47 percent during the same period.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Beazley's popularity rose to 44 percent from
41 percent and the percentage of those dissatisfied with his
performance also dropped to 37 percent from 39 percent during the
same period, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said the travel scandal will continue for some
time as the opposition Labor Party is expected to focus its attacks
on the matter in coming weeks.

<P>
The Australian government has launched a
prospectus of government-owned telecommunication giant Telstra for
public listing on November 17, with an estimated value of up to A$14
billion, the largest such floating in the country's history.
</P>
<P>
The winners for one-third of Telstra's public listing on the
Australian Stock Exchange will be about 2.3 million Australian
investors, mostly small retail investors.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister John Fahey confirmed on Monday that about 70
percent of the available stocks will go to retail investors in
Australia, with the rest going to foreign institutions.
</P>
<P>
Telstra shares are set between A$2.80 and A$3.30 per share.
</P>
<P>
Altogether about 4.288 billion shares -- 33 percent of Telstra --
will be publicly sold.
</P>
<P>
The prospectus also confirmed that shareholders will receive a
fully franked dividend of 13 cents a share for the 1998 financial
year, giving investors a yield of almost seven percent, much higher
than the bank interest rate of about 4.5 percent.

<P>
The Interior Affairs Commission of the
European Parliament declared Tuesday that terrorist organizations
such as Turkey's Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and Islamic
fundamentalists threaten the European Union's security.
</P>
<P>
In a draft prepared by the Interior Affairs Commission, it was
said that it was not only organizations such as the PKK in Turkey,
ETA in Greece and the IRA in Britain which threaten the security of
territories of the European Union member-states, but also Islamic
fundamentalists, according to the semi-official Anatolian news
agency.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the pressure put on Muslims living in European states
by fundamentalists, the draft commented that a "turmoil of concepts"
is being experienced. The draft also called for a serious stance to
be taken against those supporting terrorism, including Turkey's
previous ruling party the Islamic Welfare Party, which allegedly
supports radical Islamist organizations in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, with mass murders in Algeria, suicide bombings in
Israel and terrorist bus attacks in Egypt, German security officials
worry about an increasing readiness to resort to violence among an
extremist minority of Germany's Muslim population. Of an estimated 33
million Muslims in Europe, 2.3 million live in Germany.

The Philippine Senate will investigate the
alleged involvement of President Ramos and his aides in the hiding of
loot plundered by former President Ferdinand Marcos.
</P>
<P>
Senator Miriam Santiago sought the inquiry in view of reports
that American lawyer Robert Swift has presented documents in a

from the sale of Marcos gold bullion earlier this year has been
deposited in the Bank Julius Baer in Switzerland in the name of
Philippine Presidential Security Adviser Jose Almonte.

The same reports said Ramos maintains a separate account in the
same bank.

Swift and Filipino lawyer Rod Domingo Jr. represent the 10,000
human rights victims of the Marcos regime who have already won a
US$2.25 billion claim against the Marcos estate.

Santiago said Ramos and his aides have a lot of explaining to do,

DAILY ENVISIONS HONG KONG WITH MUZZLED PRESS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Ottawa, Sept. 29 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hong Kong's business-dominated legislature
will enact laws that restrict critical coverage of Beijing, a major
Canadian newspaper said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Globe and Mail's Anthony Keller said that like Singapore,
Hong Kong with a muzzled press and without democracy could continue
to be prosperous. But for its inhabitants, deprived of the right to
do anything other than make money, "it would also be considerably
less pleasant," he noted.
</P>
<P>
In the daily's "Free Expression" column, Keller said mainland
China's vague, sotto voce threats to the Hong Kong press tapped out
the beat: Don't insult senior Communist Party leaders, don't advocate
the independence of Taiwan or Tibet or Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The assistant editor of the Mail's editorial board observed that
for the Hong Kong press, it's not exactly business as usual, as they
are still trying to figure out just what Beijing will not allow. He
quoted Liu Kin-ming, op-ed page editor of the Hong Kong Economic
Times: "If the newsroom bosses sense an approaching landmine, they
simply shy away from it."
</P>
<P>
Keller said mainland China's nature and impulses as a
totalitarian state that does not countenance internal dissent, make
tolerance of critical media difficult. He quoted Joseph Lian, Hong
Kong Economic Journal editor, as observing that the communist
leaders' background is "guerrilla fighters hailing from Yunnan and
other places" who "have this mentality of seeing everyone as
enemies."
</P>
<P>
Another influential daily, The Ottawa Citizen, carried a long
article by the above-quoted Liu, entitled "Hong Kong's
`self-censorship' myth," with a subtitle that reads: "Editors Stoop
to do Beijing's Dirty Work."
</P>
<P>
Liu, vice chairman of the Hong Kong Journalists Association,
wrote that chief editors, senior managers and publishers have been
doing dirty work for Beijing to water down criticism and spike
offensive stories. "It's plain old censorship," Liu stressed,
correcting the misnomer "self-censorship."
</P>
<P>
Liu is not optimistic about the prospects for press freedom in
Hong Kong. "Chinese are not well-known for sticking their necks out.
And I am afraid Chinese journalists are no exception."
</P>
<P>
So he expected that at the end of the day, "people get the kind
of press they deserve and we get the kind of government we deserve."

MAC WELCOMES QIAN'S REMARKS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, Sept. 30 (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) spokesman
on Tuesday welcomed mainland Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen's remarks made a day earlier in which he called
for an opening of cross-strait political negotiations, saying that
the MAC is pleased that Beijing has finally responded to Taipei's
prompting.
</P>
<P>
MAC Vice Chairman Hsu Ke-sheng noted that it will be by no means
difficult for the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to resume their long
overdue talks. The two sides should reopen talks right away through
the existing negotiation channel without setting any preconditions,
he added.
</P>
<P>
During a reception marking the 48th founding anniversary of the
PRC, Qian called on Taiwan authorities to "demonstrate their
sincerity and exchange views with (mainland) China regarding the
arrangement of the procedures of the cross-strait political
negotiations."
</P>
<P>
"We demand that the Taiwan authorities lift the restrictions on
the development of cross-strait economic and trade relations," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Responding to Qian's remarks, Hsu said Taipei and Beijing should
return to the negotiating table as early as possible under the
framework set up by Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the quasi-official
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and Wang Daohan, chairman of the
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS), in April 1993 when the two met in Singapore for the first
ice-breaking talks after a hiatus of some four decades.
</P>
<P>
Hsu reiterated Taipei's stance that the two sides meet through
the existing channel for negotiations on either technical matters or
political issues.
</P>
<P>
Hsu stressed, however, that Qian made the remarks only in his
speech rather than through the formal channels. He urged the Beijing
authorities to conduct formal negotiations through the SEF and the
ARATS.

Philippine President Fidel Ramos on Tuesday
branded as the height of "a conspiracy of falsehood and fabrication"
allegations that he has a secret Swiss bank account.
</P>
<P>
"I never had a Swiss bank account," a visibly irked Ramos told
reporters who asked for his side of the story on allegations by
American lawyer Robert Swift, representing human rights victims of
the Marcos regime.
</P>
<P>
"This report about my allegedly having a Swiss bank account which
I have newly opened is completely untrue... I never had a Swiss bank
account... this must be part of a conspiracy that some irresponsible
and spurious and maybe criminally inclined people are trying to bring
upon the Filipino audience," Ramos said.
</P>

Chairman Magtangol Gunigundo of the Presidential Commission on
Good Government (PCGG), has been working for the last five years to
try to recover billions of dollars-worth of ill-gotten Marcos wealth
believed deposited in Swiss banks.

BEIJING POISED TO TOTALLY DECOMMUNIZE CHINA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Ottawa,  Sept.  29  (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Canadian observer said Monday that
China's Communist leaders will continue Deng Xiao- ping's titanic
revolution to totally decommunize China and make it the world's
leading nation in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Eric Margolis, foreign affairs analyst for the Sun newspapers,
stuck to his comment in February that future hisotrians would one day
call China's tiny giant (Deng) not only a far more important leader
than Mao Tse-tung, but "one of our century's greatest men."
</P>
<P>
He said that view was "most unpopular" and he caught a lot of
flak from both the right and the left. But he cited a World Bank
study to show the triumphant scale of Deng's achievement. He highly
praised Deng for dis- mantling Mao's cruel, inefficient system of
state serfdom and unleashing the enormous energy and talents of the
intelligent, industrious Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Margolis called China a sleeping giant that had awakened, as
predicted by Napoleon.
</P>
<P>
However, he also saw another reality about China: It has order,
but no law, the necessary foundation for the free market economy.
"After 50 years of revolution, many Chinese are deeply confused and
uncertain about their future in a capitalist world," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Communist leadership's latest decision to close or privatize
its 305,000 state-owned enterprises is "the last battle of
de-communization" which will require strong, autocratic central
control, he said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that few democracies could perform such
excruciatingly painful surgery on themselves. When and if China's
collective leadership manages to get this iron ablbatross off the
nation's neck, "I Believe they will begin moderate political
liberalization," he said.
</P>
<P>
Beastly as the Chinese are to their dissidents, Muslims and
Tibetans, Margolis urged the West to be patient with Beijing. China
is already flying at Mach 10 -- any faster amd it could fall apart in
mid-air, he warned.

TAIWAN PC PRODUCTION EXPECTED TO REACH 10 MILLION THIS YEAR
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the increasing development of the
computer hardware industry, Taiwan's annual production of personal
computers (PCs) is expected to break the 10 million unit mark at the
end of this year, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The statistics, released recently by the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS), show that Taiwan produced
5.8 million PCs during the first six months of this year,
representing a 45.3 percent rise in comparison with the same period
of last year.
</P>
<P>
The DGBAS statistics also show that the accumulated value of this
production reached US$5.4 billion in the six-month period, up 58.6
percent from the year-earlier level.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's computer industry has been enjoying exciting growth in
PC production, including desktop and notebook PCs, over the past five
years, with total PC production surging to 9.46 million units in 1996
from 2.8 million in 1992, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The figures represent an average 36.2 percent annual growth for
PC production on the island, the DGBAS indicated.
</P>
<P>
In terms of total production value, the DGBAS figures indicate a
jump to US$8.7 billion in 1996 from 1992's US$2.1 billion, with an
annual growth average of 42.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the statistics also show that although desktop PCs
enjoyed a larger annual output than notebook PCs over the past five
years, the latter had an average 44.7 percent growth per annum,
higher the former's 31.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The DGBAS said, however, that most of this production was in the
form of original equipment manufacturer (OEM), accounting for 69
percent of the entire output during the Jan.-June period of this
year, reflecting the fact that Taiwan computer makers still need to
make more efforts in R&amp;D for their own products.

Panama, an ROC ally in Central America,
will speak out for the Republic of China's bid to rejoin the United
Nations before the UN General Assembly ends its current session on
Oct. 3, Vice Premier and Foreign Minister John Chang said on Tuesday
at the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
In response to an opposition legislator's criticism that Panama,
despite intense courting by President Lee Teng-hui during his Latin
American trip earlier this month, failed to raise its voice for the
ROC at the ongoing UN session, Chang said Panama has assured him that
she has never dropped her support for Taiwan and will have her envoy
to the UN speak out on the island's behalf before the end of the UN
session.
</P>
<P>
Panama and Paraguay, two ROC allies visited by Lee during his
trip, have thus far failed to offer support to the ROC at the UN.
</P>
<P>
Answering another legislator's interpellation, Premier Vincent
Siew said that ROC's participation in the System for Central America
Intergration (SICA), a proposed regional body to comprise six Latin
American states, should be approved by the Legislative Yuan when the
system comes into existence.
</P>
<P>
Following a summit meeting in San Salvador on Sept. 13 with
leaders of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua
and Belize, Lee singed a joint communique in which the ROC agreed to
be a non-regional member of SICA.
</P>

Chang said that SICA will provide a valuable forum for the ROC to

MOFA WELCOMES SIGNING OF EXTRADITION ACCORD WITH US

<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
said on Tuesday that Taipei welcomes the United States' positive
attitude toward the signing of an extradition treaty with Taiwan,
even though the MOFA has not yet been officially notified by the US
government in this regard.
</P>
<P>
MOFA spokesman Roy Wu said the ROC welcomes the signing of such
an agreement since the two countries have maintained close
cooperative relations in crime-busting efforts, but lack the laws to
govern these efforts.
</P>
<P>
Wu said Taipei has on many occasions discussed with relevant US
officials the signing of an extradition accord so that the two sides
can join forces to curb cross-border crimes, but added that no
decisive progress has been made so far.
</P>
<P>
The MOFA is hoping for an extradition agreement to cover
criminals involved in drug trafficking, arms smuggling and organized
crime, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
According to wire service reports, the US is preparing to sign an
extradition treaty with Taiwan. "Discussions on this matter have been
going on for some time, but it's not something upon which we could
reach consensus immediately," said Lloyd Neighbors, spokesman for the
American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), the de facto Washington embassy
in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on developments in a cross-border drug trafficking
case concerning ROC national Huang Kuang-chieh, Wu said the case has
entered the judicial process and the ROC will take care of it.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the ROC's stance on a US demand that Huang be
repatriated from Taiwan to America to face trial, Wu said the ROC
government has turned down the request on the grounds that the two
countries maintain no extradition treaty.

<P>
In a dramatic gesture to underline his
resolve to run in the race for county magistrate, Chang Jung-wei,
council speaker of central Taiwan's Yunlin County on Tuesday declared
he is quitting the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) after failing to win the
party nomination for the race.
</P>
<P>
Chang announced his decision amid rumors that the KMT is to
punish its members who insist on running in the year-end local
elections in defiance of party wishes.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after returning his party membership
certificate to local KMT headquarters, Chang said he is resigning
because that will make it easier for him to convince his supporters
that he will not be dropped from the race at a later date because of
KMT pressure, which will make it easier for him to solicit votes.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the KMT for not putting him on the party ticket
despite his staunch efforts to canvass party support during numerous
previous elections.
</P>
<P>
Chang's resignation signifies the failure of the KMT to reconcile
three party hopefuls for the county magistrate race in Yunlin after
the party chose provincial assemblyman Su Wen-hsiung as its
candidate.
</P>
<P>
Su told reporters after learning of Chang's resignation that it
represents a boost for his candidacy because it avoids any question
of a party split.
</P>
<P>
Another KMT hopeful, Ou Ming-hsian, said that same day that he
will not quit the party but will instead seek its approval to allow
him to stand as a candidate in parallel with Su.
