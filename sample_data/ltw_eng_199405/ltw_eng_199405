 TRAVEL PLANNER: Canadian Rivers, Europe Deals, Airline Packages 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Canadian River Expeditions offers a change from the usual
theme-park vacation: five 11-day float trips from July 1 to Aug. 31
that take families through some of British Columbia's most scenic
territory. Travel for these Chilcotin-Fraser tours is by yacht,
seaplane and raft through deep fjords where bald eagles wheel through
the sky and the water is filled with seals, whales and some of the
biggest salmon in the world. Highlights include winging on a seaplane
over icefields, hiking trips and fishing expeditions. The raft rides
are not white knuckle adventures -- it's mostly gentle floating.
</P>
<P>
A few hours a day are spent on the water, with the rest of the time
devoted to guided sightseeing and nature walks. Price is $2,325,
including round-trip airfare to Vancouver, meals and accommodations,
as well as camping gear. Call your travel agent or (604) 738-4449.
</P>
<P>
Trafalgar Tours is offering 16 ``Best of ...'' trips to Europe for
1994. ``Best of Britain,'' for example, takes in all of England and
Scotland in 15 days for $1,099. A 14-day ``Best of France'' trip for
$1,260 covers the country from north to south, including Monaco, and a
``Best of Switzerland'' itinerary combines Zurich, St. Moritz,
Zermatt, Geneva, Interlaken and Lucerne in 9 nine days for $799. Other
packages are available for Spain, Italy, Germany, Austria, Holland,
Norway, Sweden and Denmark, Belgium and Holland, among others. Prices
exclude airfare. Call your travel agent or (800) 457-6891.
</P>
<P>
Airlines are offering, or continuing, special price packages for
travelers flying to Europe, the Mideast and the Far East. IPI World
Travel and Delta Airlines, for example, are rolling back prices for a
``China Highlights'' tour -- 14 days, departing in November and
December, to Bejing, Shanghai, Xian Guilin and Hong Kong -- for $2,650,
including airfare from the East Coast. Delta also runs several package
tours to European cities: a ``Parisien Spree'' of 6 six nights,
breakfasts and a Seine River cruise, for $1,199 per person, double
occupancy, round-trip from New York, and a ``Romantic Rome'' trip,
with similar features, for just $1,289. El Al meanwhile sponsors a
spring vacation package that includes five nights' accommodations in
Tel Aviv, daily breakfasts and free rental car, for just $1,049
round-trip from New York City. Call your travel agent or IPI at (212)
953-6010 or El Al Israeli Airlines at (800) EL AL SUN.
</P>
<P>
Take a long weekend this summer and enjoy one of several two- to
four-day walking tours of New York's historic Hudson Valley from High
Land Flings Footloose Holidays. Their ``Dutch Treat'' trip, June 3-5,
follows in the footsteps of colonial settlers through three National
Historic landmark villages where stone houses built by Dutch and
Huguenot builders in the 17th century still stand. You'll walk
America's oldest street in New Paltz, Main Street in Hurley and the
Stockade area of Kingston, where the state's constitution was written
and adopted, and also visit the 1676 Senate House. Other walks cover
the area of Lake Minnewaska, Overlook Mountain near Woodstock and the
northeastern Catskills. Prices range from $350 per person, double
occupancy, for two-day walks to $699 for a four-day trip. Call (800)
453-6665.

 Are Frequent-Flier Miles Worth It? 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Are frequent-flier awards worth all the trouble travelers sometimes
go through to rack up enough miles for a free trip?
</P>
<P>
Not according to a lengthy piece in the May issue of Worth
magazine, which concludes that the programs are vastly over-rated.
</P>
<P>
Then why do so many banks, rental-car companies, long-distance
phone services and hotels reward their frequent customers with airline
miles rather than cash discounts or other perks?
</P>
<P>
Simple, says Worth contributing editor Jeff Blyskal, in the article
entitled ``The Frequent-Flier Fallacy.'' Companies want to give
premiums that combine the greatest perceived value with the lowest
possible outlay, and frequent-flier miles are the perfect solution.
</P>
<P>
Each freebie ticket costs an airline only $11 to $42, Blyskal
calculates. The average discount to passengers amounts to 3.3 percent
 -- almost 2 percent less than you get by being a valued customer of
Sears, he writes. His data showed the cost to a traveler for each
award ranges from $929 with Southwest Airlines to $7,527 with Delta,
which requires higher-than-average mileage minimums to collect a
freebie. The dollar value of the freebies ranges from $56 with
Southwest to $208 with United. The effective discounts passengers reap
range from 1.5 percent (USAir) to 6 percent (Southwest). Hotel
frequent-guest programs typically provide a 5 percent discount, as do
numerous retailers' programs, including Sears Best Customer, Blyskal
found.
</P>
<P>
The number of dollars spent to earn a domestic freebie -- usually
available after flying 20,000 miles -- typically ranges from $3,626 to
$6,555, he said. (On Southwest Airlines, the average passenger gets a
free trip after 7,104 miles because freebies are awarded by that
carrier after eight round trips rather than a mileage minimum.)
Blyskal says his accounting system gives airlines the benefit of the
doubt in every aspect and was based on the programs as they stand now
 -- before the program devaluations most airlines plan starting next
year.
</P>
<P>
The payback is even worse from affinity credit cards, he says,
which generally award one frequent-flier mile per dollar charged. This
translates to an effective discount of just 0.7 percent on $20,000 in
credit card spending needed to earn the $152 in value of the average
free ticket, Blyskal figures.
</P>
<P>
All in all, he says, to earn these paltry awards, travelers spend
more on air travel in the first place than they have to because they
often shun low-cost airlines that do not participate in frequent-flier
programs. For example, he says, to earn 20,000 miles on United, a
traveler would have to make 14 Newark-Chicago round trips at a cost of
$12,348. Fourteen round trips would cost just a quarter of that -- 
$2,912 -- on upstart Kiwi International Airlines, which offers
consistently low rates but no frequent-flier perks, he says.
</P>
<P>
You say you don't care about the price because your boss pays for a
lot of your flights and lets you rake in the resulting frequent-flier
perks? Don't let the company bean-counters get wind of the fact that
you could be sent on 45 more Newark-Chicago business trips for what
it's costing to ensure that you get your perk, Blyskal cautions.
</P>
<P>
Add on the annual fees charged for some affinity cards, not to
mention high interest on purchases -- and maybe a computer program to
help you manage your miles. And, of course, most travelers who earn a
freebie purchase a ticket for their spouse or companion to accompany
them -- which often isn't available at any discount whatsoever. Plus
the hardest cost to quantify -- which may be the biggest cost of all,
Blyskal says: the time many fliers spend obsessing over maximizing
mileage for minimum payback.
</P>
<P>
His advice? Focus on service and low fares, not a possible freebie
you may never collect.

 TRAVEL NOTES: Island Crime, Legroom Aloft, Shipshape 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The State Department is taking a wait-and-see attitude after an
American tourist was seriously injured in an attack May 10 by a man
with a machete on a remote stretch of beach in the Cayman Islands.
</P>
<P>
The State Department issues information about
</P>
<P>
petty street crime, but not violence, in the Caribbean islands it
groups as the British West Indies. ``We're looking at whether this
remains an isolated incidence or if it's an indication of a threat to
other tourists,'' said Gary Sheaffer, department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
At the opposite end of the Caribbean, on the island of Trinidad off
the coast of Venezuela, a honeymooning Canadian couple was found
beaten and dead on a beach May 11, with their valuables nearby in
their unlocked rental car, a Canadian government spokeswoman
confirmed. Trinidadian and Canadian police are still investigating,
she said.
</P>
<P>
``This is the first time this has happened to Canadians in
Trinidad. It's probably a good idea not to frequent deserted beaches,
whether it's Trinidad or Florida,'' said Lely Campbell-Ferreira.
Sheaffer said the U.S. State Department was not aware of the incident.
</P>
<P>
Now you have legroom, now you don't. TWA, which created its
much-advertised Comfort Class in coach last year by taking 40 seats
out of its cabins, is putting 34 seats back in planes flying its most
popular routes this summer.
</P>
<P>
The airline is re-installing the seats on only 10 planes (the
747-100s) out of its fleet of 189 ``to meet high market demand'' for
the summer, mostly on overseas flights, said spokesman Don Fleming.
The rest of the fleet will retain Comfort Class. And TWA will
re-evaluate seating in the fall and could very well take the seats out
again.
</P>
<P>
Most of the flights with more legs and less room this summer fly
out of New York: to Athens, Rome, Madrid, Milan, Paris, New York to
St. Louis to Honolulu, one flight daily from New York to Los Angeles
and St. Louis to Gatwick, London. Ask about Comfort Class before
making a reservation.
</P>
<P>
Buzzwords that Cunard honchos recently bandied about as they
described the upcoming $45 million refurbishment of the cruise line's
flagship, the Queen Elizabeth 2, which made its maiden transatlantic
voyage in 1969, were ``enhance'' and ``flow.''
</P>
<P>
Which translates into opening up more spaces all over the ship:
adding a second-story deck promenade to give the Midship Lobby an
atriumlike look, eliminating the odd dead-end corridor, redesigning
the directional signs (all ``to enhance passenger flow'') and adding a
new observation lounge at the rear of the ship with panoramic windows
yielding an uninterrupted view.
</P>
<P>
The new art-deco-, neo-classical-inspired decor will be ripe with
texture, replete with marble, resounding in architectural detail and
rich in earthtones,
</P>
<P>
all ``enhanced'' with the QE2's memorabilia, such as old charts and
lots of regal art. All 900 cabins will be refurbished and all
bathrooms rebuilt. Ditto on restaurants, where quality of service
will, of course, be ``enhanced.''
</P>
<P>
The refurbishment will commence Nov. 30 and take about 30 days,
Cunard officials said. So will all this ``enhance'' prices? ``The cost
of cruising has never gone down,'' noted Navin Sawnhey, senior vice
president of marketing. The QE2 now offers a range of fares and
cruises, with its transatlantic voyage priced from $1,395 to $10,745,
per person, double, with return air travel.
</P>
<P>
You can't party all night long in Greece anymore. Nightclubs, bars
and restaurants formerly with all-night entertainment now must close
by 2:30 a.m. in summer, 2 a.m. in winter and 3:30 a.m. on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
So you won't be sleepless in Seattle, the Seattle-King County
Visitors Bureau is operating a free reservation service: (800)
535-7071.
</P>
<P>
A new service offers travelers a fax mailbox to retrieve stored
faxes with any machine by calling a toll-free number in the United
States. For rate info, call AlphaNet Telecom at (212) 932-1554.

 ON THE LIGHTER SIDE: Private Lives, Public Endorphins 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I think there are several reasons why, in polite company, we rarely
talk about our discharges.
</P>
<P>
I mention this in connection with endorphins, which, I notice,
people have begun to discuss with relative strangers, just the way
people formerly discussed their cholesterol at parties.
</P>
<P>
Do you remember that?
</P>
<P>
Outwardly normal person: ``Do you know what my cholesterol was last
week?
</P>
<P>
Myself: ``Sir, I do not.''
</P>
<P>
Outwardly normal person: ``It was (mentions very good cholesterol
count).''
</P>
<P>
Myself: ``That is good.''
</P>
<P>
Outwardly normal person: ``What, you don't believe me?''
</P>
<P>
Myself: ``I say no such thing.''
</P>
<P>
Outwardly normal person: ``If there's a problem here, I know a
medical lab that's open until 8. We'll take my Q45 and I'll get
re-tested and you can see exactly what my cholesterol is.''
</P>
<P>
I was never sure about how to participate in these conversations,
because, first of all, I would never say ``my cholesterol.'' My creed
is that cholesterol belongs to the universe or the Great Spirit. We're
just borrowing it for a little while.
</P>
<P>
Which raises a question: Let's say you do get your cholesterol
down. Where does it go? Is it just out there, sticking to the faces of
babies in perambulators and gumming up the wings of the great-crested
kingfisher?
</P>
<P>
Now it is endorphins. Endorphins are a sore subject with me,
because I'm pretty sure I don't have any. Other people do, and
sometimes they seem to be bragging about them.
</P>
<P>
``I was up on the Nordic Combat machine last night, and I had it
set at level eight, which simulates hand-to-hand combat with a huge,
grunting, mead-addled Hun. Boy, after 45 minutes, those endorphins
were really flowing.''
</P>
<P>
The idea is that endorphins are chemicals that, under certain
circumstances, begin squirting out of somewhere inside your head and
making your brain feel better.
</P>
<P>
I picture the system as comparable to those nozzles in highly
evolved produce sections, where a soothing mist sighs out over the
kale and the arugula, like the strange fogs that gather 'round Ben
Bulben's bare head. I have been known to tarry there for extra
moments, watching the wet shades and phantoms dance over the ruby
swiss chard.
</P>
<P>
Endorphins are supposed to calm the mind and kill pain and produce
peak experiences, such as the ``runner's high.''
</P>
<P>
I have never had a runner's high or a swimmer's high or any
particular reaction to strenuous exercise except the keen sense of how
exhausted I was and how eager I was to stop swimming or running.
</P>
<P>
And I know full well that my brain is a tightly wired network of
fright sensors, discomfort gauges and humming monitors of
self-concern. There is nothing up there that coats my fevered mind in
soothing syrup, and even if there were it would just short everything
out.
</P>
<P>
So maybe I don't have endorphins, but even if I did, would I
mention them? My normal assumption is that there is no widespread
appetite for information about my secretions.
</P>
<P>
``My gall bladder was on the job yesterday afternoon. I was pumping
some big-time bile, emulsifying those fats in my duodenum. Bless my
soul.''
</P>
<P>
To the endorphin-proud, I am often tempted to point out that one
theory about endorphins is that they were originally bestowed upon
animals, such as cats, for whom sex is excruciatingly painful. They
were a little payoff, nature's way of saying, ``Thanks for
perpetuating the species even though that felt like being probed by a
briar patch.''
</P>
<P>
Under those circumstances, I maintain that the civilized course is
to live with pain and terror. If things get intolerable, there's
always the option of scootching the chicory aside and lying down for a
while next to the red leaf lettuce.

 Simple Rules to Make Visiting Disney World Much More Enjoyable 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By conventional wisdom, there are certain things you simply don't
do, right?
</P>
<P>
You don't drink on an empty stomach. You don't spit into the wind
and, of course, you never escort the bride's father to the bachelor
party.
</P>
<P>
But for parents of young children, one don't has always
outdistanced all the rest.
</P>
<P>
You don't go to Disney World during school holidays.
</P>
<P>
People who have disobeyed this commandment litter Orlando like lost
souls, their hollow eyes bespeaking the drubbing they have taken at
the Tourist Capital of the Universe.
</P>
<P>
Their children drag behind, in tears, muttering, ``We'll be good
now, Daddy. We promise. Please. Can we wait two more hours on another
line?''
</P>
<P>
School holidays at Disney World are crowded with a capital C, chaos
with, well, a capital K. The lines are legendary, the sun is hot and
the living uneasy.
</P>
<P>
But I did it. I survived. I even had a good time, and you can, too
 -- even if you visit at a peak period, such as the three summer months.
</P>
<P>
All you have to do is follow some simple advice, which I'm sharing
on the condition that you don't go blabbing it to all the neighbors.
Because the secret here is to go where they ain't and, believe you me,
at Disney, an incautious word about an empty attraction can turn the
Road Less Traveled into a Superhighway faster than you can say Jiminy
Cricket.
</P>
<P>
Rule No. 1, then, is plan ahead.
</P>
<P>
This trite little maxim will seem biblical in depth when you've
watched The Unprepared spin out of control like weather vanes in the
wind.
</P>
<P>
I myself had envisioned being a bit laid back about the whole
affair until I mentioned my vacation to a few friends: ``I'm planning
on bringing the wife and my 5-year-old daughter down to Disney World
this Easter.''
</P>
<P>
They looked at me as if I were a few sandwiches short of a picnic.
</P>
<P>
That's when I finally realized that you don't approach Disney World
like a visit to an amusement park. You approach it like the invasion
of a small country. Think of it as the Duchy of Grand Fenwick and
begin preparing your counterattack on the Mouse That Roared.
</P>
<P>
Of course, if you are a Zen master, and view crowds as a natural
event, like waves in the ocean, skip ahead to Tip No. 2. But the rest
of you, buy a guide book and start reading. Otherwise you will be
trampled by those who know that you have to be at Dumbo by 10 a.m. to
avoid an hour's wait.
</P>
<P>
If you don't believe me, listen to Bob Sehingler, whose guide to
Disneyland I manage to find and use. ``It's easy to spot the free
spirits at Disneyland,'' he wrote, ``particularly at opening time.
While everybody else is stampeding to Splash Mountain or Star Tours,
they are the ones standing in a cloud of dust puzzling over the park
map. Later, they are the people running around like chickens in a
thunderstorm trying to find an attraction with less than a
forty-minute wait.''
</P>
<P>
Convinced? Then make sure you abide by Rule No.2. Get up early.
</P>
<P>
How early? Sick early.
</P>
<P>
Dawn is too late at Disney World. One morning our wake-up call at
the Grand Floridian, a Disney hotel, came at 5:45 a.m. The hotel
operator couldn't help laughing at me. It was pitch black outside. The
drunks still hadn't gotten home.
</P>
<P>
But you know what? There were plenty of people ahead of us when we
boarded the monorail for the Magic Kingdom at 6:30 a.m., taking
advantage of a 90-minute early opening for Disney Resort guests.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Up Main Street we streamed, past street lamps still lit from the
night before. Everyone tried so hard to pretend they weren't running.
It looked like a huge trial heat for the Olympic walking team.
</P>
<P>
All that paranoia paid off, however. In the next hour we were able
to board four or five rides that had been swamped the previous
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
One hour after the parks open to the general public, major
attractions have major lines. At Space Mountain, Splash Mountain and
Thunder Mountain Railroad in the Magic Kingdom, Spaceship Earth in
Epcot and Star Tours at MGM, you can expect a line of at least half an
hour.
</P>
<P>
At Dumbo, forget it.
</P>
<P>
This dinky little ride featuring that darling little elephant draws
children like flies. I waited 45 minutes one day for a 45-second ride.
</P>
<P>
If you have to ride rides in the afternoon, try to do so during
parade times, when lines go from maddening to manageable.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
To make the trip back to the hotel as painless as possible,
however, remember Rule No. 3. Stay as close as possible to the parks.
</P>
<P>
This can seem silly when the Budgetbear Hotel 10 miles away is
offering Hoedown Weekend at five bucks a night. Believe me, that will
not seem like a bargain for long. After becoming disgusted at the
honky tonk sprawl that sprung up around Disneyland, Father Disney
decreed it would not happen again. So Disney World is surrounded by
virgin acres. The trip to the Magic Kingdom from the highway is itself
a five-mile ride, complete with tollbooth. Then you have to take a
tram to the booths to buy tickets and then a boat ride to an
admissions gate, and then you have to traverse Main Street USA to get
to any real rides. This can be an exhausting experience.
</P>
<P>
You can avoid a lot of the hassle by staying in one of the Disney
hotels, which run the gamut from reasonable to ridiculous in price.
Disney resort guests not only receive free transportation to the parks
but also enjoy the early opening times. And resort guests never have
to worry about the parking lots closing.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
We stayed at the Grand Floridian, Disney's deluxe hotel, which is
but a five-minute monorail ride from the Magic Kingdom and about 20
minutes by monorail or bus from Epcot and MGM.
</P>
<P>
The Floridian set us back about $350 a night. But my theory was
that, on a day when the crowds make me retreat to my room, it would be
best if the room did not look like a small cell at Rikers Island. The
Floridian delivered most of what I wanted from a luxury hotel. It
reminded me of the racetrack at Saratoga -- all red turrets and
Victorian balustrades -- after Mary Poppins had taken over and banned
all the betting. Very clean. Very proper. Lots of people in knickers.
Our room was large, salmon in color and nicely furnished.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
At some point you just have to get away from the crowds, sit down,
eat and relax. Arranging that is something of a feat, however, in peak
periods when lines for a simple soda may stretch back to bygone days.
One way to beat the problem is to apply Rule No. 4. Book restaurants
early. Resort guests can book up to three days in advance; others up
to one day.
</P>
<P>
Tip No. 5. Be flexible.
</P>
<P>
Some things you just cannot plan. Rides break down. People have
strange reactions to food and find themselves, as my daughter calls
it, ``disembarfing.'' You just have to deal with it.

<HEADLINE>
 ``Leonard Bernstein,'' by Humphrey Burton (Doubleday, $25, 594 pp.) 
 Reviewed by Steve Metcalf 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leonard Bernstein once scoffed at the notion that there is such a
thing as a single, ideal, unimprovable musical interpretation of a
piece of music.
</P>
<P>
We should be similarly skeptical of the proposition, already put
forward by a few early reviewers, that Humphrey Burton's fat new
biography of Bernstein is somehow ``definitive.''
</P>
<P>
Definitive it's not, both because the idea itself is meaningless
and because the life in question is too complex and too recently ended
to be definitively written about.
</P>
<P>
The nearly-600-page ``Leonard Bernstein'' can, however, make this
considerable, if limited, claim: It's the best we have so far.
</P>
<P>
The book is dutiful, exhaustive (sometimes to a fault), respectful
without being fawning. And to deal quickly with an issue that all
Lenny fans will be unworthily wondering about, it handles Bernstein's
complicated sexual life -- a sort of strenuous omnisexuality, it seems,
with a steady pull toward homosexuality -- in an unblinking but
decently compassionate way.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the book is not very excitingly written and
could have benefited from some tighter editing.
</P>
<P>
It's a portrait, a sketch, written by a longtime friend -- a TV
producer, not a musician -- who's smart, unsentimental, who has had
access to piles of important letters.
</P>
<P>
And such letters!

<P>
Tender, hope-filled youthful notes to Aaron Copland, or his
parents; letters of euphoria and gratitude to his early mentor Serge
Koussevitzky at the Boston Symphony Orchestra; letters of steadily
rising confidence to his lifelong confidante, Helen Coates; letters of
almost unbearable conflict to his finacee and later wife, Felicia, as
the desperate-to-be-loved Bernstein gropes with the -- for him -- 
especially problematic possibilities of marriage and monogamy.
</P>
<P>
Burton gently debunks a few press-agent Lennyisms that have wafted
unchallenged into the general consciousness. One of these concerns
Bernstein's supposed roots in jazz. Unlike, say, Andre Previn, who is
a certifiable jazz man, Bernstein was really not steeped in the
tradition, a fact that Burton addresses crisply:
</P>
<P>
``Bernstein's knowledge of jazz was cheerful and enthusiastic but
essentially superficial. Jazz musicians never thought much of his
gifts as an improviser.''
</P>
<P>
Burton also calls attention to Bernstein's dainty total output as a
composer, a fact that Bernstein himself often rued later in life.
Burton points out that between 1957, after ``West Side Story ''
opened, and 1971, when his ``Mass'' had its premiere at the Kennedy
Center in Washington, Bernstein managed just two works: the
``Kaddish'' Symphony and ``Chichester Psalms.'' The two works together
total less than an hour of music.
</P>
<P>
Burton also offers a brief but instructive and clarifying view of
the infamous 1969 party for the Black Panthers, held at the Bernstein
apartment on New York's Park Avenue. Tom Wolfe's subsequent New York
Magazine piece about the party coined the smug term ``radical chic''
and tried to offer Bernstein as a comical, desperate figure, or, as
Burton paraphrases it, a ``naive bumbler who hobnobbed with
terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
The important, often overlooked truth was that it was Felicia's
party, and Lenny merely staggered into it. That Wolfe's piece, which
looks increasingly weak and smart-alecky as the years go by, was able
to create such a stir is testimony to the then-novelty of what has
since become a journalistic commonplace: the sanctimonious,
questionably motivated trashing of the famous.
</P>
<P>
The book's treatment of Bernstein's last years -- publicly lionized,
privately an impulsive, reckless widower -- is touching. We feel the
regret, the self-doubt, the overextended emotional resources, but
also, finally, the greatness, a verdict that had long been withheld in
some quarters but which by the end had become nearly unamimous.
</P>
<P>
Burton's book gives us, in sum, the first real full-length,
intellectually worthy picture of Bernstein the man -- endearing,
effusive, exasperating, irreplaceable.
</P>
<P>
It's a man who gave classical music a humanity it needed and still
needs, a man to whom a friend could send a telegram -- on the occasion
of Lenny's first audience with the pope -- that read in its entirety:
``REMEMBER: THE RING, NOT THE LIPS.''

 BOOKS FOR KIDS: Gentle Tales Can Put Kids to Sleep 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is ``Goodnight Moon'' making you loony? Does the phrase, ``And a
comb and a brush and a bowl full of mush,'' run 'round your brain like
some Lite Mixed Variety tune piped into the dentist's office?
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's time to experiment with some new bedtime fare. Oh, don't
desert the great green room of Margaret Wise Brown's classic. Just
supplement ``Goodnight Moon'' with some other books that have a
going-to-bed theme. Here are a few of the newer ones:
</P>
<P>
My favorite is ``Good Night, Gorilla,'' by Peggy Rathman (G.P.
Putnam's Sons, $12.95, 36 pages, ages 1-4). After sharing it with a
giggling toddler, you'll wonder why more picture books don't have a
sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
The text is incredibly simple. A sleepy zoo keeper is making his
last round, saying ``good night'' to each of the animals as he walks
past the cages. First on his route is the gorilla, which
surreptitiously snatches the key ring from the zoo keeper's belt.
</P>
<P>
The gorilla unlocks his cage and follows the keeper through the
zoo. As soon as the keeper says, ``Good night, Elephant,'' the gorilla
uses a color-coded key to release the elephant. The same thing happens
with the lion, hyena, giraffe and armadillo, who fall into line behind
the gorilla.
</P>
<P>
Soon they're all tiptoeing behind the keeper as he walks to his
house, opens the door and heads down the hall to his bedroom. When he
climbs into bed next to his sleeping wife, she stirs and says, ``Good
night, dear.''
</P>
<P>
Imagine her surprise when each of the animals, curling up for the
night in her bedroom, responds, ``Good night.'' On the next page,
actually a double-page spread of inky black, all we see are the whites
of her frightened eyes.
</P>
<P>
She flips on the light, and the animals flash sheepish grins her
way. But she gets up and leads them back to their cages anyway.
Everyone settles into the right cage -- the elephant with his Babar
doll, the armadillo with his stuffed Ernie from Sesame Street.
Everyone, that is, except gorilla. Kids will cheer his great escape,
sensing that it just might be a nightly occurrence.
</P>
<P>
``Good Night!'' written by Claire Masurel, illustrated by Marie H.
Henry (Chronicle, $12.95, 32 pages, ages 2-6) is about nighttime
rituals. As a little girl gets ready for bed, she gathers up all her
dolls and stuffed animals.
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt who's in charge. ``Silly Oscar,'' she tells the
clown doll. ``It's not time to play cards! It's time to go to bed.''
Her stuffed dragon can't watch any more TV. Her rag doll can't read
any more books. This little girl is giving the orders, and kids will
enjoy sharing her sense of empowerment.
</P>
<P>
When dogs dream, their legs pumping like pistons, are they catching
squirrels and nabbing rabbits? Naw. ``Dreaming'' by Bobette McCarthy
(Candlewick Press, $12.95, 32 pages, ages 3 and up) stars a salty dog
who dreams of sailing the ocean blue.
</P>
<P>
His wicker bed is transformed into a rowboat:
</P>
<P>
Awash and away,
</P>
<P>
I drift through the night,
</P>
<P>
Through mizzle and moonlight,
</P>
<P>
Through darkness, through light.
</P>
<P>
Eventually he drifts back to the seaside home of his human family,
where a little boy has been waiting for him to wake up.
</P>
<P>
There's nothing like cuddling up with your kid to read a slow,
sleepy story, and then waking up three hours later cramped in the
corner of her twin bed, a book on your nose and a crick in your neck.
</P>
<P>
Kids who live for those nights when they outlast their parents will
enjoy ``A Quiet Night In,'' by Jill Murphy (Candlewick Press, $12.95,
32 pages, ages 3 and up). The Larges -- a family of elephants that
debuted in Murphy's ``Five Minutes' Peace'' -- are celebrating Mr.
Large's birthday.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Large gets all the children ready for bed early so she and Mr.
Large can enjoy a quiet dinner by candlelight. But before they retire,
the kids talk Dad into reading them a story.
</P>
<P>
He conks out, and they persuade Mom to finish the book. She's
snoring a few pages later, and the kids are quite happy to tuck her in
next to Dad on the couch. After all, Mom and Dad did want a quiet
night in.

 ``Nuremberg: Infamy on Trial,'' by Joseph E. Persico 
 (Viking, $25.95, 520 pp.) 
 Heilbrunn is university fellow at the Center for German 
 and European Studies at Georgetown University. 
 Reviewed by Jacob Heilbrunn 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Considering that the United Nations has recently created a Bosnian
war-crimes tribunal, Joseph Persico's ``Nuremberg'' could hardly have
arrived at a more opportune moment.
</P>
<P>
Persico, who is the author of a fine biography of William Casey,
displays sleuthing skills worthy of the former CIA director in tracing
the course of the trial that sought to establish a basis for
prosecuting international atrocities. This is no dry-as-dust account,
but a vivid reconstruction of the actions of the wartime Allies and
the Nazi elite at Nuremberg. Using the private papers of the Nuremberg
prison psychiatrist, the letters and journals of prisoners, and
accounts of the battles between the prosecutors and judges, Persico
easily carries us into a deeper understanding of the trials.
</P>
<P>
Persico's book does suggest that justice at Nuremberg will remain a
noble idea murdered by a gang of ugly facts. The United States
designed the trials in the heady days after World War II. Nuremberg
was to signal not only the triumph of superior might, but also the
victory of superior morality. Like the United Nations and the World
Bank, the Nuremberg trials were an integral part of the postwar new
world order that the wise men of the American establishment attempted
to create after 1945. Today the Un ited States lacks the confidence
and the United Nations the power to realize that dream. The menace of
a loaded gun remains more potent than a diplomatic brief.
</P>
<P>
Still, the great merit of Persico's book is to remind us that the
undertaking itself was a success. Nuremberg's most significant
accomplishment was to confront the German people with crimes planned
and perpetrated by the Nazis. Unlike World War I, the Germans could
not seek refuge in the myth of a stab in the back. The trials showed
that they had stabbed themselves in the back.
</P>
<P>
Some of the most fascinating passages in Persico's book center on
the responses of the Nazi ringleaders to the overwhelming evidence of
concentration camps and mass shootings introduced at the trials. One
of the most odious cases was that of the former Nazi governor-general
of Poland, Hans Frank. In order to overcompensate for his partly
Jewish ancestry, Frank became one of the most fervent anti-Semites
among the Nazis. So determined was Frank to prove his loyalty to
Nazism that he had all of his rema rks condemning the Jews, and
boasting of exploiting 1.3 million Poles for forced labor, recorded
for posterity. Frank's voluminous records would form one of the key
sources for the Nuremberg prosecutors. At the trials, Frank veered
between acknowledging and repudiating guilt for his crimes.
</P>
<P>
Hermann Goering, by contrast, mustered up his old bravado. Goering,
whose outsized personality made him a favorite with the American GIs,
managed to bully most of his fellow defendants into refusing to plead
guilty. Indeed, Persico shows that under cross-examination the cunning
Goering even got the upper hand over his famous American prosecutor,
Robert Jackson. Goering managed to cheat the hangman as well. Persico,
who seeks to clear up the mystery surrounding Goering's suicide,
argues that upon enter ing prison Goering secreted a cyanide capsule
in his luggage and persuaded a member of the prison staff to take
pieces of luggage from the baggage room for him.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most sinister figure at the trial was the cultivated
technocrat Albert Speer, one of the few in the dock who received a
jail term rather than a death sentence. Though Speer used millions of
foreign workers as slave labor, he managed to shift responsibility
onto his boorish subordinate Fritz Sauckel. By taking the blame for
Nazism in the broadest sense but avoiding any particulars, Speer
managed to tell the judges what they wanted to be told. Speer
portrayed the Nazis as embodying the dange rs of a military technology
that would pose even greater dangers to humanity in the future. As
Persico puts it, Speer presented himself to the court ``not as a man
pleading for his life, but as one who had something valuable to tell
them, someone with a vision born of redemption after immersion in
evil.''
</P>
<P>
Indeed, as Speer had correctly calculated, his contrition
contrasted starkly with the stonewalling of his colleagues. In the
teeth of the evidence, Generals Jodl and Keitel denied culpability for
the atrocities on the Eastern front. The foppish foreign minister
Joachim Ribbentrop claimed that Germany had merely emulated America's
occupation of the New World.
</P>
<P>
Persico, who illuminates the pitiful character of most of the Nazi
leadership, does not draw the obvious conclusion that there was
nothing particularly exceptional about the character of most of
Hitler's henchmen. Ordinary men committed extraordinary crimes. In
that sense, the spirit of Nuremberg lives on in Bosnia.

 ``Lords of the Realm: The Real History of Baseball,'' by John 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Helyar (Villard, $24; 576 pages). 
 Hyman is a sports reporter for the Baltimore Sun 
 Reviewed by Mark Hyman 
 (c) 1994, The Baltimore Sun 
</P>
<P>
If John Helyar winds up on the best seller list with ``Lords of the
Realm: The Real History of Baseball,'' it will be for the anecdotes.
</P>
<P>
Exhibit A: As an infant players union is taking shape in 1967, its
new leader, Marvin Miller, calls a meeting and instructs players to
write down their most serious grievances with the owners. Pitcher Milt
Pappas, a former Baltimore Oriole, spoke for his colleagues firmly in
the grip of the mod generation. ``There aren't enough outlets for hair
dryers in the clubhouses,'' he thundered.
</P>
<P>
Exhibit B: William D. Eckert, retired one-star general, briefly
baseball commissioner in the late 1960s and early '70s, had a
remarkable penchant for confusing people and events. A notoriously
passionless public speaker, Eckert once began delivering remarks to an
audience of baseball officials before realizing the speech was
intended for the Retired Airline Pilots Association.
</P>
<P>
Exhibit C: Charles O. Finley ran a cut-rate front office in his
final years of owning the Oakland A's. By 1978, the entire operation
was down to six people, including a 16-year-old office assistant named
Stanley Burrell. Burrell has since changed his name -- to MC Hammer,
the rap star, now called just plain Hammer.
</P>
<P>
Helyar's book is rich with such stories. But it's clearly more than
a collection of quotable quotes and front-office trivia.
</P>
<P>
Instead, what Helyar offers is surely one of the most complete and
provocative histories ever written of major-league baseball -- as it
has played out in owners' suites and across the collective bargaining
table. It's a tad intimidating at 576 pages, but considering he begins
with Elysian Fields in the 1840s, and carries the story through the
sale of the Orioles last fall to Peter G. Angelos, the book is
anything but long-winded.
</P>
<P>
A word about Helyar: He may not be as familiar to readers of sports
books as Pete Golenbock or John Feinstein, who between them have
covered every topic but the secret world of stadium ushers. But
Helyar's credentials are substantial. His ``Barbarians at the Gate''
was a big best seller. He has built a reputation as a solid reporter
covering sports business issues for The Wall Street Journal .
</P>
<P>
In this book, Helyar tells his story, in part, as he profiles some
of baseball's most influential and, when the author is through, least
likable characters. In the process, more than a few myths are
exploded.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
For instance, he sheds a different sort of light on Kenesaw
Mountain Landis, the iron-willed judge credited with bringing baseball
back from the brink after the 1919 Black Sox scandal. Helyar has
discovered more: ``Under Landis, the morals of baseball were purified
 -- and the business of baseball was ossified.''
</P>
<P>
Landis, he writes, was among the least progressive men of his day.
He said no to lights at Crosley Field in Cincinnati, vowing there
would be no night baseball in the big leagues in his lifetime. He said
no to a beer company that wanted to buy advertising on World Series
radio broadcasts. If it was new, Landis said no.
</P>
<P>
Other notables appear equally as unsympathetic in Helyar's
narrative. The list is lengthy, and includes former baseball
commissioners Peter Ueberroth and Bowie Kuhn and former owners led by
the pre-eminent owner of his generation, Walter O'Malley of the
Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers. The miracle of Ueberroth is that he
lasted as long in the job as he did, given he barely could hide his
contempt for the owners.
</P>
<P>
``He treated them like retarded children,'' says a lawyer, unnamed,
quoted by Helyar.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
If there is a hero in the story, it is Miller, the man who brought
the players union into the 20th century, who stared down the owners,
broke the reserve clause and paved the way for today's million-dollar
salaries. Predictably, the owners despised him and, in Helyar's
telling, spent years calling him a collection of names, not all fit
for this newspaper.
</P>
<P>
This book is not always satisfying. For all its thoroughness, it
uncovers few important news stories.
</P>
<P>
There's also the issue of sourcing. Helyar writes in a seamless,
tightly organized style more like a technothriller than a nonfiction
baseball book.
</P>
<P>
In the preface Helyar provides a list of baseball folk who
cooperated with his reporting. What's missing is something more
substantial that connects facts to the sources from which the author
pulled them. As a newspaper guy, he should see the value in that.

 Travel Consultants: Don't Call Them Agents 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The travel agent is as close as most tourists ever get to a free
lunch. At no cost to you, an agent can recommend and book your
vacation, often drawing on special expertise and firsthand travel
experience in making recommendations. Find a good one and your life is
simplified.
</P>
<P>
But no lunch is truly free. The problem with many of the roughly
32,000 travel agencies in the United States is that agents' attentions
are claimed by computerized reservation systems, airline fare wars,
and fluctuations in the commissions they are paid by lodgings and
airlines. That often leaves agents without time to learn geography in
detail or see many destinations themselves.
</P>
<P>
Sensing an opening there, a new breed of travel consultants has
developed. They specialize in a certain area and reject the title
``travel agent'' as an understatement of their expertise. Some make
bookings, some don't. Some accept commissions, some don't. Most
interview customers about their preferences and interests, then come
back with itinerary proposals that touch on lodgings, dining, cultural
attractions and entertainment. Unlike travel agents, these consultants
charge consumers upfront for their service.
</P>
<P>
Their prices can be daunting -- as much as $70 an hour -- but they
can deliver a service highly prized by travelers with less time than
money. Regional expertise is one advantage. Also, for those
consultants who reject commissions -- taking their fees only from the
client -- their advice may be less influenced by monetary
considerations, and more likely to be ``pure.''
</P>
<P>
Here are a handful of such companies, listed by their territories:
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
-- California. Perfect Weekends (2059 Camden Ave., Suite 186, San
Jose, Calif. 95124; tel. 800-493-3536 or 408-559-3652). Susan Barton
</P>
<P>
opened San Jose-based Perfect Weekends in June, 1993, aiming to
match busy travelers with B Bs around the state. In the 11 months
since, she says, she has booked more than 400 trips.
</P>
<P>
Barton charges $99 to plan a one-destination trip, and presumes
that most of her customers will be driving. She books lodgings, makes
meal reservations, schedules lessons or rentals and often builds
weekends around special events.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
-- American West. Off the Beaten Path (109 E. Main St., Bozeman,
Mont. 59715; tel. 406-586-1311, fax 406-587-4147). Pam and Bill Bryan,
both trained environmentalists and tour guides, started the firm in
1987, specializing in outdoorsy trips to Arizona, New Mexico, Utah,
Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Montana and the Canadian provinces of
British Columbia and Alberta.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, Bill Bryan estimates, the company arranged trips for about
570 individuals, couples and groups, with activities such as fishing,
skiing, riding, hiking and canoeing. Fees for planning generally run
$70 an hour, with a minimum of four or eight hours, depending on the
complexity of the trip. Customers get detailed itineraries, plane
tickets and maps.
</P>
<P>
-- England. Oh to Be in England ... (2 Charlton St., New York, N.Y.
10014; tel. 212- 255-8739, fax 212-986-8365). Jennifer Dorn, an
administrator at New York University's law school and frequent
traveler to England,
</P>
<P>
set up her business four years ago. She doesn't make bookings (she
advises travelers to make reservations themselves or use a travel
agent), but fills spiral-bound notebooks with itinerary
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
A typical trip takes her about 10 hours to plan. In the last year,
she estimates that she haa done about 150 itineraries for $150-$225,
depending on the number of cities in the itinerary.
</P>
<P>
-- France. Point of View. (5922 Melvin Ave., Tarzana, Calif. 91356;
tel. 818-705-4418, fax 818-708-7131). Kajsa Agostini was born in
France and spent 15 years with the French Government Tourist Office in
California before striking off on her own last year.
</P>
<P>
Agostini
</P>
<P>
does not make bookings, but interviews travelers and devises an
itinerary. Once the itinerary is booked, Agostini often writes to
hotels to confirm reservations and ensure personalized service. She
charges about $200.
</P>
<P>

started her consulting business in 1988 after spending four years
leading walking tours through the country. Shaw maintains an office in
Rome. Her databank of Italian intelligence includes roughly 400 small
hotels throughout the country. She makes hotel and transportation
bookings and gives clients a portfolio that runs as long as 85 pages.
</P>
<P>
Her typical fee for a couple on a two-week trip with four stops:
$495. (If Shaw doesn't answer her phone, she's on a fact-finding trip;

 Pennsylvania's Lancaster County Serves Up a Memorable Vacation 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I first got off the Pennsylvania Turnpike at Morgantown, I
barely glanced at the horse and buggy two-stepping along ahead of me
in morning traffic. How nice, I thought -- carriage rides for tourists.
</P>
<P>
But then I started spotting buggies hitched outside pharmacies,
hardware stores and other everyday businesses on two-lane Route 23.
They really were a normal means of transportation in these parts.
</P>
<P>
There are tourist rides, too, all right. And loads of
pseudo-Pennsylvania Dutch attractions throughout rural Lancaster
County. But beyond the ``Amishland'' commercialism, a sizable
community of Plain People remarkably still flourishes much as it has
for 300 years -- largely without benefit of automobiles, electricity
and other trappings of modern life.
</P>
<P>
By avoiding the main routes -- especially kitschy U.S. 30 -- visitors
can glimpse the old-fashioned lifestyle of the Amish without feeling
like intruders.
</P>
<P>
Meander along the byways and you'll crisscross fields that inspire
the designs of exquisite patchwork quilts and see farmers walking
behind plows pulled by mules. Women in bonnets tend their kitchen
gardens and children with Dutch cuts skip-ride home from school on
old-fashioned wooden scooters. Small home-based shops display
first-rate yet inexpensive local crafts, and roadside stands sell
garden-fresh produce and mouth-watering baked goods.
</P>
<P>
Lancaster might well be the Comfort Food Capital of the universe,
embodying the familiar aura one restaurant localizes as ``Mom and
shoo-fly pie.'' Countless places feature inexpensive food that
invigorates the term home cooking. Virtually everything is made from
scratch: crispy potato chips, crusty rolls, tangy condiments and
flaky, gooey desserts. Some of these family-oriented restaurants
(which seldom serve alcohol) also specialize in all-you-can eat
smorgasbords, although allowances are made for tiny appetites. One
place, for example, prices meals for kids by their weight: five cents
per pound. The annual Pennsylvania Dutch Food Festival, set to take
place at many sites around the county June 13 to 18, will provide a
ready-made vacation focus.
</P>
<P>
My first stop on my recent tour was the Pennsylvania Dutch Visitors
Center, which offers a great map, piles of brochures and a 15-minute
introductory film on the area. I learned that the Amish (pronounced
AH-mish, after founder Jakob Ammann) are descendants of
German-speaking Anabaptists, who believe the decision to be baptized
should be made as an adult. The Amish broke off from the more liberal
Mennonites three centuries ago, fled persecution in Europe and found
peace in William Penn's new colony and various other communities in
North America. Both sects -- and a third Anabaptist group called the
Brethren -- today live amicably in Lancaster County despite wide
variations in customs.
</P>
<P>
The dark clothing and simple lifestyle that distinguish the Old
Order Amish symbolizes their commitment to their faith. They also take
to heart the biblical edict against graven images, which tourists are
asked to respect by not photographing them.
</P>
<P>
Old Order Amish mingle with outsiders (whom they generically refer
to as ``English''), and a few even invite visitors to join family
dinners in their homes. They rarely cater to overnight guests.
Tourists can, however, sample rural life firsthand on numerous
Mennonite farms within a 10- or 15-mile radius of downtown Lancaster.
Some of these bed and breakfast accommodations are rather spartan, but
others, like Barbara and Harold Frey's Morning Meadows Farm in
Marietta, offer all the comforts of a country guest house along with a
chance to experience the daily farm routine (which, be warned, can
start at dawn).
</P>
<P>
My second-floor room at Morning Meadows Farm was prettily decorated
in Victorian-country style and had a modern private bath and a small
TV. Adjoining it was a cozy sitting room with magazines and another TV
and outside was a wide porch offering panoramic views of fields and
barns.
</P>
<P>
I asked for a restaurant suggestion and Frey recommended the
Country Table Restaurant in nearby Mount Joy. It was a family place,
overlooking nothing but a packed parking lot, but it served one of the
best restaurant meals I've ever eaten: juicy pork chops, crisp salad,
fresh vegetables, oven-baked potato and rolls, herb tea and a wedge of
that molassesy Pennsylvania Dutch favorite, shoo-fly pie. Cost: $9.49.
</P>
<P>
This is an early-to-bed, early-to-rise culture and most restaurants
close by 8 or 9 p.m. Breakfast at Morning Meadows was at 8 a.m., and
consisted of an apple dumpling hot from the oven and French toast with
bacon -- all delicious. While I lingered over my juice and coffee, the
Freys chatted about the area and suggested sightseeing possibilities.
</P>
<P>
Various auto-tape tours of the area are available at Lancaster's
Mennonite Information Center, but I preferred to take advantage of the
center's personal guide service ($6 paid to the center, then a fee of
$8.50 an hour to the guide who rides in your car).
</P>
<P>
For the next two hours (the minimum tour time), a Mennonite woman
named Alverna Hess directed me along 20 or 30 miles of back roads,
pointing out covered bridges, cemeteries and Amish traditions.
</P>
<P>
Windmills whirred in many farmyards, and black dresses and shirts
fluttered from clotheslines -- a sure sign, she said, of an Amish
household, which has diesel-powered milking machines and propane-fired
hot-water heaters to meet government health requirements but few other
modern appliances. The occasional roadside phone booths we saw aren't
public ones, Hess explained; they belong to the nearest house -- 
another concession to the realities of doing business in the 20th
century but kept at a discreet distance.
</P>
<P>
After I dropped off my guide, I continued a few miles south of
Lancaster to Strasburg, a pretty village with several attractions for
train buffs -- including the nation's oldest short-line railroad.
</P>
<P>
Next I headed northwest to equally charming Lititz, which offers
some of the best shopping in Lancaster County. The aromas alone led me
to two must-stops: the Sturgis Pretzel Bakery and the Wilbur Chocolate
Factory. At both you can watch the cooks in action and stock up on
their products.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
My second night was at one of the Inns at Doneckers, a collection
of four restored houses, one the site of the first Donecker family
business back in 1910. I stayed in The Guesthouse, which has 20
distinctive rooms and suites. My room, one of the least expensive, was
nevertheless the epitome of country style. Some walls were
hand-stencilled, others exposed brick. Two handsome hooked rugs served
as wall art.
</P>
<P>
After breakfast, I strolled down the road to Doneckers Artworks, a
four-story marketplace of artists' studios and galleries with an
adjoining farmers' market. The market was stuffed with fresh produce
and smelled of spring flowers, apple pie and Auntie Anne's
scrumptious, hand-rolled soft pretzels, so I was surprised at how few
customers were there.
</P>
<P>
The answer was clear as soon as I turned my car onto North State
Street to head for the nearby competition. Traffic crawled most of the
way to the Green Dragon market, one of the biggest in the county
(along with Lancaster's Central Market and Root's Market near
Manheim). The Dragon was the quintessential country flea market -- an
indoor/outdoor bazaar featuring everything from produce to clothing
with, of course, the requisite supply of goodies -- down to homemade
root beer.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Between markets, wineries, breweries, potteries, antiques markets
and various fairs and festivals, there's no end of country diversions
around Lancaster (note that some attractions are closed on Sundays).
There's also interesting walking in downtown Lancaster, which was
Pennsylvania's capital for 11 years and which served as the nation's
capital for one day -- Sept. 27, 1777 -- when Congress stopped there
after fleeing from Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
My most indelible memory of the area, however, remains the
home-cooked meals turned out by seemingly every kitchen. I wonder if
any of them delivers.

 EDER ON BOOKS: The Root of Rootlessness 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The word ``Caribbean'' may conjure up all kinds of vivid colors,
but to V.S. Naipaul it suggests gray: a land and seascape bleached out
by unmediated sun and a counterfeit history. It is the gray in the
face of a professional entertainer the morning after a late night.
</P>
<P>
The displacing and alienating effects of a colonial past on today's
post-colonial peoples has been Naipaul's leading theme ever since,
once past his early Trinidad novels, he broke through the colors to
the gray underneath. He has pursued it in his fiction and non-fiction,
set in Britain, Africa, South America and India, the home of his
forebears.
</P>
<P>
He is one of literature's great travelers and also one of its
oddest. He seeks not roots but rootlessness. He travels not for
acquaintance but for alienation. Paul Theroux does that, to an extent,
but the difference is very large. For one thing, Naipaul, who can be
petty, vain and cruel, both uses and transcends his defects. His theme
is the terrible inauthenticity that history has imposed on the heirs
of colonialism's subjects. But by refusing to conceal or temper his
own crabby vision -- a walleyed sensibility that tends to swivel inward
 -- he achieves at his best moments a unique authenticity.
</P>
<P>
His nightmare Argentina, for example, can be unrecognizable but
there is no question about the nightmares that it produces in Naipaul.
When he is not displaying a certain haste and roughness (on purpose,
perhaps, like a musician asserting his freedom to play sour), he is a
great writer. In a magical and redeeming phrase he will suddenly link
up the particular estrangements he acquires, wherever he goes, to the
estranged wanderer in all of us.
</P>
<P>
``A Way in the World'' (Alfred A. Knopf, $23, 380 pp.) is a series
of partly autobiographical and partly fictional variations on his
theme. Each centers on a different personage, and Naipaul himself
appears in many of them. The principal characters differ widely. There
is a Trinidadian who uses his color sense as both a funeral parlor
cosmetician and a cake decorator; and a conservative Port of Spain
lawyer who unexpectedly reveals his flaming commitment to black power.
There is a supercilious English writer who helps and patronizes the
narrator; an itinerant Caribbean radical -- ``an impresario of
revolution'' -- who is lionized by the radically chic in London and New
York, and an enterprising Venezuelan who has submerged his identity as
a Trinidadian Hindu.
</P>
<P>
Some of the figures are historical. Naipaul writes a vivid
fictionalized account of Sir Walter Raleigh, aged and desperate,
seeking to discover El Dorado as a way out of his political troubles
at home. He paints a poignantly imagined portrait of the early
Venezuelan revolutionary, Francisco de Miranda, lifted up and let down
by his British patrons and finally, betrayed by the supporters of
Bolivar, dying in a Spanish prison.
</P>
<P>
At first glance there seems to be little connection among the real,
part-real and fictional characters he writes of. The styles differ
considerably too: from factual documentary to a first-person
combination of memoir and commentary to poetic evocation. In fact all
of the protagonists are linked by their passage through the world of
the Caribbean. It is a world that, instead of evolving gradually
through slow migrations and evolution, was created in a kind of
cataclysm.
</P>
<P>
In the space of a few years, the Spanish, the French and the
British landed, fought each other, and shoved aside the Native
Americans as unfit for their purpose. Their purpose was sugar
plantations; and to accomplish it they brought over slaves from Africa
and indentured laborers from India. And then, after a couple of
centuries, they were gone; leaving behind a fragmented culture resting
on a jumbled, conflicting, half-dreamed past. Naipaul doesn't draw the
comparison, but one thinks of Prince Sigismund in Calderon's ``Life Is
a Dream.'' Arbitrarily immured in a tower from infancy, he suddenly
finds himself -- arbitrarily released and royal once more -- in a wide
and terrifying universe.
</P>
<P>
Sigismund went temporarily mad. Naipaul's characters are put
together out of pieces that don't fit. Though not usually mad, they
maneuver hybrid and uncertain identities through a world constructed
of misapprehensions and are visited by undissolved bits of a heritage
they are unconscious of.
</P>
<P>
In his gentle corpse-and-cake decorator, Naipaul sees an ancestral
ghost of ``the dancing groups of Lucknow, lewd men who painted their
faces and tried to live like women.'' He adds: ``He frightened me
because I felt his feeling for beauty was like an illness; as though
some unfamiliar deforming virus had passed through his simple mother
to him and was even then ... something neither of them had begun to
understand.'' The lawyer, Evander, a properly British-mannered black
professional in a still-colonial Trinidad, receives a courtesy visit
from young Naipaul, about to depart for London on a prized
scholarship. There is a starchy moment or two; then, startlingly,
Evander raises his fist, smiles, and says: ``The race! The race,
man!''
</P>
<P>
It was meant as a secret, confraternal sign to a youth who was off
to learn from the enemy and come back to fight. Except that Naipaul
wasn't. He was off to gather the rewards that the British colonial
authorities had implied would be his when he reached London with his
prize. Instead there were years of misery, condescension and the
grinding struggle to find himself as a writer. In his portrait of
Foster Morris, an established author who helps him generously and then
mortally offends him, Naipaul vents with gleeful malice his feelings
toward the grip of British attitudes, not only on his country but also
on his own divided nature.
</P>
<P>
But Evander mistook young Naipaul in another respect, as well. As a
member of Trinidad's Indian minority, he felt no kinship with the
black nationalist current that was to accompany independence in
Trinidad and other parts of the Caribbean. On the contrary, he felt
his own identity threatened; as he would years later in Africa, where
the Indian middle class was a particular target of black politics.
</P>
<P>
Naipaul's angers can be useful as well as shrill, and usually
directed at those -- British and black -- who exercise power. The finest
portraits are of figures torn and fluttering through their lives and
identities. His Miranda is one of the best things he has done, and he
writes of the deluded Raleigh with unusual compassion. And there is
the Indian whom Raleigh, assuming he comes from El Dorado, takes back
to London to make up for the gold he couldn't find. In fact, Don Jose
comes from the well-settled province of Nueva Granada (Colombia). His
reflections on Raleigh and on European dreams have a haunting
simplicity. Asked years later what difference he finds between the
Europeans and the Indians, he answers with an irony that points up
what Naipaul is after:
</P>
<P>
``I've thought a lot about that. And I think, Father, that the
difference between us, who are Indians, or half Indians, and people
like the Spaniards and the English and the Dutch and the French,
people who know how to go where they are going, I think that for them
the world is a safer place.''

</P>
<P>
The series, beginning Friday night, is about the way transportation
shapes our national character and our landscape. It mixes history,
philosophy, facts and personal stories as it talks about railroads,
container ships, airplanes, truckers hauling down the highways; about
building interstates and suburbs and light rail systems; and about
shipping to people in all areas what they want and need all year
around.

<P>
It was living in Los Angeles that caused Perry to realize that
transportation ``becomes a dominant feature of your life. I was living
the problem. I thought, `As a television producer, there is something
I can do about this.' It's been a six-year journey from the time the
idea occurred until now, and I've learned a lot. In the beginning, I
went to find out who was doing this to us, and I realized that it
wasn't anybody: We had met the enemy and he was us.''

 After Honeymoon, Mandela Faces Deadly Dilemmas of South 
 Africa's Arms Industry 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The little-noticed role of South African-made arms in the
catastrophe of Rwanda presents Nelson Mandela with an early test of
his ability to reconcile realism and idealism.
</P>
<P>
At least 3,000 of Rwanda's soldiers and militiamen carry South
African-made R-4 automatic rifles. Rwanda bought them in 1992 from
Armscor -- South Africa's state-owned arms corporation -- along with
10,000 hand grenades, 20,000 rifle grenades, 10,000 launching grenades
and more than 1 million rounds of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
In Rwanda's killing fields, such grenades and automatic rifles have
been weapons of choice, after machetes.
</P>
<P>
At the Christ Spirituality Center in Kigali, soldiers opened fire
with automatic rifles, killing five diocesan priests, nine congregated
women, three Jesuits and their cook. In Rukara, journalists came upon
about 500 corpses inside a church. One survivor said the people had
died when militiamen threw dozens of grenades inside the building.
</P>
<P>
Will the new South Africa sell arms to countries like Rwanda?
Mandela, with his international reputation as a peace-aker, may not
want to. But the United Nations trade embargo against South Africa is
expected to be lifted soon,and new markets are already opening up for
South Africa's deadliest goods.
</P>
<P>
Andre Buys, an executive for Armscor, told Defense News last month
that ``we expect that by 1996 (arms) exports will at least double, and
possibly quadruple.''
</P>
<P>
Like Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia before him, Mandela may find
that his humanitarian impulses are not strong enough to resist the
financial attractions of the arms trade.
</P>
<P>
When Havel became president of Czechoslovakia in 1989, he promised
to end arms exports. But last year, after the country split into the
Czech Republic and Slovakia, both renewed sales.
</P>
<P>
Before Mandela's inauguration, ANC spokesman Madala Mthembu
carefully suggested that the post-apartheid government would not
abstain from the arms business.
</P>
<P>
``Once the new government is up and running, we will welcome a
complete lifting of all remaining sanctions and embargoes against
South Africa,'' Mthembu told Defense News. ``We also wish to state the
new government will be in full compliance with international standards
governing exports of technologies and materials that would threaten
world security.''
</P>
<P>
Such standards would preclude arms sales to states like Libya,
which is also currently subject to a U.N. embargo. But states like
Rwanda before its present crisis would still be able to legally buy
arms.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic strife, which plagues much of the world, makes for a boom
market in the weapons trade. And South African weapons are generally
more reliable, accurate and durable than comparable arms made by
Egypt, Russia, Romania and even Israel in some categories.
</P>
<P>
While the world rejoices in witnessing apartheid's downfall, it
will have the unexpected effect of adding to the glut of arms already
flooding the places that least need them, such as Rwanda, Sudan and
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
No one expects Mandela to turn his back on what promises to become
one of the new South Africa's better earners of foreign exchange. But
few would expect, either, a man who has devoted his life to his
country's struggle for justice, equality and human rights to turn his
back on future victims of other abusive regimes. He doesn't
necessarily have to.
</P>
<P>
South Africa can afford to forgo sales of guns and grenades because
it actually makes most of its profits from the sale of expensive,
high-technology systems like laser-designated missiles, aircraft
electronic warfare systems, tactical radios, anti-radiation bombs and
battlefield mobility systems. This sort of weaponry, while potentially
deadly, is much less likely to be used in human-rights abuses than
small arms.
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of an end to the U.N. embargo, South Africa created
the Denel Corp. in 1992. While Armscor has since served as the
government's defense-procurement organization, Denel has operated as a
private manufacturing consortium, representing 60 percent of the arms
industry.
</P>
<P>
Denel expects to lead export sales; such sales averaged $127.5
million in the early 1990s and increased to $222.2 million in 1993.
Rwanda's purchase of $5.9 million of grenades, mortars and ammunition
from Denel made only a tiny addition to South Africa's balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
South Africa also has a technological edge in land-mine-detection
and -sweeping equipment especially needed by Cambodia and other
countries. While South Africa has already begun to market this
equipment, it announced in March that it would not sell land mines at
the same time and stopped exports. Although it could be argued that
this announcement was motivated more by appearance than principle, it
was a welcome sign.

But Mandela and the ANC's stated policy isn't good enough.
Exporting mine-sweeping equipment is a legitimate way to earn foreign
exchange; sales of any arms to human-rights violators are not.
</P>
<P>
The new South Africa should re-examine its export policy on such
items. International prohibitions against arms sales to abusive
regimes are at present non-existent or weak.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda, with its long-documented history of ethnic strife and its
grisly record of human-rights abuses, is a case in point. Rather than
sink to this standard, Mandela should lead the world in raising it up.

 ``A Whole New Life: An Illness and a Healing,'' by Reynolds Price 
 (Atheneum, $20, 213 pp.) 
 Selzer is a surgeon and the author of ``Down From Troy'' and 
 ``Raising the Dead.'' 
 Reviewed by Richard Selzer 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is only natural that a writer make the literary most of whatever
happens to him.
</P>
<P>
In April 1984 the distinguished novelist Reynolds Price was asked
by a friend with whom he was walking why he kept slapping his foot on
the pavement. It was the first faint whisper of the monstrous illness
that would roar across his body for the next four years. For
unbeknown, an eel-shaped tubular cancer had taken root and was
compressing his spinal cord.
</P>
<P>
For the next four years the author would undergo radiation to his
spinal cord, multiple surgical procedures -- diagnostic, palliative and
the last, one hopes, curative. In addition to the paralysis of the
lower half of the body, there was a slowly ascending numbness to just
below the nipple line. And there was pain, real and phantom, the
latter no less severe for all its suggestion of unreality. It was
suffering worthy of Job. On page after page, we are confronted by the
downright ugliness of suffering, its senselessness. Pain is not noble;
it is disgustingly ordinary.
</P>
<P>
The reader tries to imagine the pain, but the language of pain is
exclusive; it is a tongue spoken by one person only. The rest of us
are not conversant in it, nor can it be conveyed in words. Never mind,
we shall know it in our turn. There is some danger in the reiteration
of pain, that it will eventually have an anesthetic effect no matter
how persuasive the writing. In this, it is not unlike pornography that
within minutes becomes tedious. The rapture of others cannot be
rendered in words either; for that too we must wait our turn.
</P>
<P>
``A Whole New Life'' is Price's candid account of his ordeal,
written, he announces, to furnish others in similar trouble ``a
companionable voice that's lasted beyond all rational expectation.''
He has written it years after the white heat of the events and from
the vantage of the crippled survivor. Like many such recountings, I
suspect it was written also to exteriorize the horror, to put a
barrier of printed pages between himself and what can best be
described as a re-enactment of Dante's ``Inferno.'' Eschewing the
novelist's proven gifts of style -- there is none of the elegance,
nuance, ambiguity or wit of his powerful novel, ``Kate Vaiden'' -- he
tells his story in a prose that is stripped down and pell-mell,
utterly devoid of the pomp of language or the writer's vanity. The
sentences come spilling out much as the facts were remembered, but the
meaning of the sometimes clotted paragraphs is never in doubt.
</P>
<P>
Much of the book tells of the few ups and the many downs in his
agonizing struggle to live -- the progressive loss of strength and
sensation and function. With each diminution, along with the author,
we contemplate sadly the little that remains from the much that was. A
good deal of the account is moving: his brother's preoperative kiss,
and the fellowship of the ``gimps'' at the the rehabilitation center
all striving to recover a modicum of independence. We cheer each brief
respite from pain as we do his brave resumption of writing and
teaching.
</P>
<P>
What sustained him? There was a seemingly endless line of kind
friends and acquaintances who committed themselves over long periods
of time to assist Price in recapturing the pace of his life. One's
inner strength is no match for suffering. It is not our own strength
alone that will help us prevail, but the strength and commiseration of
others. It takes courage to lean on others, but great suffering
demands of us that humility.
</P>
<P>
Too, there is Price's lifelong belief in a God who is personally
interested in him, if not always benevolent. This belief was made
powerfully manifest just prior to the course of irradiation. The area
on his back to be treated had already been marked out with purple dye.
The radiation oncologist had informed the patient of all the
possibilities. Shortly thereafter, Reynolds Price experienced an
uncanny translocation in which he found himself lying on a slope by
the Sea of Galilee in 1st-Century Palestine. Sleeping nearby were
Christ and his 12 apostles all dressed in the tunics and cloaks of the
time. In the distance he saw the town of Capernaum just as it was.
Jesus looked much like the Flemish paintings of him, lean, ``tall with
dark hair, unblemished skin and a self-possession both natural and
imposing.'' He rose, directed Price to undress, then led the naked man
into the waters of Galilee. Now, existing both with and outside of his
body, the author could see the purple marks on his back. Again and
again Jesus poured handfuls of water over him. There was dialogue:
</P>
<P>
``Your sins are forgiven.''
</P>
<P>
``Am I also to be cured?''
</P>
<P>
``That too.''
</P>
<P>
From the moment Price's mind returned to the here and now, he has
believed this event to be neither dream nor vision but ``an external
gift ... of an alternate time and place in which to live through a
crucial act.'' For Price, this experience had a tactile reality. It
happened. Even the skeptical reader shivers in wild surmise.
</P>
<P>
The man who emerges from these pages is feisty, gritty, angry,
sometimes snobbish and, notwithstanding, most appealing. He makes no
effort to portray himself as a saint or a martyr. The clerk at the
hospital is ``sullen.'' The cardiac fitness participants are imagined
as ``a squad of garrulous heart-attack survivors in designer sweat
suits.'' Many of the ``true practical saints'' who offer to help him
are ``boring as root canals.'' It is the radiation oncologist, cast as
the villain, who bears the brunt of Price's anger and resentment. He
has ``all the visible concern of a steel cheese-grater''; he ``never
offered to tell me ...''; he is ``the frozen oncologist.''
</P>
<P>
And here another physician must demur. Was it not this very doctor,
among others, whose judgment and therapy brought about the cure of his
patient? Surely, that he is not also gifted with charm or bedside
manner might be forgiven? Some doctors, particularly those whose work
brings them daily into contact with the gravely ill and whose
treatments themselves augment the suffering, may function better when
they withhold or even stifle pity, compassion, aesthetic response than
when they allow these feelings full sway. Certainly there are great
doctors who are also haughty, cold, materialistic and insensitive;
just as there are great artists who fall short of expectations.
Beethoven, Wagner and Richard Strauss were bigoted, angry,
domineering. Schopenhauer and Rossini were scornful and misanthropic.
Da Vinci and Goethe were detached, aloof and condescending. And then
there was Robert Frost.
</P>
<P>
It is in the final section of the book that Price rises above the
dreadful years and reaches out to his new life. It is a life full of
satisfactions, work, friends and even erotic love. ``Reynolds Price,''
he told himself, ``is dead.'' And asked himself: ``Who can you be?''
The answer is: a writer and a teacher as before, only now with the
patience and watchfulness born of suffering, and the blessing of whole
days of focused energy undiluted by the distractions of the
able-bodied. In the years since his illness, Reynolds Price has
written 14 books. His last advice to the afflicted is to finish
grieving for the former self, to reach out hungrily to the new and to
find work that sustains the spirit. In writing ``A Whole New Life''
Reynolds Price has come, in the words of Adrienne Rich, ``to see the
damage that was done/and the treasures that prevail.'' There can be no
sweeter use made of adversity than this act of generosity that comes
in the form of a book.

 Welcome Breeze From the North 
 The following editorial appeared in Tuesday's Los Angeles Times: 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The crisis that has been rapidly building over North Korea's
suspected nuclear weapons program seems for now to have abated.
Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency have been sent
to Pyongyang to see what they can learn about the refueling of a key
reactor that is now under way. Washington, welcoming this and other
recent signs hinting at a more cooperative attitude by the North, says
that it's ready to reopen high-level contacts with Kim Il Sung's
regime.
</P>
<P>
So for the moment at least the United States doesn't have to worry
about trying to muster international support for economic sanctions
against a country that, at a minimum, seems to have done all it can to
encourage the belief that it has been violating the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty. How long that moment will last is up to
Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
The key question is whether North Korea will let IAEA inspectors
examine several hundred specifically chosen fuel rods from its
five-megawatt reactor at Yongbyon, north of Pyongyang. By analyzing
certain rods the IAEA could tell how long they had been in the
reactor, and that in turn would indicate whether other fuel rods had
earlier been secretly removed. There's a suspicion, heightened in the
last few days by the claims in Tokyo of a North Korean defector who
once worked at the Yongbyon reprocessing plant, that 26 pounds of
plutonium were secretly extracted from spent fuel rods in 1988. That
supports the CIA's suspicion that the North has produced enough
plutonium for a couple of nuclear devices.
</P>
<P>
The United States is ready -- it wouldn't be too much to say eager -- 
to move toward normal relations with North Korea and so help stabilize
Northeast Asia. Rightly, though, it conditions such a move on
Pyongyang's readiness to meet its responsibilities under the
Non-Proliferation Treaty. South Korea supports the American effort. If
North Korea goes along, it could see its diplomatic and economic
isolation end. If it balks, new pressures would fall on its weak
economy. Enlightened self-interest makes the choice clear. The
question is whether a regime that has for decades zealously preached
the virtues of inward-looking self-reliance is able finally to
recognize where its true long-term interests lie.

 Boxed in on Haiti 
 The following editorial appeared in Tuesday's Baltimore Sun: 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Step by step, President Clinton seems to be maneuvering himself
into a position on Haiti where his only option may be military
intervention. If that is the president's intention, it should be
reversed forthwith. He must know that two-thirds of the American
people oppose such a step; that with the first American casualties
there will be a clamor for withdrawal of U.S. forces; that the last
time Marines marched ashore in Haiti, in 1915, they were there 19
years, and after taking 126 combat and non-combat casualties left
behind a trained -- and oppressive -- military.
</P>
<P>
The ideal solution evidently sought by Clinton is sufficient
international pressure to force the Haitian generals now in control
into exile. There is a precedent: In 1986, the United States was able
to send dictator Jean Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier packing. But there
is another precedent: his father, Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier,
successfully defied a U.S. show of force in 1963.
</P>
<P>
By tightening the embargo on Haiti over last weekend, the world
community decided in effect to increase the suffering of the Haitian
people in order to liberate them. Food and medicine are the exception.
But as jobs and private-sector imports of vital commodities disappear,
aid organizations warn that hunger and death will increase.
</P>
<P>
Some of ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's more fervent
supporters, both foreign and domestic, are willing to have the poorest
people in the hemisphere's poorest country pay this price.
</P>
<P>
The situation could force President Clinton's hand. Having taken on
a certain responsibility for worsening the plight of the Haitian
people and having drawn only defiance from Haiti's military
government, he may find himself with little choice other than to order
the Marines ashore. Some 650 aboard the USS Wasp are moving into
position.
</P>
<P>
What then? Will U.S. citizens be taken hostage in a desperate
counter-move by the present government? Will Haitian forces crumble at
the first sight of the Marines, as their leaders flee to luxurious
exile? Will Father Aristide's revenge-minded followers then turn on
the soldiers that remain? Or will a form of civil war break out, part
ethnic and part class-based, that will make a mockery of
quick-solution scenarios? And even if U.S. forces stay the course,
under the facade of a multinational intervention, just what will their
mission be?
</P>
<P>
To feed the masses? That's the easy part, as humanitarian successes
in Somalia illustrate. To crack down on violence-minded factions?
That's a much tougher role, one the U.S. could not sustain in Somalia.
To rebuild the Haitian government and and economy? That's a task the
U.S. never really attempted in Somalia, that it flunked the last time
out in Haiti and that it is unlikely to assume again, given the budget
squeeze and public opinion.
</P>
<P>
So Clinton is boxed in by the Haiti crisis, and so is our country.
Any solution other than the quick capitulation of the present military
government offers little but pain and foreboding.

 ``Don't Look Back: Satchel Paige in the Shadows of Baseball,'' 
 by Mark Ribowsky (Simon Schuster, $23, 351 pp.) 
 Goldstein is a free-lance writer. 
 Reviewed by Patrick Goldstein 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It isn't easy for athletes to be legends anymore. Over-analyzed by
cranky sportswriters, noisily critiqued by moronic sports talk-radio
callers, their gravity-defying feats have been reduced to ESPN
highlight-reel fodder. Just ask Barry Bonds, whose most enduring media
moment remains his nasty on-the-field shouting match with then-manager
Jim Leyland. Sports legend derives from larger-than-life feats,
created away from the glare of the spotlight. It belongs to the oral
tradition, tales told and retold, till they take on an appropriately
mythic stature. Who knows if Babe Ruth really pointed to the
right-field bleachers and called his shot in the 1932 World Series?
Who actually saw Pete Gray, the St. Louis Browns' one-armed
outfielder, in action, throwing a runner out at home plate? How many
people got to watch Johnny Vander Meer pitch a no-hitter -- in two
consecutive games?
</P>
<P>
In baseball, the murkiest of all legends have sprung from the
mythic twilight of the Negro Leagues. Thrown together during the sorry
days of segregated sport, they showcased the young black gods of
baseball, performing in the same cities -- often in the same ballparks
 -- as major-league players, sometimes even wearing the big-leaguers'
discarded uniforms.
</P>
<P>
That's where you'd find Leroy ``Satchel'' Paige, barnstorming
across the country in wheezing buses, sleeping in fleabag hotels,
playing in ramshackle bandboxes across town from the storied
major-league ballparks. Of all the mythic stars of Negro baseball,
Satchel was mythic-squared. Unhittable in his prime, he once struck
out 22 men in a game, beat Bob Feller 1-0 in a 13-inning exhibition
game and was so indomitable he threw a no-hitter in the first game of
a double-header and then pitched relief in the nightcap.
</P>
<P>
After hitting .398 in the Pacific Coast League in 1935, Joe
DiMaggio prepared for his rookie season with the New York Yankees by
facing Paige in a much-ballyhooed exhibition game. The future Hall of
Famer managed a measly infield hit in four trips to the plate, moving
a Yankee scout to wire home: ``DiMaggio all we hoped he'd be: hit
Satch one for four.''
</P>
<P>
The legend simmered, soaking up its rich flavor in obscurity. As
far as the white press was concerned, Paige (who was as celebrated in
'30s-era black circles as Cab Calloway or Louis Armstrong) might as
well have been pitching in Outer Mongolia. When Time magazine finally
discovered Paige in 1940 -- 15 years into his career -- it offered some
legendry of its own.
</P>
<P>
Attributing Satchel's arm strength to his boyhood shouldering of
200-pound blocks of ice, the news magazine quoted Paige's old
ice-wagon employer as saying: ``That boy et mo' than the hosses.''
</P>
<P>
Until now, that's been the Satch story: Print the caricature. But
judging from ``Don't Look Back,'' Mark Ribowsky's meticulously
researched biography, there is another, considerably starker -- and
less sentimental -- side to Paige. Raised in the rough-and-tumble
ghetto area of Mobile, Ala., Paige was a restless, lonely man, a black
shadow in a white-only world, his soul shriveled by a lack of
acceptance, both from his family and the realm of big-time sport.
</P>
<P>
Before he was 20, Paige had hit the road, learning his pitching
craft on baseball's chitlins circuit. Though Ribowsky is more
successful at sketching the Negro League milieu than fleshing out
Paige's character, the scrawny, rawboned pitcher emerges as a man of
few loyalties, either to friend or team, indifferent to family ties,
easily seduced by a pretty woman or a fat paycheck.
</P>
<P>
Take away his wonderful wit and legendary showmanship and -- dare we
say it -- Satchel might be almost as hard to love as Barry Bonds.
Resolutely unfaithful to every woman in his life, Paige was jealous of
teammates' success, a hard-drinking carouser, habitually late to even
the most important games and disdainful of anything resembling a
training regime.
</P>
<P>
Paige was at least 42 (some say 44 or even 48) when Cleveland
Indians owner Bill Veeck finally brought him to the big leagues in
1948, a year after Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier. Making his
first appearance in relief on July 9, he was the man who brought black
vaudeville style to white sport, decades before the high five, the
monster jam and the end-zone dance.
</P>
<P>
Paige mystified batters with a carnival assortment of trick
pitches. Using a double or even triple windup with a huge leg kick,
he'd throw what he called a Step'n Pitch-it, a Bat Dodger and finally,
his mind-boggling Hesitation Pitch, where he held back his right arm
even as his front leg swept his body forward, releasing the ball
almost as an afterthought. The first major-leaguer who tried to hit
the Hesitation Pitch lunged and swung before the pitch was half-way to
the plate, his bat flying 40 feet up the third-base line. Satch was a
sensation. By the time he started his first major-league game on Aug.
3, 72,562 fans were at Cleveland's Municipal Stadium, a new attendance
record for a major-league night game.
</P>
<P>
Though well past his prime, Paige played parts of six seasons in
the majors and was good enough to be named to the 1952 All-Star team.
Never a friend to Robinson -- he had given him the cold shoulder in the
Negro Leagues -- he displayed little of Robinson's credit-to-his-race
good citizenry. Paige missed trains, broke curfew and carried around a
gun a foot and a half long.
</P>
<P>
His eccentricities won him huge play in the white press, which
viewed him as post-integration baseball's answer to Louie Armstrong -- 
Satchmo meet Satch -- a happy-go-lucky old coot who rubbed mystery
potions on his pitching arm, dozed in the bullpen grass and issued
such maxims as, ``If your stomach disputes you, lie down and pacify it
with cool thoughts'' and the immortal phrase (which Ribowsky borrows
for his book title), ``Don't look back. Something might be gaining on
you.''
</P>
<P>
These nostrums were strictly for media consumption. In real life,
the string-bean pitcher burned the candle at every end. As Ribowsky
recounts in vivid detail, Paige was far from the only model of
impropriety in the 1930s-era Negro Leagues. Many of the most prominent
teams were owned by gangsters such as Gasoline Gus Greenlee, who ran
the Pittsburgh Crawfords, using the team as a legit cover for his
numbers racket.
</P>
<P>
Paige was hardly intimidated by Greenlee's mob ties. When a
promoter offered him more money to barnstorm through the Dakotas,
Paige abruptly walked out on his new contract with the Crawfords.
</P>
<P>
Aloof and enigmatic all the way to his grave, Paige seems to have
defeated his biographer's best efforts to penetrate his inscrutable
mask. None of Paige's offspring would talk to Ribowsky, while the dim
memories of his ball-playing peers offer little in the way of insight.
</P>
<P>
Eager to provide Paige's exploits with some heft, Ribowsky
sometimes aims too high, using quotes from Henry Miller, William
Faulkner and (!) Daniel Defoe to open various chapters. Satchel surely
would have loved rubbing elbows with such glittering literati. But the
lofty sentiments don't get Ribowsky any closer to this flesh-and-blood
folk character.
</P>
<P>
Describing his long and lean physique, Satch once said: ``There was
a lot to me, but it was all up and down.'' Whatever was inside seems
to have wafted away, like an unhittable Paige curveball, rising and
swooping in the dim light of an extra-inning game.
</P>
<P>
The book's evocative subtitle, ``Satchel Paige in the Shadows of
Baseball,'' is all too apt. For all Ribowsky's good efforts, the real
shadow here is Satchel himself.

CyberSurfing: Potholes, perturbations and predicaments observed on
the information superhighway:
</P>
<P>
A Playboy story titled ``Orgasms Online'' left one virtual
community more steamed than steamy this spring. The story prominently
featured the Sausalito, Calif.-based WELL (for Whole Earth 'Lectronic
Link) among other services. With perhaps 10,000 members, the WELL is
minuscule by the standards of commercial on-line services like Prodigy
and CompuServe that boast more than a million users. But it has
influence beyond its size because its hundreds of on-line conferences
attract an articulate crowd that includes writers, artists and
high-tech cognoscenti.
</P>
<P>
For the WELLbeings, as many call themselves, Playboy perpetrated an
awful mischaracterization of their electronic hangout. Although there
are areas in which sexuality is discussed, the tone tends toward the
playful. It is also a decidedly more thoughtful place than, say,
America Online, the randier areas of which resemble nothing so much as
a cheap-beer singles bar. Along with making angry accusations that
author Matthew Childs got the story wrong, WELL users said Childs
quoted their on-line postings without permission -- a violation of the
etiquette of the WELL, where the phrase ``You Own Your Own Words'' has
an almost mantra-like quality.
</P>
<P>
One user found that her discussion of an on-line love affair gone
bad had been transmuted by Playboy into an offer to share transcripts
of hot modem sessions with an ex-beau -- an offer she had never made:
</P>
<P>
``... (Y)ou are a liar. I never, ever promised anyone, anywhere,
that I would share `hot chat' transcripts or log with them. I don't
even keep such logs! What I said, Mr. I'm A Journalist And Get My
Facts Straight Bigshot, is that I would share the name of the cybercad
... with people who asked in e-mail.
</P>
<P>
``... (Y)ou can blow it all out your i/o port, bunky.''
</P>
<P>
Worst of all, they said, the publicity is likely to attract the
wrong crowd to the WELL -- namely, horny guys who think that Sausalito
is where the action is.
</P>
<P>
That's exactly what happened. One user, Linda Castellani, said in a
recent on-line interview that ``there has been an increase in those
who were clearly brought here by the article with an expectation of
meeting women and having hot sex.'' Most of the newcomers, however,
don't stick around for long. The WELL is clubby -- to many visitors,
suffocatingly so. That's what the buzz-phrase ``virtual community''
might ultimately come down to: not just who belongs, but who doesn't.
</P>
<P>
It could have been worse. I recall in college an editor at Hef's
mag asked me to hand out questionnaires for the magazine's ``Sexiest
Colleges'' survey, a highly scientific endeavor. I declined, but one
of my roommates was willing. He handed it out at a massive bash; the
questionnaires became the party game; ``can you top this'' fever swept
the assembled multitude. After the party, another roommate took the
remaining questionnaires to a local gay bar.
</P>
<P>
Do you even need to ask? The University of Texas was deemed the
sexiest school in the nation by Playboy.

Early news of Kurt Cobain's death began an explosion of commentary
in the Alternative Rock Forum on America Online. Grieving cries of
shock and anguish meshed with poems and messages to Cobain's wife,
Courtney Love, and their daughter, Frances.
</P>
<P>
But there were also smatterings of mean-spirited assaults on
Cobain, his wife, his music and lifestyle; one was a drawing -- done
with keyboard characters -- that depicted a man with a shotgun in his
mouth.
</P>
<P>
Weirdly enough, Courtney Love's estranged father, Hank Harrison,
joined in the postings. Using the log-on ``BioDad,'' he described
himself in one message as being a ``rich,'' 280-pound man who raises
pit bulls, rides motorcycles and gardens. (A spokesman for Love's
record label confirmed that ``BioDad'' is who he says he is.)
</P>
<P>
In his postings, Harrison said he has been working on a book about
Cobain and Nirvana for two years now, and ``I know things that are so
unbelievable, I couldn't believe them.'' He fears that his daughter is
in danger of ``going with Kurt,'' especially if the child, Frances, is
taken away again. (Child protection authorities did this once after
Vanity Fair reported she had used heroin while pregnant.)
</P>
<P>
Harrison posted a copy of the letter he sent the White House
describing his proposal for a ``Kurt Cobain Foundation for Suicide
Prevention'' and asked that he be invited to meet with the president
and Chelsea to discuss the details. Harrison continues to participate
in the forum despite harsh words from a friend of Love's calling him a
liar and a parasite.

CyberSurfing: Potholes, perturbations and predicaments on the
Information Superhighway:
</P>
<P>
Blowing in the Wind
</P>
<P>
There's been a song going through my head for some time now, only I
don't know the words. Actually, I don't know the tune either, but I
hope to soon -- because of e-mail.
</P>
<P>
The song is ``Hurricane Janet,'' about the storm that hit the
Caribbean in mid-September 1955. It wasn't the worst hurricane of the
century, but because it occurred the week I was born and we had the
same name, I was never allowed to forget it. Growing up in Wisconsin,
I was teased about my eponymous meteorological event, though in fact
my parents had already settled on my name before the hurricane was a
cloud in the sky.
</P>
<P>
Later, when I began to spend time in the Caribbean, gentlemen of a
certain age would start humming the calypso song when they heard my
name. They said the song was by the Mighty Sparrow, the greatest
calypsonian of all time, though it seemed nobody could remember all
the lyrics. I tried to find a recording in the Caribbean, but it was
out of print.
</P>
<P>
After I subscribed to America Online this year, I decided to give
it another try. Searching the service's membership profiles -- brief
resumes in which subscribers can indicate their address, age, hobbies
and any other information they wish to share with other members -- I
located Kevin Burke, a freelance writer, photographer and calypso fan
in Cambridge, Mass. I messaged him about ``Hurricane Janet.''
</P>
<P>
I hit pay dirt. Kevin answered, saying he didn't know the song but
was working on it. First, he had left a telephone message for Sparrow
himself in Trinidad. (For readers unfamiliar with calypso, this is
roughly equivalent to buzzing Frank Sinatra about a '40s pop number.)
Kevin also gave me a list of calypso experts in this country to
consult, including Steve Shapiro, who, he pointed out, lives in Takoma
Park, as my profile showed I do.
</P>
<P>
I recognized the name but I wasn't sure why. Then I realized the
answer was literally in front of my nose, on a list of neighborhood
telephone numbers taped on the wall over my desk: Steve Shapiro,
federal worker and calypso expert, lives across the street, though
we'd never met. I introduced myself and over the next few weeks, we
had several conversations, but while Shapiro's music knowledge and
record collection are both legendary, he didn't have ``Hurricane
Janet.''
</P>
<P>
In mid-March, Burke messaged again. ``I talked to the Mighty
Sparrow today,'' he wrote, ``and he told me that the song about
Hurricane Janet was sung by Lord Melody.'' Melody, a calypso elder
statesman best known for his 1956 classic ``Mama, Look a' Boo-Boo
Dey,'' had died in the 1980s, Burke said. Sparrow had sung a few of
the lyrics to Burke on the telephone:
</P>
<P>
``Janet, stay in the mountains!
</P>
<P>
``Janet, you go blow down plenty buildings!
</P>
<P>
``Janet, your sister is Katie!
</P>
<P>
``Janet, go straight to Miami!''
</P>
<P>
I ran across the street to tell Steve, who said he had some Melody
recordings and would look into the matter. The next day, I walked out
my door to find Steve in his front yard, waving his arms and shouting
something. I finally made out the words: ``Janet! It is by Sparrow!!''
Steve had located a fellow calypso maven in Oneonta, N.Y., who had a
recording of my song. Apparently, Sparrow either meant that he had
sung the song but didn't write it, or had recorded so many songs over
the years that he had simply forgotten.
</P>
<P>
Now, I'm waiting for the tape of my song to arrive by
``snail-mail'' -- the U.S. Postal Service. Until then, I have another
project: How about this Hurricane Katie?

``MAKE.MONEY.FAST'' read the message sent recently to hundreds of
subscribers to ``DEAF-L,'' a computer discussion list for people
interested in deafness-related issues. The note was filled with
heartrending tales of people who had been down to their last few
dollars when a miraculous solution appeared in the form of an e-mail
letter. Suddenly their bank accounts were full, their spirits were
lifted, and they were overcome with the desire to share the secret of
their wealth with their fellow Internet travelers.
</P>
<P>
In summary, the note's words of wisdom were this: Send $10 to the
person at the top of this mailing list, add your name to the bottom
and send it to 100 friends.
</P>
<P>
That's right, it was one of those chain letters that kids -- and
gullible adults -- copy and mail out to their friends. Now they've hit
cyberspace and the possibilities are endless. With one message, one
can, as the DEAF-L subscriber did, send the chain to hundreds, even
thousands of people. Cyberspace legal experts -- who were consulted
through a posting on their discussion group CYBERIA-L -- said such a
chain may constitute a pyramid scheme and posting it on the Internet
might be illegal under the statutes prohibiting wire fraud.
</P>
<P>
The ``send money now'' chain isn't the only old chestnut floating
around cyberspace. Remember Craig Shergold, the ailing kid who was
once trying to collect a record number of business cards? That effort
stopped years ago, but just last week an e-mail asking for business
cards appeared on several discussion lists. The infamous cookie recipe
that Neiman Marcus allegedly sold for $250 -- a story the store
adamantly denies -- showed up not once but twice recently on a
discussion list for fans of the ``Highlander'' movies and television
show.
</P>
<P>
``This is a perfect example of how Internet perpetuates Urban
Legends and is a perfect example of how things should not be reposted
everywhere,'' wrote DEAF-L subscriber Claire Maier in an effort to
forestall further chain postings.
</P>
<P>
``The only explanation I have is that people are sheep,'' wrote
Maier, a PhD candidate in neuroscience at Emory University. ``Someone
says, `Post this to a zillion newsgroups ...' and people do it.''

 Travel in Croatia: Cautions and Concerns 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After any disaster, the question always arises as to when a
destination that has been hard hit -- whether by hurricane, earthquake,
fire, flood or war -- is ready to give visitors their money's worth.
Often these places, although not yet in the best shape, will offer an
incentive to tempt more adventurous travelers to be the first to
return.
</P>
<P>
Such is the case of war-torn Croatia, which is desperately in need
of the potentially lucrative tourist income. This summer, and perhaps
for another year, it is promising low prices-particularly for lodging.
In the beautiful old resort city of Dubrovnik, I stayed last month for
about $70 a night -- less than half the price I had paid for not nearly
as nice a hotel room a few days earlier in Milan, Italy. Right now,
rooms in private homes in Dubrovnik are going for as little as $10 a
night.
</P>
<P>
``The prices are very low,'' says Pave Zupan Ruskovic, president of
Atlas, one of Croatia's biggest travel agencies. ``It's one way to
bring tourism back.''
</P>
<P>
This is, I think, a fair exchange. With a civil war still rumbling
in neighboring Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia is a problematic
destination and personal safety is a matter of at least some concern.
But at bargain prices, the new country is also an inviting place -- at
least for those who are aware of the drawbacks of a visit.
</P>
<P>
Before its breakup, Yugoslavia was a popular vacation spot for
other Europeans and for Americans. As it happens, the new Croatia now
possesses old Yugoslavia's primary tourist asset, the long, still
mostly pristine Adriatic Coast stretching south from the Istrian
Peninsula to Dubrovnik. Among the nations formed from Yugoslavia, its
tourism prospects are brightest.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the U.S. State Department is warning Americans to stay
away from Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia-Herzegovina because of
continuing strife or safety problems. No such warning has been issued
for Croatia, neighboring Slovenia and the former Yugoslav republic of
Macedonia. Slovenia is probably least affected by the ongoing Bosnian
crisis, and it offers plenty of scenic and cultural attractions and
good dining and lodging. Macedonia is a developing nation with limited
tourist facilities.
</P>
<P>
The severe impact of the war on Croatia's tourist income is evident
in statistics quoted by national tourism officials. Before 1990,
Croatia reported 60 million overnight stays annually, says Velimir
Simicic, Croatia's deputy minister of tourism. In 1993, the figure was
only 13 million -- most of them Germans and Eastern Europeans
vacationing on the Istrian Peninsula. This summer, the country hopes
to double last year's number. Before the war, the city of Dubrovnik
counted on tourism for about 90 percent of its income.
</P>
<P>
Should you go to Croatia now to take advantage of the bargains or
wait until peace is assured? It is a question individuals must answer
for themselves. Some factors to consider:
</P>
<P>
-- Safety
</P>
<P>
The situation in Zagreb, the capital; on the Istrian Peninsula; and
in most areas of Croatia is calm, says the State Department. But it
warns against travel to four United Nations Protected Areas that
border Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia. Localized shelling has occurred
adjacent to these areas. With one important exception, the Adriatic
Coast -- the principal destination that Croatia currently is promoting
 -- is not affected.
</P>
<P>
The exception is the coastal road just north of Zadar, where a
pontoon bridge replaces the former bridge that was destroyed in
Croatia's war to defend its independence. The bridge, which crosses an
inlet, is within potential enemy shellfire, according to a public
affairs officer in the U.S. Embassy in Zagreb, who asked not to be
identified.
</P>
<P>
However, the bridge is open, and motorists -- including tourists -- 
are using it regularly without harm, says Karen Suric in Atlas's New
York office. According to her, travelers who want to drive the length
of the Adriatic Coast to Dubrovnik but avoid the bridge can take an
auto ferry that operates far outside the shelling range.
</P>
<P>
As for street crime directed at tourists, incidents are low. But as
in any country, you should beware of pickpockets and muggers in
tourist sites such as bus and railway stations.
</P>
<P>
For a current safety report, contact the State Department's
Citizens Emergency Center, (202) 647-5225, or the U.S. Embassy in
Zagreb, 011-385-41-444-800.
</P>
<P>
-- Visas
</P>
<P>
Americans must have a visa to travel in Croatia, but a tourist visa
valid for three months can be obtained at no cost on arrival -- either
at border crossings or the airport. There is a drawback to this
process, however. When I arrived by plane in Zagreb, about 25
passengers werelined up at the visa window, and only one immigration
officer was on duty. Each visa took him two or three minutes to fill
out. I was near the end of the line and waited for more than a half
hour. Only after I had my visa could I proceed through immigration to
baggage claim and customs. Also, the Croatian Embassy in Washington
warns that some airlines deny boarding for flights to Croatia if you
don't have a visa.
</P>
<P>
To avoid a delay, you can apply for a visa in person or by mail
from the Croatian Embassy, 2343 Massachusetts Ave. NW, Washington,
D.C. 20008, (202) 588-5899. Embassy-issued visas are valid for 12
months. By mail, there is a $9 return postage fee.
</P>
<P>
-- Where to Go Stay
</P>
<P>
As in the past, most visitors probably will stick close to the
lovely turquoise waters of the Adriatic. Although lodgings from modest
to luxurious dot the long coast and the many offshore islands, the
area is relatively undeveloped in contrast to the French or Italian
rivieras.
</P>
<P>
In the north, the Istrian Peninsula and the offshore islands of
Krk, Cres, Rab and Pag offer excellent beach vacation possibilities in
an area untouched by the war. It is easily reached by car from
northern Italy and elsewhere in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The area around Dubrovnik experienced heavy damage. Beach pleasures
are possible, but the ancient city should appeal more to travelers
interested in seeing the impact of the war for themselves and the
recovery that is being made. Among the top hotels now open are the
Hotel Argentina; its neighboring affiliate, the beautiful Villa Orsula
(where I stayed); and the charming Hotel Villa Dubrovnik. All are
within a 10-minute walk of the old city. A 10-minute drive away is the
large and modern Hotel Dubrovnik President. All feature either sand or
rocky beaches and good sea views.
</P>
<P>
At the Hotel Argentina, a room for one is about $58; for two, about
$90. At the Villa Orsula, a single is $68 and a double is $116.
Breakfast is included. Other top hotels are in the same price range.
But budget travelers can stay in a room in a private home for about
$10 for one or two people.
</P>
<P>
Zagreb is pretty and culturally interesting, and there are scenic
drives north of the city into countryside that still retains the look
of old Europe. Because Zagreb gets a lot of business travelers, its
hotel rates are higher. Rates in the best hotels-which include the
Palace, Dubrovnik, Inter-continental and Esplanade-range from about
$95 to $150 a night for a room.
</P>
<P>
Some tours have resumed out of Split to the Catholic shrine of
Medugorje, which is located across the border in Bosnia. Aboard my
plane from Zurich, a group of 16 New Englanders planned a week's
pilgrimage. However, the U.S. Embassy in Croatia discourages such
trips, says a spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
Escorted sightseeing and outdoor adventure tours and
air/hotel/rental car packages are available throughout most U.S. or
Croatian travel agencies. I paid Atlas $879 for a package that
included two nights lodging in Zagreb, three nights in Dubrovnik, five
full breakfasts, flights between Zagreb and Dubrovnik and Split and
Zagreb, a car and driver between Dubrovnik and Split, and all airport
transfers.
</P>
<P>
For Information: Croatia does not maintain a tourism information
office in the United States. However, information -- including lodging
choices and island ferry schedules -- is available from Atlas
Ambassador of Dubrovnik, the New York office of the Atlas travel
agency (Lincoln Building, 60 E. 42nd St., New York, N.Y. 10165,
212-697-6767).

 Author of `Alice in Wonderland' Is Profiled 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is Lewis Carroll's timeless ``Alice's Adventures in Wonderland''
simply an innocent children's story? Those who think so are in for a
fascinating glance through the looking glass, courtesy of The Learning
Channel's ``Great Books'' series, running Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
The fourth installment of the Donald Sutherland-hosted series
brings the background of mathematics professor Charles Lutwidge
Dodgson (alias Lewis Carroll) out of the rabbit hole, describing how
his view of childhood contrasted with the rigid social standards of
1860s Victorian England.
</P>
<P>
This program is not necessarily recommended for younger eyes, but
it is required viewing for anyone who has read Lewis Carroll stories
to their children.
</P>
<P>
The story of the independent Alice had its genesis on a Thames boat
ride on July 4, 1862, when Dodgson related a tale to 9-year-old Alice
Liddell, daughter of the dean of Christ Church in Oxford.
</P>
<P>
On Christmas of that year, Dodgson presented young Alice with a
hand-illustrated copy of ``Alice's Adventures Underground.'' The
following year, he enlisted Punch cartoonist John Tenniel to
illustrate the renamed ``Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.''
</P>
<P>
That book and the follow-up, ``Through the Looking Glass,'' trail
only the Bible and the works of Shakespeare as the most quoted books
in the English language.
</P>
<P>
The ``Great Books'' program shows many of the hundreds of takeoffs
and provides a look at how the 1960s popular culture melded with the
works of 100 years earlier. (Jefferson Airplane lead singer Grace
Slick, who recorded the 1967 hit ``White Rabbit,'' noted a half-dozen
drug references in Carroll's writings.)
</P>
<P>
We also see Carroll on the front of the Beatles' ``Sgt. Pepper''
album, and a snippet from the more recent ``Don't Come Around Here No
More'' video featuring Tom Petty as the Mad Hatter.
</P>
<P>
Carroll, described as ``a very clever man with the heart of a
child,'' is a very complex study. The author of the book that
celebrates identity perhaps wrestled with his own identity.
</P>
<P>
The program explores whether he used drugs or gave them to the
young girls he entertained and photographed. After all, the ``Alice''
stories, unlike most books of the times, are conspicuously without
morals.
</P>
<P>
The master of nonsense was also a scholar of logic. Queen Victoria,
after reading ``Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,'' said she wanted to
read Carroll's next book, which turned out to be a treatise on
simultaneous linear equations.
</P>
<P>
Upcoming ``Great Books'' programs will study H.G. Wells's ``War of
the Worlds'' (June 11) and ``The Art of War'' (June 18).

 Circumcision Pain an Elusive Target 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New research has found that acetaminophen doesn't reduce the pain
during and immediately following circumcision.
</P>
<P>
While acetominophen is safe and easily administered to newborns,
the researchers said, ``the pain of circumcision is too severe to be
controlled by a mild analgesic.''
</P>
<P>
Acetaminophen (the active ingredient in Tylenol) does seems to work
against persistent discomfort at six hours after circumcision,
however, according to a study by University of Rochester School of
Medicine and Dentistry researchers. The study appears in last month's
Pediatrics, published by the American Academy of Pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
About 86 percent of American male newborns undergo circumcision,
the most common surgical procedure performed on males in this country,
the study said. Most of these circumcisions are done without
painkillers.
</P>
<P>
A local anesthetic procedure called dorsal penile nerve block has
been found effective against circumcision pain, the researchers said,
but is not widely used because of concerns about its safety, the time
it takes to administer and a continued belief that babies don't feel
much pain.
</P>
<P>
The new study, in line with previous research, concluded that
circumcised newborns do experience great and persistent pain during
and after the surgery, based on crying, increased heart and breathing
rates and other measurements.
</P>
<P>
The discomfort from the surgery also seemed to interfere with
breastfeeding in some newborns, who required formula supplements.
</P>
<P>
Breast-feeding takes more-active participation on the part of
newborns, who have to learn to latch on to the breast and suckle, than
the more-free-flowing bottle, said Cynthia R. Howard, the lead
researcher on the study. After circumcision, babies can be more
difficult to awaken, and this may frustrate mothers who themselves are
just learning to breast-feed, she added. Howard said she plans to
follow up this study to see if there is any long-term impact on

 Hormone in Breast Milk May Help Babies Develop 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Breast milk has long been appreciated for the nourishment it
provides and for its rich supply of antibodies that help newborns
fight infections. Now research suggests that breasts also produce
large quantities of a hormone that may aid the development of a
newborn's brain and sexual organs, and may also affect the health of
the mother's breast itself.
</P>
<P>
Scientists said the findings, which were made in experiments on
rats but appear to be true for humans as well, strengthen the argument
for breast feeding and may lead to new strategies for fighting breast
cancer.
</P>
<P>
Researchers have known for years that the hormone,
gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), is made in the hypothalamus of
the brain in adults, where it influences sex-organ growth, the
reproductive cycle and sexual behavior in rats and people. Pregnant
women also make the hormone in the placenta, where it gets passed to
the embryo and has a major influence on fetal brain development.
</P>
<P>
Now researchers at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovet,
Israel, have found that in lactating rats large amounts of GnRH are
made in breast tissues. The hormone is probably also made in human
breast tissues, they said, since human breast milk has been found to
be loaded with the hormone.
</P>
<P>
The researchers, led by neuroendocrinologist Yitzhak Koch, propose
that the GnRH in breast milk may help complete certain aspects of
brain or sex-organ development left unfinished during the fetus' stay
in the uterus.
</P>
<P>
Breast-milk GnRH may be especially important to a newborn rat,
since rat brains are still largely undeveloped even after birth. Human
brains are more fully developed at birth, so the importance of GnRH in
human breast milk remains uncertain. But even human brains change
substantially in the first years of life and may benefit from the
hormone, Koch and others said.
</P>
<P>
``It could be important for the physiology of the developing
baby,'' said Donald Pfaff, a neurobiologist at Rockefeller University
in New York. But he stressed that further experiments are needed to
see whether the hormone can survive in the digestive tract of a
suckling newborn or is deactivated there.
</P>
<P>
Sergio R. Ojeda, head of neuroscience at the Oregon Regional
Primate Center in Beaverton, said researchers discovered a few years
ago that breast milk contains fatty acids, which are critical for
growth, and taurine, which aids in the absorption of nutrients, and
that baby formula companies had subsequently added those ingredients
to their products. He said GnRH may be the latest such discovery, and
he predicted that further research would bring other hormonal benefits
of breast milk to light.
</P>
<P>
Margaret Wierman, an endocrinologist at the University of Colorado
Health Sciences Center, said the new finding was potentially important
for women too because many breast-cancer cells grow in response to
GnRH. She said studies of how the production of GnRH is regulated in
the breast may someday lead to new ways of blocking breast-cancer
growth.
</P>
<P>
The new research appears in this week's issue of the Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences.

 Breaking Through Barriers in S. Africa's Health Care 
 Trafford is editor of The Washington Post's Health section. 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was the surgical head nurse who turned the South African
hospital upside down. She needed a gynecologist, and it made perfect
sense to her to choose Dr. E.T. Mokgokong, who would soon become
deputy head of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Natal.
</P>
<P>
Except that it was 20 years ago at the height of apartheid and the
nurse was white and Dr. Mokgokong is black.
</P>
<P>
``She caused complete pandemonium in the hospital,'' the doctor
recalled. After all, it was a black hospital. Although the staff was
mostly white, the patients were black. Why wouldn't the nurse go to
the hospital for whites? ``She told them: `My gynie is Dr. Mokgokong,'
'' he continued. Very delicate, very shocking. He remembers her asking
the disapproving white staff: ``Whose body is going to be examined?''
</P>
<P>
That stamp of approval helped establish him in the old South
Africa. It also convinced him that an academic degree and the
stethoscope were the most potent weapons he could wield against the
apartheid government.
</P>
<P>
This month, a new era began as blacks who represent four-fifths of
the population took control of the government. One of the most
immediate challenges is to build a national health-care system to meet
the needs of a swelling non-white population.
</P>
<P>
Black children have death rates that are 12 times higher than
white, according to government figures. Diseases such as typhoid and
tuberculosis, rare among whites, are major killers of South African
blacks. More than half the children admitted to a black teaching
hospital last year were found to be suffering from malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
A critical problem is the lack of black health-care professionals.
Currently there are about 1,200 black physicians for an estimated
population of 30 million. This compares with 25,000 white doctors for
about 5 million whites.
</P>
<P>
For decades Mokgokong, 63, has been a kind of education warrior on
the health-care battlefield. He heads the Medical University of
Southern Africa (Medunsa), founded in 1978 for black students. Last
week, he was in Washington to receive an award from Medical Education
for South African Blacks, a non-profit organization that funds medical
scholarships.
</P>
<P>
Mokgokong grew up on a farm, the youngest of seven children. His
father was a teacher and Lutheran minister. At 19, he passed the
standard examinations to enter a university. After earning a science
degree at Fort Hare University, Mokgokong received his medical degree
at the University of Natal in 1962.
</P>
<P>
He belongs to South Africa's pioneer black generation of
``First- -Onlys'': First black on the university faculty, one of the
only blacks on the hospital teaching staff; first only black to head
a South African medical school.
</P>
<P>
``First- -Only'' pioneers (blacks or women or members of any
outsider group) can break the barriers of the discriminating culture -- 
but not its rules. They survive and even excel by working within the
system and in the process they target the culture's limits. First
Mokgokong broke the ability barrier when he decided to specialize in
obstetrics and gynecology and pursue a career on the prestigious track
of academic medicine.
</P>
<P>
``The early days were very difficult,'' he said. ``We were always
taking the job of a white.''
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mokgokong had to prove he was not only just as good as
his white counterparts, but better. That's why it was a turning point
when the surgical head nurse chose him to be her doctor. He also had a
mentor in the chief of the ob-gyn department. ``I became his blue-eyed
boy,'' he jokingly recalled.
</P>
<P>
But eventually ``First- -Onlys'' crack up against the culture's
glass ceiling. When his department chief retired, Mokgokong applied
for the director's job -- and was passed over.
</P>
<P>
A few years later, he crossed a personal and political Rubicon and
switched to the all-black medical school. The move was highly
controversial. To many in South Africa, Medunsa was seen as a tool of
apartheid to keep blacks separate and disenfranchised. To some,
learning itself was a form of submission. ``Liberation first,
education later'' was the revolutionary slogan.
</P>
<P>
But to an education warrior like Mokgokong, it was the other way
around. Education equaled liberation. Spare the book, he believed, and
spoil the child's future. He consulted his political friends, some of
them in exile, and got their backing to go to Medunsa because, as he
said, ``the institution in the long run will be a training area for
black people.''
</P>
<P>
Today roughly 60 percent of practicing black physicians in South
Africa are graduates of Medunsa. While other universities are opening
the door to black applicants, Medunsa remains the primary medical
training ground for blacks.
</P>
<P>
Yet, in the euphoria of liberation, Mokgokong is not resting on his
laurels. Apartheid may be overturned, but his education war goes on.
He has already started with his family. One son is a neurosurgeon,
another is a general practitioner, his wife is a social worker.
</P>
<P>
``I hope we can keep our level head and not go into a dictatorship
to deal with the violence,'' he said. ``The main thing is to bring
back the culture of learning and teaching.''

 `Restoring Democracy': Haiti's Problem -- Or Ours? 
 Mathews is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what may be a new record, the most recent U.S. policy on Haiti,
whose centerpiece is tougher sanctions, was declared futile even
before it came into effect on May 21. Among widely opposing views on
every other aspect of Haitian policy, all sides agreed on just one
point: that the still untested sanctions would not suffice to drive
Haiti's military regime from power.
</P>
<P>
Administration officials, who had just devised the policy, freely
but anonymously admitted as much to reporters. Supporters of
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who only a few weeks before were fiercely
urging tighter sanctions, agreed. Their earlier conviction that
``sanctions had never been given a chance'' because the old set was
too weak shifted almost overnight to the view that unmistakable
readiness to use force was necessary. The president, listing reasons
why an invasion would be in the U.S. interest, was described by aides
as trying to build public support for military action.
</P>
<P>
If, as seems nearly certain, the sanctions don't do the job, the
administration will have far fewer options than it had a few weeks
ago. A policy designed to buy time and options already seems to have
achieved the reverse.
</P>
<P>
Now, abandoning sanctions on the grounds that the necessary
conditions for democracy don't exist today in Haiti, would seem too
stark a retreat. Indefinite negotiations would seem obviously
fruitless. Tightening the sanctions still further risks destabilizing
the Dominican Republic and would bring unacceptable suffering for
Haitians. The remaining option -- unless President Aristide were to
voluntarily step aside -- is an invasion.
</P>
<P>
Five arguments have been advanced in favor of such a step: that
U.S. values and post-Cold War global strategy demand that we ``restore
democracy'' to Haiti; that U.S. credibility is unacceptably harmed by
thugs who ``thumb their noses'' at us; that restoring President
Aristide is the only way to reduce the number of refugees heading our
way; that removing the current military leaders will reduce drug
trafficking to the United States; that only such an all out-effort can
dispel charges of a racist policy.
</P>
<P>
Close inspection reveals glaring weaknesses in most of these
arguments. Haitian drug trafficking, for example, is not a large
source of what's on America's streets. If that were motive for an
invasion, a dozen other countries should come first. Other reasons
offered by President Clinton-Haiti's proximity, the fact that many
Haitians live here and Americans live in Haiti, and the fact that
Haiti and Cuba are the only remaining non-democracies in the
hemisphere -- are accurate descriptions but hardly reasons for military
action.
</P>
<P>
What is noteworthy about this list is that only the first argument
addresses Haiti's problems; the rest address our own. Making foreign
policy with an eye to domestic opinion is one thing. Making foreign
policy to resolve domestic concerns with only an occasional eye to the
actual problems abroad is quite another, and unlikely to end
successfully.
</P>
<P>
``Restoring democracy,'' therefore, is the crux of the matter. But
is it also a delusion? We can reinstate a freely elected president who
is the choice of most Haitians. But a single election does not create
a democracy. The election that brought President Aristide to power was
an aberration in Haitian politics, made possible only by the presence
of large teams of foreign observers.
</P>
<P>
The political norm is rampant corruption, stolen or canceled
elections, coups d'etat and violence. Democracy can only be homegrown.
An established democracy that has been usurped can be restored through
outside force. A fledgling democracy, receptive to the rule of law and
to the right of peaceful political dissent, can be helped along. But
it is questionable -- and worthy of a serious debate that has not
occurred -- whether Haiti can be lastingly helped at this point in its
political evolution through armed intervention.
</P>
<P>
To leave behind a functioning democracy in Haiti, an invasion would
have to: disarm the military; reinstate Aristide; prevent the
traditional violent retribution against those leaving power; create
Haiti's first well-trained, civilian controlled police, distinct from
the military; keep order for months to years; uproot and remove
antidemocractic elements of the military and economic elite; provide
massive development assistance, get along with Aristide through thick
and thin; help forge a moderate political consensus, and be prepared
to re-intervene if it collapses. These tasks get harder and more
dangerous as the liberators become occupiers and the large initial
force shrinks to a smaller number of peace enforcers. Lives will be
lost to paid and random violence. At what point would the United
States declare its job done?
</P>
<P>
Invasion advocates argue that it could be very early, with the
longer, harder job turned over to an ad hoc international coalition or
U.N. peace-keeping force. Other countries can be expected to hold a
different view. Moreover, a U.N. force would have to be vetoed by the
United States, since its open-ended mandate could not meet the
conditions of the president's new peace-keeping policy.
</P>
<P>
If democracy cannot be restored because it hasn't previously
existed in Haiti, Americans will have to decide how they feel about
military action for the purpose of keeping out refugees or as a means
of demonstrating the president's toughness. The threat to American
credibility, however, does not come from Port-au-Prince. It lies in
the possibility that we will start something we cannot finish out of
little more than frustration, or become hopelessly tangled in a policy
riddled with internal contradictions because it is principally
designed to meet domestic imperatives.

 Humorous Manifesto Tells Bureaucrats: Stress is Good (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some people in the federal government never get a pat
on the back. Ever hear anybody loving up the IRS (``Gee, great
tax!'')? Or the Postal Service (``Really quick -- and cheap!'')? Or the
Border Patrol (``Boy, those people won't dare try that again!'')?
</P>
<P>
Or the U.S. Agency for International Development, charged with
administering foreign aid, one of the nation's favorite spending
priorities. (``Wow, I loved the way you took the $5 million that was
supposed to pay for my children's textbooks and built that beautiful
bridge in Milcamagnesia!'').
</P>
<P>
One school of thought holds that shepherding foreign aid through
Congress is what transformed House Appropriations Committee Chairman
David R. Obey, D-Wis., into such a cuddly guy.
</P>
<P>
Jay Byrne, AID's press spokesman, put it another way: ``Let's just
say foreign assistance doesn't have much of a constituency. Every time
you turn a corner there's someone standing there with a baseball
bat.''
</P>
<P>
In an effort to lighten up his troops, Byrne (and others, he
insists) in March devised a ``Stress Management Program,'' a copy of
which was obtained by The Washington Post. The basic principle:
</P>
<P>
``You all want to stay stressed, and stress is good for moral!''
</P>
<P>
Stress may also have caused this spelling lapse, but so what?
Stress ``helps you avoid responsibility,'' the manifesto said. ``This
gets you off the hook for all the mundane chores; let someone else
take care of them.'' In other words, blame the proofreader.
</P>
<P>
Byrne, 32, once worked in former Boston mayor Raymond L. Flynn's
office, where, he acknowledged, ``people had more fun'' than they do
wandering around among the egomaniacs down here. What a surprise.
</P>
<P>
According to Byrne, AID has been especially stressed because
``dramatic changes'' have made the agency ``what we like to call the
number one laboratory for reinventing government.''
</P>
<P>
In the Clinton administration this sort of reinvention quack-quack
is slang for layoffs and budget cutbacks, but Byrne makes a convincing
case that other stuff is happening, too.
</P>
<P>
When last you tuned in, Byrne noted, AID was always being accused
of running expensive, inefficient, hugely stupid projects whose only
apparent purpose was to keep corrupt Third World dictatorships from
going communist.
</P>
<P>
``When we (the Clintonites) first showed up,'' Byrne noted, ``nine
out of 10 phone calls from journalists focused on potential abuses,
dissatisfaction and misunderstanding.''
</P>
<P>
Now the communists are gone, Byrne said, ``the Cold War dictums no
longer apply,'' and AID is shutting down in 23 countries. Some of
these are long-term friendlies who have allegedly ``graduated''
(Thailand, Costa Rica, Botswana) to become ``developed countries.''
</P>
<P>
Others are short-term friendly ``graduates'' who apparently were
always developed, they just didn't know it (Estonia, the former
Czechoslovakia). And a few are Third World dictatorships where nothing
good ever seems to happen (Zaire).
</P>
<P>
So the good news for foreign aid haters is that we're cutting all
these countries off. Maybe they no longer need us, as AID would have
us believe, or maybe we no longer need them, since nobody's going
communist anymore.
</P>
<P>
Whatever, it should be noted that this is not real money. Of the $7
billion in the current foreign aid budget, Byrne says, only $2 billion
is funding ``sustainable development'' projects in the Third World.
The rest is either being used to keep old friends from throttling each
other (Israel and Egypt) or to keep new friends from getting crazy
(the former Soviet Union).
</P>
<P>
So, if you've only got $2 billion to massage, tempers can get
short. Also, Byrne said nobody can smoke in the office anymore,
``which has caused quite a bit of stress,'' and relations with AID's
closest associates, the State Department and the U.S. Information
Agency, remain snarly.
</P>
<P>
Thus the stress manifesto recommends ``worry about things you
cannot control,'' including Voice of America foreign aid editorials,
which the AID press office must painstakingly read and clear, even
though, ``frankly, you wonder who's interested,'' Byrne said.
</P>
<P>
The manifesto also notes that ``stress helps you seem important.
Evidence: the State Department,'' but Byrne refused to expand on this
statement. Later, however, he admitted that ``you are reminding me
that at the time we wrote this, it was a lot of fun.'' And good for
moral.

 An Actor Who Was There Helps TV Memorialize D-Day 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles Durning tucked away his D-Day memories 50 years ago. They
were so painful he's rarely unpacked them since.
</P>
<P>
Durning is the only survivor of a unit that landed on Omaha Beach
that June 6 in 1944. He holds the Silver Star for valor and three
Purple Hearts for wounds he suffered.
</P>
<P>
He was an infantryman, only 17. But so were the German soldiers on
the bluffs above, strafing the Normandy beach from concrete bunkers
that are still there.
</P>
<P>
Durning survived the invasion -- he had to kill seven German gunners
to do it -- and suffered serious machine-gun wounds to his right leg
and shrapnel wounds over his body.
</P>
<P>
Later he was stabbed eight times by a bayonet-wielding German
teenager. He killed that soldier with a rock. A few months after that,
he was taken prisoner at the Battle of the Bulge, survived a massacre
of other prisoners, then had to return to help identify the bodies. A
bullet in the chest finally ended his wartime duty.
</P>
<P>
Durning endured four years of hospitalizations for his physical and
psychological wounds. ``I'd like to have a decade of my life back,''
he said. ``I dropped into a void for almost a decade. It's your mind
that's hard to heal. There are many horrifying secrets in the depths
of our souls that we don't want anyone to know about.''
</P>
<P>
Later Durning found that his brother in the Navy also had been part
of the landing.
</P>
<P>
The invasion of Omaha Beach was assigned to the United States' 1st
Infantry Division, to which Durning belonged, and the untested 29th
Division from Maryland and Virginia. More than 70,000 men went ashore
on D-Day, 15,000 of them to their deaths.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Durning has been unpacking his D-Day
recollections. During a spring visit to Washington, he discussed his
experiences guardedly. Those experiences, along with his familiar
television presence, made him an ideal choice to take part in a
Memorial Day event and two productions pegged to the 50th anniversary
of the Normandy invasion.
</P>
<P>
Sunday evening, Durning will appear at the National Memorial Day
Concert to read a letter written by a 19-year-old American soldier
describing the horror of that day.
</P>
<P>
Monday night, on The Discovery Channel's ``Normandy: The Great
Crusade,'' Durning does the narration and reads a poem written by a
22-year-old paratrooper.
</P>
<P>
Durning has also taped an account of the invasion by Ernest
Hemingway for inclusion in a ``CBS Reports'' special on D-Day airing
Thursday night and hosted by Dan Rather and retired Gen. H. Norman
Schwarzkopf.
</P>
<P>
Durning's colleague from CBS's ``Evening Shade,'' Ossie Davis, will
host the 90-minute Memorial Day concert on PBS, the fifth produced for
that holiday by Jerry Colbert of Pathmakers Inc., and Washington
public station WETA. This one focuses not only on the soldiers of
D-Day, but also on the American nurses who served in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Durning, concert headliners include Grammy-winning
country singer Clint Black, who has written a song, ``American
Soldier,'' for the occasion; musician Doc Severinsen; actresses Mary
McDonnell and Jill Clayburgh, who will read letters written by nurses;
singers Harolyn Blackwell and Maureen McGovern; and the National
Symphony Orchestra conducted by Erich Kunzel, with a military chorus
doing selections that will include Beethoven's ``Ode to Joy.''
</P>
<P>
Brass on board are to include Gen. John Shalikashvili, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff; his predecessor, retired Gen. Colin Powell;
and the chief of each armed service.
</P>
<P>
Durning choked up a little while taping his narration for the
Discovery documentary. His recitation before thousands of people at
the Memorial Day concert could be an emotional challenge. He'll be
looking into television cameras, but he asked Colbert not to require
him to face the war footage to be shown behind him.
</P>
<P>
Concert host Ossie Davis will understand. An Army medic stationed
in Liberia, he was manning the base radio station in early June 1944
when he ran into a military-news blackout. He learned about the D-Day
landing from the BBC and announced it to the local troops.
</P>
<P>
It was Davis who was instrumental in securing Durning's appearance
at the concert. Reminded over a lunch in April with his wife, actress
Ruby Dee, and Colbert that Durning was part of the first wave onto
Omaha Beach, Davis suddenly realized that his friend would be ideal to
read the letter and leaped up to call the sitcom's production office.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later, Colbert was in Los Angeles talking with Durning,
who had read the script for the concert and agreed to appear. Plans
call for him to leave the stage briefly to shake hands with other
D-Day veterans in the audience.
</P>
<P>
Like Davis and Colbert, Susan and Christopher Koch, producers of
the Discovery documentary, and executive producer Tim F. Cowling
thought the same thing: Durning would be perfect. But they nearly
missed him. They had contacted his agent but heard nothing.
</P>
<P>
``We thought, `He just doesn't want to have anything to do with
it,' '' said Susan Koch. ``We were into casting the (voices), and his
agent called and said, `Charlie wants to do anything. He'll read one
line.' We felt it was meant to be.''
</P>
<P>
It seems that Durning's stepdaughter, as aspiring actress, had seen
a copy of the script that had somehow never reached Durning and
insisted he read it. After 50 years of suppressed memories, he decided
it was what he wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
``We didn't get an actor, we got a Normandy veteran who happens to
be an actor, and that was precisely what the film called for,'' said
Chris Koch.
</P>
<P>
For the actor, doing the narration stirred emotions. A careful
listener may catch a tremor in Durning's voice at times during the
program.
</P>
<P>
Durning and Chris Koch talked for several hours beforehand about
Durning's experiences. ``He said, `You know, everybody who was there
is in some state of denial. There are things I'll take to my grave.'
''
</P>
<P>
Durning was with ``The Big Red One,'' the 1st Division, which went
into Omaha Beach with the 29th Division from Maryland and Virginia.
</P>

``We picked the 29th because they had never been in combat

Actor Charles Durning grew up in Highland Falls, N.Y., near the
U.S. Military Academy at West Point.
</P>
<P>
His father, an Irish immigrant who had joined the Army to gain U.S.
citizenship, lost a leg during World War I and died when Charles was
12. The elder Durning's widow supported her five children by working
as a laundress at West Point.
</P>
<P>
``I never went to college; barely got out of high school,'' Durning
said. ``I finished high school when I came out of the Army.''
</P>
<P>
All along, what Durning really wanted to do was act. ``I was
enamored of acting from the first time I saw `King Kong,' '' he said.
``When I saw Cagney, I just went crazy.''
</P>
<P>
At 16, he was working as an usher at a Buffalo burlesque house that
featured bawdy comics. ``They chose to believe I was 21,'' he said of
the management.
</P>
<P>
After the war Durning used dancing as physical therapy to
strengthen his badly injured leg, and speech therapy to smooth a
stutter that had developed.
</P>
<P>
He began training at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts but was
told he lacked talent. So he worked as a dancer and played small roles
with Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare Company.
</P>
<P>
A role in Papp's ``That Championship Season'' on Broadway in 1973
led to one in a film, ``The Sting.'' Durning went on to do more than
70 movies. Nominated for two Oscars and eight Emmys, and the recipient
of Golden Globe and Drama Desk awards, he won a Tony as Big Daddy in a
1990 Broadway revival of ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.''
</P>
<P>
Sometimes Durning thinks about the loss to the country wrought by
war. ``Only the flower of our youth, only the best -- the most healthy,
the brightest -- are allowed to go,'' he said. ``Think of all the
poets, the playwrights, the philosophers, the scientists, the
statesman that were lost.''

 Seeking to Take the Guesswork Out of Federal Contracts 
 (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Office of Management and Budget has announced a
new pilot project designed to ease some of Washington's chronic
procurement problems, such as cost overruns and lack of competition on
large contracts.
</P>
<P>
The government spends about $105 billion each year on ``contracting
out,'' buying services that range from grass-cutting and painting to
highly complex scientific research and analysis.
</P>
<P>
The announcement this week by OMB Director Leon E. Panetta said the
pilot project would encourage federal agencies government-wide to
refashion some of their existing service contracts to reflect
performance-based standards. They would include price, level of
competition, number of contract audits and length of the procurement
cycle.
</P>
<P>
``This pilot project will help to streamline the procurement
process and create a better work environment between the government
and service contractors,'' Panetta said.
</P>
<P>
For the experiment, agencies would convert contracts that offer
ways to measure before-and-after results, and move from
cost-reimbursement contracts to fixed-priced contracts. Agencies also
would break up large ``umbrella,'' or multipurpose contracts that
typically include a variety of routine services, such as guards and
secretaries.
</P>
<P>
``I think a lot of people throughout government would agree with
the observation that very frequently, in government and in service
contracting, we don't do a good enough job of defining what we want
out of the contractors, what performance we want,'' said Steven
Kelman, the administrator of OMB's Office of Federal Procurement
Policy.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, a survey ordered by Panetta found that the
``statements of work'' which describe the tasks or services to be
purchased are often so imprecise that vendors are unable to determine
agency requirements. Poor statements of work can reduce the number of
bidders, limiting competition, and make it difficult to assess a
contractor's performance.
</P>
<P>
Kelman, noting that ``it's hard to write a good statement of what
you want,'' said some procurement officials developed statements of
work, then used them repeatedly without taking into account
technological changes or lessons learned from management experiences.
</P>
<P>
The pilot project, he said, will ``tighten up the system in the
sense of making it more clear, up front, what the performance criteria
is and what we want from contractors.''
</P>
<P>
By using performance-based standards, Kelman said, the government
should be able to move to fixed-price contracts, perform fewer audits
and save around 20 percent on contract costs. An ``unusually
dramatic'' example -- savings of 43 percent -- was achieved at the
Treasury Department when it took a cost-based contract for training
and coverted it to fixed price, Kelman said.

 Health-Care Turning Point (Washn) 
 Dionne is a member of The Washington Post editorial-page staff. 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The health-care debate is not nearly as complicated as
it looks. Oh yes, the details can get immensely complex -- and getting
the details wrong could cost dearly. But what's causing all the
turmoil are a few key choices. Once those choices are made, the
details begin to fall into place.
</P>
<P>
The biggest choice is whether or not the United States wants a
system assuring every American health insurance. This issue passes
under the name ``universal coverage.'' Universal coverage is immensely
popular not only among those who are uninsured but also among those
who currently have insurance but fear they will lose it or see their
coverage eroded as employers face ever-higher costs.
</P>
<P>
So popular is universal coverage that few politicians will say
they're against it. But guaranteeing everyone health coverage will
cost money. There are only so many ways to raise the money. Congress
could simply raise taxes. Or it could require individuals to pick up
the tab. Or it can require employers to pay part or most of the costs,
as so many already do now.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton's plan puts most but not all of the burden on
employers. All employers, with the exception of some of the smallest,
would have to pay 80 percent of the health insurance costs for their
employees, individuals 20 percent. That roughly matches the current
split at companies that insure their employees.
</P>
<P>
You wouldn't know it from the cowering in Congress over the dread
``employer mandate,'' as it's known, but requiring companies to insure
their employees is immensely popular. That ought not be surprising.
Most people are employees, not employers. And most people think that
if they hold down a job -- or, as is the case with so many families,
two jobs -- health coverage ought to be part of the deal.
</P>
<P>
But it is a sign of how skewed the debate is in Washington toward
various business lobbies that the employer mandate has become the main
sticking point in the discussion. Many Republicans and some
conservative Democrats say they'll kill any health bill that includes
one.
</P>
<P>
Yet most of these politicians will then turn around and also say no
to new taxes, no to individual mandates, no to anything that would
actually guarantee universal coverage. A courageous exception is Sen.
John Chafee, R-R.I., who favors requiring individuals to buy health
insurance. As Chafee noted on ``Meet the Press'' on Sunday, ``to have
universal coverage and to have the reforms that we need ... we've got
to have some kind of mandate.'' For his candor, Chafee has gotten
nothing but grief from the Republican right, which wants to use the
mandate issue to stop universal coverage.
</P>
<P>
What scares the Republicans about Chafee's position is that if they
concede the reality that only mandates or taxes lead to universality,
the Democrats who favor employer mandates suddenly have the political
high ground. Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole is very shrewd about
this. ``I can already see the 30-second television spots,'' Dole told
The Washington Post's Dana Priest. `` `Well, the Republicans didn't
want your boss to pay for it, they want you to pay for it.' '' Clinton
ought to hire Dole as a media consultant.
</P>
<P>
Some former opponents of the mandate among Democrats have begun to
understand what Dole already knows. The conversion of Sen. John
Breaux, D-La., from firm opposition to open-mindedness about an
employer mandate may be seen later as the turning point in the debate.
</P>
<P>
Opponents of large-scale reform have taken to arguing that there is
no need for a universal program now and that slower, piecemeal action
makes more sense on a problem this complicated. This view has
intuitive appeal, but may be dead wrong on health care. As Hilary
Stout and David Rogers pointed out in the Wall Street Journal last
week, the cost per person of providing coverage generally drops when
more people are covered in larger insurance pools. Piecemeal reform
could be more expensive, not less. And real cost containment is only
possible once everyone is in the system. Otherwise, the providers of
health care will keep shifting costs from the uninsured or the poorly
insured to the well insured.
</P>
<P>
The point with health reform is that you either really do it or you
don't, and the key to whether it gets done is Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Moynihan's
discomfort with the Clinton plan is often ascribed to prickly personal
relations with the White House, with Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell and the like. But instead of psychoanalyzing Moynihan,
supporters of health reform would do well to pay attention to what
he's written about social policy over the years -- for example, in his
1988 volume, ``Came the Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
Two themes are central to Moynihan's view. One is the hubris of
social reformers. Speaking of government's exertions in the 1960s,
Moynihan says that ``we should not exaggerate what we knew or what
would come of what we undertook.'' What scared Moynihan initially
about Clinton's health undertaking was his plan's complexity and the
impression some Clintonites gave that they thought they had unlocked
all the mysteries of health policy.
</P>
<P>
But Moynihan also has an immense respect for what government
 can do. ``Government,'' he says, ``can embrace great causes and do
great things.''
</P>
<P>
Clinton's central task is to convince Moynihan -- and with him the
country -- that universal health coverage as conceived by the
administration is not an act of hubris but a practical next step in a
great cause that began with Social Security and the New Deal -- and
that has worked out pretty well.

 Czech Republic Resists Trend to Put Ex-Communists Back In Power 
 (Prague) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
PRAGUE, Czech Republic
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While former Communists and Socialists in
much of Eastern Europe are riding a popular backlash against economic
reforms to return to power, the Czech Republic appears to be a notable
exception.
</P>
<P>
This country of 10.5 million people, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus
said recently, is beginning to look like ``a small non-leftist island
in the center of Europe... . All opinion polls show that nothing like
that could ever happen in our country.''
</P>
<P>
Jiri Ryvola, spokesman for the country's newly militant labor
confederation, has many criticisms of Klaus but agrees with him on one
fundamental point: Former Communists and Socialists have little chance
here of returning to power, as they have in several other formerly
Communist-governed states. ``It just seems unlikely to me that a
similar development could occur here,'' Ryvola said.
</P>
<P>
Less than five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall sent the
Communist regimes of Eastern Europe tumbling like dominoes, both
Poland and Lithuania have put former Communist parties back into
office, and Hungary is about to follow suit, with the Socialist Party
poised for a commanding victory in runoff elections there May 29.
</P>
<P>
Yet, here in the Czech Republic there is no sign that former
Communists or Socialists are gathering any momentum at all, as both
government and labor continue to support the drive to establish a
free-market economy in the shortest time possible and seem to share a
hatred for Communists, past and present.
</P>
<P>
The sharing of basic views toward the reform process between the
Czech republic's only labor confederation and its political leadership
has apparently not been shaken by a demonstration by 30,000
disgruntled workers on March 22 -- the biggest protest seen in Prague's
Old Town Square since the overthrow of the Communist regime here in
November 1989.
</P>
<P>
The Left Bloc -- Communists, Socialists and their allies -- holds 33
seats in the 200-seat parliament, second only to the 76 held by
Klaus's Civic Democratic Party. But polls show the bloc currently
attracting less than 10 percent of voters.
</P>
<P>
Why the Czech Republic is bucking the leftward trend in Eastern
Europe has become the object of considerable discussion among Western
diplomats, academics, bankers and financiers.
</P>
<P>
These analysts are pondering whether the Czech Republic could serve
as a model of successful transformation from communism to capitalism
for other Eastern European nations or whether conditions here are so
specific as to make this unlikely.
</P>
<P>
Right now, the prevailing wisdom seems to be that the Czechs,
formerly part of Czechoslovakia before it split into separate Czech
and Slovak republics in January 1993, are a special case, with a prime
minister who has devised a unique approach.
</P>
<P>
Klaus, a prominent economist, prides himself on being a disciple of
former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, a labor-bashing
free-marketeer who despised the social welfare state.
</P>
<P>
But analysts here say Klaus has in fact followed a highly statist
approach toward reform that has carefully incorporated the labor
unions as partners, relied heavily on social welfare measures to keep
the social peace and spent billions of dollars in government subsidies
 -- in flagrant violation of free-market principles.
</P>
<P>
``It's clearly hypocritical for Klaus to call himself a
Thatcherite. He's the biggest Social Democrat in Europe,'' said
Mitchell Orenstein, a Yale University graduate researching the Czech
transition at the Institute for East-West Studies here.
</P>
<P>
One of the most striking features of the Czech political scene
today is the divorce of the unions and leftist parties, while unions
in Hungary and Poland have jumped into politics and parliament with
enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the answer lies partly in how the fall of the
Communist regime came about here -- more as an aftershock of the
earthquake that swept the Communists from power elsewhere. The
transition was so peaceful that it came to be known as the Velvet
Revolution but also so brief -- a matter of a couple of weeks -- that
little real reform took place within the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the reform process in Hungary and Poland was underway
for years and affected their Communist parties as well before
non-Communists finally took power in the 1989-90 general upheaval.
They quickly shed their old names and ideologies as part of a general
face lifting to persuade voters they had broken with the past.
</P>
<P>
Here, the Communist Party is still agonizing over whether to take
``Communist'' out of its title and has failed to shake off the stigmas
attached to it. ``Eighty percent of our members voted to keep the
name,`` party Chairman Miroslav Grebenicek explained somewhat
apologetically.
</P>
<P>
Grebenicek readily agrees with Klaus and Ryvola that there is no
chance of the Communists coming back to power here in the near future.
The party, he explained, is badly fragmented, with its legislators
split into three factions.
</P>
<P>
But a weak, fragmented and only partially reformed Communist
opposition is not the sole reason former Communists and Socalists have
been marginalized here, according to Orenstein.
</P>
<P>
He believes the secret to Klaus's success lies in two strategies -- 
massive government subsidies to construct an extensive social safety
net to soften the effects of wrenching economic reforms and a
corporatist approach toward labor and business.
</P>
<P>
Klaus has relied on such non-free-market practices as a law barring
state-owned enterprises from declaring bankruptcy while they are being
privatized. Yet 61 percent of 767 industrial enterprises were
insolvent as of March 31, according to press reports.
</P>
<P>
This refusal to allow bankruptcies has meant that hundreds of
thousands of workers who would otherwise have been laid off have kept
their jobs -- a practice not followed in Hungary or Poland. This has
cost the Czech treasury billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
Klaus has also implemented a program of make-work projects to
create ``publicly useful jobs,'' such as street sweeping, to keep
another 100,000 to 140,000 employed. In addition, the government pays
out a ``living minimum'' wage to 300,000 or more Czechs classified as
being below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
These measures have allowed the government to boast that the Czech
Republic has the lowest unemployment rate -- less than 4 percent -- of
any country in Europe today.

 Bitterness in Gaza's Refugee Camps (Deir Balah Camp, Gaza Strip) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
DEIR BALAH REFUGEE CAMP, Gaza Strip
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the edge of the shimmering
waters and brilliant beaches of the Mediterranean lie 39 acres of
dreary cinder-block warrens, sandy alleys, open sewers and the dreams
of 13,680 Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Among them is Bassem Khaldi, 32, a teacher, the sole breadwinner in
a family of 24 people living in seven rooms and sharing one kitchen.
Khaldi and his wife occupy one room with a corrugated tin roof. As
much as he would like to flee this overcrowded camp, he has nowhere to
go.
</P>
<P>
``Once, I dreamed of a house and a car,'' he said. ``Our dreams are
something. Our hopes are something. But reality is different. I have
no choice. I can't leave. I am the only one working, and I have to
support 24 people.''
</P>
<P>
His predicament helps explain much about the land and people that
Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat will govern
when he takes over the Gaza Strip in the weeks ahead. Two out of three
people under Arafat's new domain are refugees from the 1948 war and
their descendants. They are the poorest of the Palestinians, those who
are most desperately in need of new housing and economic revival.
</P>
<P>
Yet they may be the most difficult to help, for reasons both
political and economic.
</P>
<P>
The Gaza refugee camps -- Beach, Jabaliyah, Khan Younis, Rafah,
Nuseirat, Bureij, Deir Balah and Maghazi -- are where the Palestinian
uprising caught fire six years ago, and where resentment and pride
still burn deep. A recent study of Palestinian society by a Norwegian
institute found that ``the single most embittered sector of the
population is the first generation'' of Palestinian men in the Gaza
refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
Here, Arafat remains a powerful figure. On a recent afternoon, the
sun-baked walls here were resplendent with a freshly painted,
elaborate Arabic graffito hailing the PLO and pledging ``All the glory
to our martyrs.'' Red and green paint ran in glistening rivulets
through the sand below.
</P>
<P>
The name Deir Balah means ``Monastery of the Dates,'' recalling an
earlier era when this was a balmy stretch of plantations. But today
the refugee camp, Gaza's smallest, is a dense honeycomb of families
surviving in identical square cinder-block cells built for them in
1960.
</P>
<P>
There is 124 square feet of living space for each of the 13,680
residents of the camp.
</P>
<P>
To an outsider looking at the Gaza coast, the refugee camps might
seem an obvious target for razing and resettlement. But starting over
with the refugees has long been problematic. For five decades, the
camps were a symbol to Palestinians of what they believed was the
temporary nature of their exodus. Israel sought to carry out a
resettlement effort in the 1970s, and several thousand refugees took
advantage of it, but there was criticism that it would mean the end of
their claims to land and villages they lost when Israel was created in
1948.
</P>
<P>
The refugees' claims are not expected to be negotiated until the
talks on the permanent status of the Gaza Strip and West Bank in
several years. At least theoretically, Arafat probably does not want
to give up any cards or leverage before those negotiations by
dismantling the camps now.
</P>
<P>
But attitudes in the camps are changing, albeit slowly. The
enormous pressures of decades of overcrowding and poverty have spurred
a steady stream of refugees to leave the camps on their own. (They
retain their status as refugees, eligible for benefits from the U.N.
Relief and Works Agency, even when they move out of the camps.) The
Gaza refugee population has grown from 200,000 in 1951 to 625,000
today, about half of them in the camps.
</P>
<P>
``In the period 1948 to 1953, for the people who were there, (the
camps were large) enough to accommodate those numbers,'' said
Palestinian lawyer Shasabeel Alzaeem, a consultant to the U.N. agency.
``But the person who back then had one bed and one kitchen, now he is
a grandfather with 10 sons. So, they cannot continue expanding. This
is why so many have left.''
</P>
<P>
``It doesn't mean they forgot Jaffa or Haifa,'' he added, referring
to towns with a large pre-1948 Arab population. ``But they understand
they cannot return to Jaffa and Haifa.''
</P>
<P>
``The old people still remember the land, the village,'' Khaldi
said. ``If you ask someone where they are from, they will never say
Deir Balah. When we register the children in our school, we still
write down the name of the original village.'' Most of those in the
camp were refugees from towns and villages along the southern coast of
Palestine, near what is now the Israeli towns of Ashdod and Ashkelon.
</P>
<P>
``But, to be honest, they don't feel they have a good chance of
going back,'' he added. ``It's not fair. But it's realistic. They have
no other choice.''
</P>
<P>
Salah Musa arrived in Deir Balah when he was 15. At first he lived
in a tent; later, in a mud-brick shanty with an asphalt roof that
leaked in winter rains. Musa became the mukhtar, or village leader, of
Deir Balah and saw his own experience multiplied. ``Most people have
been living in a crisis for a long time. The housing, the living
conditions and the economy completely deteriorated. The people are
psychologically broken.''
</P>
<P>
Smoking cigarettes and sipping sweet tea, Musa looked out his door
at the beach and camp -- a striking contrast of natural beauty and
man-made squalor. He said no one had forced him to remain here. He
simply had no alternative. ``I haven't decided to live in a refugee
camp,'' he said. ``If I find a house, a beautiful house, there is
nothing stopping me from leaving. But no one came and gave me money to
build a house, so what can I do? Tell me!''
</P>
<P>
``The situation is completely different since 1948,'' he said.
``Then, it was only me and my wife. Now, 35 people live here. I sure
don't want to live in this house -- it's crowded. I hope the
Palestinians who control this place will build me a new house.''
</P>
<P>
But practically speaking, Arafat's new government will not be in a
financial position to rebuild Deir Balah or the other camps for many
years, if at all.

 New Noise Laws May Aid Airplane Makers (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To say the pickings have been slim of late for
builders of commercial airliners would be to exaggerate.
</P>
<P>
But there may be help on the horizon because of the slowly
improving condition of the airlines and because of something called
the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990. The noise act says that
every large commercial jet in the United States has to meet quieter
``Stage 3'' noise requirements by Dec. 31, 1999, and 1,223 of the
3,335 jets in service today are in violation. Given a two- to
three-year lead time between placing an order for an aircraft and
taking delivery, the orders for aircraft are going to have to start
coming in soon, manufacturers hope.
</P>
<P>
Just as quieter planes would be a change for people living along
airport flight paths, it also would be a change for those who make the
planes.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent survey by the magazine Airline Business, the
Big Three of the commercial aircraft manufacturing world had exactly
zero net orders in 1993, with Airbus Industrie and McDonnell Douglas
Corp. actually having more cancellations than orders and Boeing having
only 33 planes on the plus side.
</P>
<P>
Altogether, Boeing's latest market forecast, released Monday,
projects the worldwide market for aircraft having between 70 and 170
seats at about 3,000 planes by the year 2000. That combines
replacement of older planes and additions to airline fleets.
</P>
<P>
That's actually down about 2 percent from last year's forecast,
according to Richard L. James, Boeing's marketing vice president, but
he says it will be more than enough to keep all three manufacturers'
lines humming, once airlines break out of the doldrums into which they
have dropped over the past two or three years. Assuming they do,
replacement of noisy planes will be part of the equation. While the
formulas are complex, Dale McDaniel of the Federal Aviation
Administration says that, in terms of total noise impact on a
community, ``you could have 10 Stage 3 operations before it would
equal one Stage 2.''
</P>
<P>
In 1990, 2.7 million people were exposed to an average of 65
decibels or higher over a 24-hour period. ``That is non-compatible
with residential use. By 2000, that will down to 400,000,'' McDaniel
said, although those in the path of those aircraft might not be happy
no matter what the noise stage classification.
</P>
<P>
The deadline ``provides some continuing stimulation. The fact that
it remains a target continues to drive (airlines) to modernize,''
McDaniel said, adding a dash of fiscal reality by noting that now the
airlines ``just have to have the funds to do it.''
</P>
<P>
The dramatic losses of the past three to four years have led almost
every major U.S. carrier and many foreign ones not only to stop
ordering new planes but also to cut back on existing orders. USAir
disclosed last week, for example, that it is delaying delivery of 40
planes and forgoing options on another 70. Yesterday, British Airways,
which still is making money, said it is placing no new orders this
year and is letting options expire on 25 Boeing planes.
</P>
<P>
``Downsizing'' has been more of a buzzword in U.S. airline planning
circles lately than growth. But smaller fleets do not mean orders for
new aircraft can be shelved forever, especially with the noise
deadlines looming. Most airlines plan purchases several years in
advance and last-minute orders often can be very expensive, especially
if the market begins to tighten up.
</P>
<P>
Boeing's James said airline balance sheets ``are coming back into
balance now. A lot of carriers are stirring and looking beyond
immediate quarter. We are at a low point in terms of orders. In 18
months to two years, the books should turn.''

 Security System Distinguishes Raccoons from Robbers (Washn)

Who would have thought a high-tech security system
developed to protect the Pentagon's nuclear arsenal would be
safeguarding a huge stockpile of blue jeans?
</P>
<P>
Thanks to ever-cheaper microchips, a rudimentary form of artificial
intelligence developed by GRC International Inc. of Vienna, Va. is
being used by Gap Inc. to keep thieves or other intruders out of its
warehouse in Edgewood, Md., which serves Gap stores from Maine to
Florida.
</P>
<P>
Given the ungainly name of ``automated assessment signal
processor'' by GRC, the device is what's known in the computing world
as a neural network -- a system that mimics the human brain's ability
to take in lots of information from the body's eyes, ears, nose and
skin but discard most of it and focus only on what's important.
</P>
<P>
And it can learn to distinguish between nuisance noise -- wind;
birds, raccoons and other small animals; rustling leaves -- and noise
that should trigger an alarm: unauthorized entry by people. It's
taught by being presented with and told to ignore simulations of
certain sounds. It can be hooked up to a variety of sensor systems -- 
microwave, radar, fiber optic -- that create electronic fences around
property. It interprets the information that those sensors are
constantly collecting.

 Flourishing Bridal Bazaar Brings Russian Women 
 To Lonely and Dissatisfied American Men (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a gray day in Red Square when Chris Ihlenfeld
dropped to one knee and proposed to a Russian woman he'd met four days
earlier. At the cobbled foot of St. Basil's onion spires, Anastasia
Fedorchoukova smiled sweetly down at the divorced computer technician
from Northern Virginia. She said yes. They married six months later,
on March 25 at the Arlington County, Va. Courthouse. Now, amid coos
and cuddles in a small apartment with a large stereo, the young couple
is living a fantasy that started with a magazine ad -- their very own
Russo-American dream.
</P>
<P>
The Ihlenfelds' union is a product of the growing mail-order bridal
bazaar that has sprouted since Soviet Communism died. With Soviet
emigration barriers dismantled, about 350 Russian women entered the
United States last year as fiancees of American men. In 1988, only 11
women came from the Soviet Union to marry Americans.
</P>
<P>
The Ihlenfelds' marriage is the first arranged through Berel and
Natasha Spivack, an American-Russian couple from Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
The Spivacks are cashing in on the lucrative business of showering
Washington with brides from Russia with love. Last July, the Spivacks
started a business called Encounters International to introduce
American men to Russian women. More than 50 Washington area men, many
of them federal employees, have come to their office and grazed
through photo albums and videotapes of about 300 Russian women.
</P>
<P>
Two couples have married, six are engaged, and others are busily
faxing letters and pictures back and forth, sifting for true and
everlasting love. About every two weeks now, another Washington area
man travels to Moscow and becomes engaged.
</P>
<P>
That heavy traffic to Russia is a new wrinkle in the Washington
dating scene, where the oversupply of single women is legendary.
Magazines and gossip columns regularly wail about the imbalance
between eligible women and men in the nation's capital. Still, the
Spivacks' male clients are shelling out $3,000 to $4,000 to search for
romance in a cold, gray city 5,000 miles away.
</P>
<P>
In several interviews, American men and Russian women involved in
the program struck remarkably compatible themes. The men said they are
sick of career-obsessed American women running to the subway in
business suits and tennis shoes. The women said American men were more
likely than Russian men to treat them as equal partners.
</P>
<P>
``I was tired of American women,'' said Ihlenfeld, 24, sitting on
his living room couch, stroking his 22-year-old wife's long, blond
hair. ``All they cared about was their work.''
</P>
<P>
According to an Encounters International flier, Russian women are
``much less materialistic'' than American women, as well as ``more
willing to follow their husband's lead'' and ``more appreciative of
men.'' They also have ``old-fashioned traditional family values that
are getting harder to find'' in America, the flier says.
</P>
<P>
On top of that, the brochure says, the ``dating scene in Russia is
almost non-existent, and a woman over 22 is considered past her prime.
Wars and alcoholism have taken their toll on eligible Russian men and
created a large number of single women... . Many beautiful Russian
women dream of having an American husband.''
</P>
<P>
There are tough requiremements for those women, who must pass
entrance interviews with the Spivacks' staff member in Moscow. Women
are accepted only if the interviewer deems them reasonably slender and
attractive, if they are 17 to about 55 years old, have one or fewer
children and speak some English.
</P>
<P>
Natasha Spivack said 600 to 800 women have applied to the service,
but only 300 have met the qualifications.
</P>
<P>
Men using the service range in age from 22 to 71, but they are
mostly in their forties, and many are divorced. There are no specific
eligibility qualifications.
</P>
<P>
``When I knew him more, I really began to love him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
The Immigration and Naturalization Service has found no particular
problems with American-Russian marriage services, spokesman Richard
Kenney said.
</P>
<P>
He said women entering the country on a ``fiancee visa'' must be
married within 90 days, and they are granted permanent resident status
after two years. ``Home free,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Some marriages between American men and Russian women make sense,
according to Harley Balzer, director of the Russian Area Studies
Program at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
Balzer said many Russian men do not consider women equal partners
in marriage. ``Even men I know who write about women's rights wouldn't
get up from the dinner table to clear the dishes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Balzer said the struggle of single women has been a common theme of
the most successful Russian movies of the last 20 years. ``You've got
this funny situation where the American man is looking for an
unliberated woman, and the Russian woman is looking for a slightly
more liberated man,'' he said.

 Going for All the Angles on Hillary 
 By William F. Powers 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Magazines, especially women's magazines, have been hot on the
Hillary Rodham Clinton story for a year and a half now, delivering not
much of interest. This week's New Yorker brings the first truly
heavyweight piece on the First Lady, but before we get to that, a few
tips on how to prepare for reading it. First, go to your local
newsstand and look at the June issues of Working Woman and the
American Spectator, which basically represent the poles of current
thinking about the First Lady. You don't have to venture beyond the
cover of either to know what lies inside. The cover of Working Woman
offers the headline ``Hillary Hangs Tough'' plus a flattering photo of
the First Lady in a sensible business suit, poised patron saint of
Uber-women everywhere.
</P>
<P>
On the American Spectator's cover, Mrs. Clinton is drawn as a
witch, malevolent and defiant as she sits astride a jet. Inside is
David Brock's version of the White House travel-office scandal of last
year, the latest installment in that magazine's crusade to show that
Hillary is the antichrist of American politics.
</P>
<P>
Is the First Lady good or evil? Ponder deeply now, for it seems to
be the question of the hour.
</P>
<P>
The last several days' photos and film footage of Jacqueline
Kennedy flawlessly doing the First Lady's job the old way have made
Mrs. Clinton's chameleonism all the more unsettling. To further
unsettle yourself about her situation, next read Leslie Bennetts's
account of an interview with an edgy, angry Hillary in the June issue
of Vanity Fair. No big news here, but Bennetts's sporadic references
to her dealings with Hillary's handlers will tell you everything you
need to know about the state of the First Lady's relations with the
press. One flack hovers nearby throughout the interview, demanding at
one point that a benign exchange on Vince Foster be retroactively
taken off the record. Bennetts declines.
</P>
<P>
What are we to make of this First Lady of a thousand faces,
overexposed in every medium in the land yet somehow still unknowable,
willfully -- and perhaps wisely -- withholding parts of herself from
inquiring minds?
</P>
<P>
Enter Connie Bruck, whose lengthy cover story in this week's New
Yorker looks to be the new yardstick by which magazine profiles of
Hillary Clinton will be measured. Titled ``Hillary the Pol,'' this
exhaustively researched piece portrays her basically as the CEO of the
Clinton political partnership, the shrewd operator who resurrected his
(and their) career after he lost the Arkansas governorship in 1980,
and who in many ways still guides it today. It's the Hillary you may
have believed was there all along, behind the multiple facades:
hyper-intelligent, opportunistic, relentless in pursuit of her own
political agenda.
</P>
<P>
Bruck traces the First Lady's political skills back to Arkansas. In
one instance, she describes how, after Bill's gubernatorial defeat,
Hillary set out to neutralize an Arkansas newspaper columnist who had
been an antagonist of Bill's. Hillary wined and dined the man, and he
left Clinton alone for years. There are many other such stories, but
the message is always the same: She had her idealistic vision for
improving the world, but she also did what it took to reach short-term
goals along the way, whether they were political, legislative or
financial.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Clinton didn't have time to be interviewed for the piece, we
learn, but the president was able to give Bruck nearly two hours. What
does that tell you?
</P>
<P>
At one point Bruck raises the possibility that Hillary might even
seek to succeed Bill in his current job: ``Some friends have suggested
that her goal now may well be to become president herself,'' Bruck
writes. ``Betsey Wright (Governor Bill Clinton's chief of staff) told
me last December, ``There are a great many people talking very
seriously about her succeeding him. Their staff will say, ``We have to
do it this way and that way, and then we'll be here at least twelve
years.'' And it's not just the staff. Friends, Democrats, people out
across the country think it is a very viable plan of action.' ''
</P>
<P>
Since The New Yorker came out Sunday, Wright has denied saying
that, but The New Yorker is standing by the story.
</P>
<P>
In Bruck's account of Clinton's health care reform task force, the
portrait's especially severe; the First Lady seems so certain of her
own correctness that she will brook no criticism.
</P>
<P>
``In the end, that sureness about her own judgment -- at its
extreme, a sense that she alone is wise -- is probably Hillary's
cardinal trait,'' Bruck writes.
</P>
<P>
The Jackie model of how to be the president's wife died with her.
Maybe what we see in Bruck's piece are the outlines of a new First
Lady paradigm that, for better or worse, we'd better start getting
used to.

 An Old Master, as Good as New (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andrew W. Mellon was exceptionally rich, and the
Soviet Union broke, when, in the spring of 1930, Mellon bought a
500-year-old painting -- for $500,000 -- right out of the Hermitage. For
an additional $6,154,000 he soon got 20 others, by Raphael and
Rembrandt, Titian and van Dyck, Chardin and Velazquez, but none
gratified him more than the first, a panel from an altarpiece by the
early Netherlandish master Jan van Eyck of Bruges.
</P>
<P>
Its condition was deplorable, its companion panels lost, its scale
unexceptional. Van Eyck's ``Annunciation'' (c. 1434/1436) is less than
15 inches wide. Still, the purchaser believed, and not without good
reason, that he had bought a monument of European art.
</P>
<P>
For more than 50 years, that narrow, beat-up painting would be
displayed in the museum Mellon gave his country, the National Gallery
of Art here. Then it was taken down. This week, after two years in the
lab -- two years of careful cleaning, high-tech examination and
painstaking repair -- it goes on view again.
</P>
<P>
The picture seems reborn, though it will never again look just as
van Eyck made it. Still, its dull varnish is gone, its bold blues have
their brightness back, and its many missing paint flecks -- there were
hundreds, maybe thousands -- have been seamlessly filled in. The
picture's conservation was primarily conducted by the gallery's David
Bull, a former museum director (he used to run the Norton Simon in
Pasadena, Calif.) who has a scholar's eye and a sure, rock-steady
hand. Look as closely as you wish at the in-painting he's done, and
try to find a flaw.
</P>
<P>
Gabriel, the archangel, smiling with delight, has just appeared to
Mary to announce the Incarnation. His angelic salutation, Ave gratia
plena (``Hail, full of grace'') -- the letters writ in gold -- floats
out of his mouth like a holy exhalation. The scepter that he holds is
of rock crystal, not glass. Van Eyck was a magician. What one cannot
quite believe is the physicality of his sight.
</P>
<P>
The capitals that crown the columns in the picture have been carved
so finely -- with interweaving tendrils, complex Celtic strapwork, with
warriors and with steeds -- that you feel each chisel mark. Gabriel's
garments, too, are endowed with such tactility that you somehow know
the softness of their velvets, the stiff weight of their threads of
gold, the slightly gritty gleamings of their countless sewn-on pearls.
</P>
<P>
Even from an inch away, van Eyck's surfaces don't fall apart into
streaks of paint. His manner has uncanny depth; his details on details
go on and on and on.
</P>
<P>
``He knew fabrics like the weaver, from whose looms they have
flowed,'' wrote the scholar Max J. Friedlander, ``buildings like an
architect, the earth like a geographer, plants like a botanist.''
</P>
<P>
``From the sheer sensuous beauty of a genuine Jan van Eyck,''
agreed Erwin Panofsky, the Princeton iconographer, ``there emanates a
strange fascination not unlike that which we experience when we permit
ourselves to be hypnotized by precious stones or when looking into
deep water.''

 `Beverly Hills Cop III' Banking on Star Power (Hollywood) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
HOLLYWOOD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was a memorable moment in ``Beverly Hills Cop''
when Eddie Murphy's Axel Foley jammed a banana in a parked police
car's tailpipe.
</P>
<P>
Walking out of ``Beverly Hills Cop III,'' you may be moved to ask,
``Anybody have a banana for this movie?''
</P>
<P>
The existence of this film is a testament to star power -- or, to be
more precise, recycling power. We're supposed to be so grateful to
once again see Eddie Murphy as Axel that we can overlook how crude and
shopworn this picture really is. It's one of the most cynically
engineered sequels ever.
</P>
<P>
The kicky appeal of the ``Cop'' series -- at least potentially -- has
always been the idea of a street-smart black cop from Detroit who
outmaneuvers the (mostly) white Beverly Hills honchos who
underestimate him. It's a neat racial joke that provided a few
chuckles in ``Beverly Hills Cop'' and virtually none in its
hyper-powered, Stallone-ish sequel.
</P>
<P>
Stallone, in fact, was originally supposed to star in ``Beverly
Hills Cop,'' and the series has never gotten very far from his
over-muscled shadow. For most of the way in ``Beverly Hills Cop III''
(MPAA rated R) we might as well be watching any old standard-issue
action hunk dodging bullets and lobbing grenades (and, in a
masterstroke, saving children in peril). But Murphy gives us less than
those action hunks do; he's playing out his own fantasy image of a
righteous avenger, and the fantasy is essentially humorless. There's
little trace of his gift for con-man mimicry. It's as if he set out to
trash his own franchise.
</P>
<P>
Once again Axel, wearing his Detroit Lions jacket, is brought back
to Beverly Hills from Detroit to track down the killers of a close
associate. And once again he gets propelled into shootouts and car
chases with a clan of murderous nasties, headed by John Saxon and
Timothy Carhart. Their base of operations is a theme park called
WonderWorld, which -- how'd you guess? -- features a dinosaur ride.
``Jurassic Cop,'' anyone?
</P>
<P>
The Beverly Hills police force retains series regular Judge
Reinhold, who now has his own office and his own SWAT team. Bronson
Pinchot also turns up again as the oddly accented Serge. He has
graduated from an art gallery to a boutique selling personalized
luxury weapons, which is a fair way of gauging how far the inspiration
in this series has dropped.
</P>
<P>
At a time when police detective shows on television are better than
they ever have been, what excuse is there for the slovenliness of
``Beverly Hills Cop III''? Director John Landis and screenwriter
Steven E. de Souza (who worked on ``48 HRS.'' and the ``Die Hard''
films) are strictly smash-and-grab guys. Like the other films in the
series, this one has no muscle tone; it wobbles opportunistically
between wan slapstick and routine bang bang, with lots of gratuitous
cheesecake for scenery.
</P>
<P>
It's not easy to make audiences laugh at a comedy where characters
are actually shot on camera. And, in the post-Rodney G. King era, a
racially tinged film involving cops and violence in Los Angeles
carries a lot of unwanted baggage.
</P>
<P>
Taken simply as pure action, the mayhem in this movie may be
routine but, in the context of a knockabout comedy it's deeply
offensive. The film begins with a bunch of workmen in a Detroit auto
shop shimmying to a record by the Supremes. The scene is played for
broad, dumb laughs; then, in a scene that's not played for laughs,
they get bloodily ventilated.
</P>
<P>
But it's near the end, when the assorted good guys wobble and
collapse into frame with their wounds, that the corruption of this
enterprise sinks in.
</P>
<P>
There's a fundamental lack of human feeling in ``Beverly Hills Cop
III'' that makes you want to avert your eyes from the people around
you when the lights come up. Attending this movie makes you feel like
an accomplice to the corruption.

 `Buddha': Terminal Bliss (Hollywood) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
HOLLYWOOD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the editor of Tricycle, the Buddhist Review, one
of the few journalists allowed on the set of ``Little Buddha,'' the
new Bernardo Bertolucci film, wrote about her experience, one question
continued to trouble her. What was the word ``Little'' doing in the
title?
</P>
<P>
None of the filmmakers, it turned out, could give her a
satisfactory answer, but now that the picture itself is here, the
reason seems obvious. Despite its illustrious pedigree, ``Little
Buddha'' turns out to have the sensibility of a children's film, the
most elaborate and expensive ``Afterschool Special'' ever to make it
to the big screen.
</P>
<P>
Being a children's film, of course, is not necessarily a negative
thing, and aspects of ``Little Buddha'' (MPAA rating: PG) do linger
pleasantly in the memory. But what lingers as well is the suspicion
that this is a children's film at least partly by default, the product
of too much goofy New Age reverence and too little nuance and
sophistication.
</P>
<P>
Those who remember such Bertolucci films as ``The Conformist'' and
``Last Tango in Paris'' may be surprised at this turn in his career,
but those pictures are deep in the director's past. More recently
we've seen the likes of ``The Last Emperor,'' which, its many Oscars
notwithstanding, is best remembered for how everything looked, not for
what anyone said.
</P>
<P>
In fact, especially when, as here, Bertolucci collaborates with
Vittorio Storaro, one of the world's preeminent cinematographers, the
director has a tendency to become a prisoner of his own particular
gift for luscious images, to assume that the dramatic side of things
will more or less take care of itself.
</P>
<P>
Story, however, can be neglected only at great risk, especially
when two parallel tales are being told. The first begins in a Tibetan
Buddhist monastery in modern-day Bhutan, where Lama Norbu (Chinese
actor Ying Ruocheng) gets a telegram he's been waiting for for nine
years, a message that soon puts him on a jet headed for Seattle.
</P>
<P>
Though all Buddhists believe in reincarnation, only Tibetan
Buddhists believe that specific people, invariably great teachers, can
be identified in their next incarnation. And Lama Norbu has reason to
believe that his own teacher, admittedly a man with a hell of a sense
of humor, has been reincarnated as an 8-year-old American named Jesse
Konrad (newcomer Alex Wiesendanger).
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly nonplussed by this news are Jesse's parents, Lisa
(Bridget Fonda) and Dean (singer Chris Isaak), a sprightly young
couple who don't quite know what to make of all these robed and shaven
monks appearing suddenly in their lives.
</P>
<P>
They don't object, however, when Lama Norbu gives Jesse a child's
life of the Buddha. This little book forms the basis of ``Little
Buddha's'' second narrative strand, a film-within-a-film set in Asia
2,500 years ago that details how the fun-loving Prince Siddhartha
transformed himself into a great spiritual being.
</P>
<P>
Though it plays at times like an infomercial on Eastern religions,
this half of ``Little Buddha'' is the most successful. For one thing,
this is where Storaro's photography and James Acheson's production and
costume design are at their best, making good use of the
never-before-seen streets of Bhutan and creating opulent set pieces.
</P>
<P>
And though eyebrows and even entire faces were raised when it was
announced that Keanu Reeves was going to play Siddhartha, in fact, he
does what the part calls for as the golden youth shielded from misery
and death who takes the path to enlightenment. Hewing closely to
traditional texts, this part of ``Little Buddha'' comes off closest to
the fable quality the filmmakers were apparently after.
</P>
<P>
In the modern half, however, the lack of texture that is the film's
weakest link is most evident. The Mark Peploe and Rudy Wurlitzer plot,
from a story by the director, seems determined to take the drama out
of every situation, while the accompanying dialogue is invariably
hollow and unconvincing.
</P>
<P>
Being blissed out may be an enviable state for a human being, but
it is not necessary the best one for a film.

 `Buddha' Is Uneven, but Bertolucci's Direction Is Magical 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bernardo Bertolucci may not know anything more about Eastern
religion than I do, but I don't care. This is not to say his ``Little
Buddha'' is inaccurate, either in its portrayal of Tibetan Buddhist
thought or the life of Siddhartha (Keanu Reeves), only that it doesn't
really matter. What matters is what happens on screen, and
Bertolucci's direction alone is the stuff of religious conversion.
</P>
<P>
The director, whose philosophical questing has taken him to China
and North Africa in recent years (for ``The Last Emperor'' and ``The
Sheltering Sky'') has filmed his latest in the holy lands of Nepal,
Bhutan and Seattle. And in telling his based-on-real-life story -- 
about a blond 9-year-old who is suspected of being a reincarnated lama
 -- and juxtaposing it with an epic recounting of the life of Prince
Siddhartha -- who will become the Buddha -- Bertolucci reverses the
tired conventions about ancient religions and religious life and in
the process evokes a very contemporary yearning for spirituality.
</P>
<P>
That he cannot sustain the tone of serene momentum that opens the
film is perhaps inevitable; once the seduction of the viewer is
accomplished there's a certain leveling-off of passion. But the
beginning of ``Little Buddha'' has moments so full of magic it's
surprising how much of it is accomplished through simple humor.
</P>
<P>
The Buddhist temple in Bhutan, where the film opens, is not the
forbidding place of popular imagination. It is a center of learning,
of warmth and of children instructed by Lama Norbu (Ying Ruocheng),
who invites questions and makes jokes. His beatific demeanor changes
only after he gets a letter saying that the reincarnated spirit of his
late teacher, Lama Norje, has been located. In Seattle.
</P>
<P>
``Lama Norje had a great sense of humor,'' says Kenpo Tensin
(Sogyal Rinpoche), one of the jolly monks who have determined that
blond, Gameboy-playing Jesse Conrad (Alex Wiesendanger) has been
chosen by Norje for his reappearance. Jesse likes the idea, likes the
gentle Lama Norbu, and gives signs that he may actually be Lama Norje.
But it's no joke to his parents (Bridget Fonda and Chris Isaak), who
have made no provision in their yuppie life-plan for a Buddhist
invasion.
</P>
<P>
Where ``Little Buddha'' falters, and it does, lies in the casting.
As Jesse's fatherInvalid face , Dean, who takes Jesse to Bhutan, Isaak
has the unformed face and personality to make him truly American, and
truly flat. Likewise Reeves, whose lighter-than-air screen presence is
appropriate for the young, naive Prince Siddhartha, but who in the end
doesn't provide anything very substantial.
</P>
<P>
The ancient Indian sequences are full of miracles, outlandish
visuals and ornate religion, but the modern world defines the film's
spiritual impact. Bertolucci says that godhead isn't about myth and
trappings, but about yearning -- as defined by the faith of monks, or
perhaps the unfilled need of secular Americans. ``Little Buddha,'' in
its gentle way, probes that cavity.

 Third `Beverly Hills Cop' Not Eddie Murphy's Comeback Film 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eddie Murphy has been telling interviewers, in no uncertain terms,
that ``Beverly Hills Cop III'' is not his comeback film. And he's
right.
</P>
<P>
A strictly paint-by-numbers, action-adventure yarn, with little
sense of humor and even less sense of purpose, ``Beverly Hills Cop
III'' effectively nullifies Murphy's main asset -- comedy -- in favor of
making him another Sylvester Stallone. Which is not something we
desperately need.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, it defuses the whole dramatic premise behind the
first two ``Beverly Hills Cop'' movies (the first of which was vastly
superior to the others), which was Axel Foley as bureaucratic victim -- 
a streetwise Detroit detective, a cop out of water, defying the
uptight, rulebook-bound Beverly Hills police to fight the good fight.
He was smarter than your average underdog. Now, he just seems rude.
</P>
<P>
When Axel gets to Beverly Hills this time around, he's chasing a
gang of cop killers who eluded him in Detroit after an opening
shootout that's a good example of both false advertising -- the
action's never this hot again -- and director John Landis' debauched
way with movie violence. Bullets and blood are sprayed with equal
abandon, cars and humans are liberally riddled, and each slug ends its
trajectory target with a fat, soft thud. Much like the jokes. The
Secret Service doesn't want the gang caught; they're up to uncovering
something much bigger, apparently, than the killing of Detroit cops.
Axel is unmoved, not caring who or what he demolishes en route to
getting what he wants. He's like a cop with a multipicture deal.
</P>
<P>
The pursuit takes him to WonderWorld, a Disneyland knockoff
inspired by the Walt-like Uncle Dave (Alan Young) and under the de
facto control of Ellis DeWald (Timothy Carhart), the ruthless killer
Foley is chasing. That this one deliciously perverse aspect of ``BHC
III'' is not exploited for anything close to its subversive potential
is symptomatic of the movie's failings. Disney-facists vs. the state.
It could have been great.
</P>
<P>
But ``Beverly Hills Cop III'' lumbers on its way to a predictable,
and predictably violent, conclusion, with Axel's BH buddy Billy
Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) consistently befuddled, Detective Flint
(Hector Elizondo) trying to protect his post-retirement job at
WonderWorld, Bronson Pinchot reprising the unpronounceable Serge,
who's now in the personal security business, and some shamelessly
cheesy action sequences. Theresa Randle, as the WonderWorld worker
sympathetic to Axel's cause, is really the sole cast member worth
watching.
</P>
<P>
Whether ``BHC III'' signifies anything in terms of Murphy's career
is moot; the actor hasn't had anywhere to come back from, not if
you're talking box office. Even when he's turned out incendiary
devices like ``Harlem Nights'' or ``Boomerang'' he's made money.
Artistically, of course, it's another story. He hasn't really
fulfilled his comedic potential since ... well, maybe the original
``Beverly Hills Cop.'' But it clearly doesn't bother him. If Eddie
Murphy felt he had anything to prove, he wouldn't have done Part III
of a movie series that had already run out of gas, wouldn't have
hooked up with as lame a director as Landis, and certainly would have
read Stephen de Souza's script (you don't think he actually read this
script ... ?)

 Russia to Join NATO's Partnership for Peace (Brussels) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BRUSSELS, Belgium
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev declared
Tuesday his country would join NATO's Partnership for Peace but
emphasized that the terms of Russia's participation still need to be
clarified.
</P>
<P>
Resolving some of the recent ambiguity about the Russian
government's relations with the Atlantic alliance, Grachev said after
meeting with NATO defense ministers that Russia would definitely join
the military-cooperation program, which is designed to create a new
security system for Europe with NATO as its foundation.
</P>
<P>
``Boris Yeltsin, our president, has instructed me to make it clear
that Russia will join the Partnership for Peace program,'' Grachev
said. ``We are not going to set forth any conditions,'' he said, but
he noted that ``these framework agreements do not fully set forth the
principles and the forms of the cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
Grachev said Russia would like to sign a parallel document with the
Western allies that spells out the nature of Russia's collaboration
and the defense of its vital interests. He said he would provide
details Wednesday after meeting again earlier that day with Defense
Secretary William J. Perry and other NATO ministers.
</P>
<P>
Grachev said that after the two documents were complete, he or
Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev would be prepared to visit NATO
headquarters ``to sign the two documents, that is, the doctrine of
Partnership for Peace and our document on the collaboration of
Russia.''
</P>
<P>
During the 90-minute session, Grachev spent most of his time
elaborating on Russia's new military doctrine. He said Russia was not
opposed to joining NATO in peacekeeping missions. Later, he told
reporters that Russia would only resort to nuclear weapons when faced
with aggression from another nuclear power or one in coalition with an
enemy.
</P>
<P>
Senior administration officials described the meeting as ``friendly
and non-confrontational.'' They said there was none of the bombast or
harsh rhetoric that had been feared before Grachev's arrival at the
headquarters of an alliance created 45 years ago to contain Soviet
expansionism.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. officials sounded a note of caution, saying they wanted to
hear the specifics of the proposal Grachev promised to lay before the
ministers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
For months, the Russians have sent confused signals about their
intentions of cooperating with NATO. After indicating early on that
Moscow would join the Partnership for Peace, Yeltsin appeared to bow
to demands from the military hierarchy that NATO must recognize
Russia's role as a major power in Europe by granting it special
status.
</P>
<P>
But NATO Deputy Secretary General Sergio Balanzino said after a
meeting of the alliance's defense ministers earlier in the day that
there could be no question of drawing up a formal separate agreement
for the Russians.
</P>
<P>
``There will be no special protocol for Russia as a member of
Partnership for Peace. All members must follow the same rules,'' Perry
said.
</P>
<P>
Western defense officials have tried to reassure the Russians they
will be accorded all of the importance warranted by their country and
its special place in Europe. But by insisting that all partners must
play by the same rules, they are trying to relieve fears among East
Europeans that they will again fall under Russian military domination.
</P>
<P>
The Partnership for Peace is a kind of junior varsity team for NATO
 -- an arrangement that seeks to include East European states in
security discussions but does not give them full membership in the
alliance.
</P>
<P>
The concept emerged as an alternative to granting former Soviet
satellites immediate membership in NATO. Some ranking U.S. officials
said admitting Poland, Hungary and other former Soviet satellites into
the alliance would offend Russian sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
After expressing some dismay for what they perceived as
second-class status, 18 states from Eastern Europe and parts of the
former Soviet Union have signed up for the Partnership for Peace since
NATO heads of government launched the project at a summit here last
January.
</P>
<P>
NATO countries and their eastern partners are planning to conduct
joint military exercises this fall in Poland and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Seeking to reassure Moscow that the partnership was in no way
targeted against them, Perry urged the Russians to climb aboard what
he called ``a fast-moving train'' that is rapidly gathering momentum.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that NATO is eager to take advantage of Russia's
military power through peacekeeping initiatives that he expects will
become part of the Partnership for Peace program.
</P>
<P>
``In terms of the number of troops they have, in terms of the
quality of troops, training and equipment they have, it would be a
real asset to the Partnership for Peace were they to join it,'' Perry
said.

 Federal Thrift Plan Grows (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most of the people working for the federal government,
from Clinton appointees to long-time civil servants, are saving for a
rainy day, house purchase, college or retirement by putting
tax-deferred dollars into their thrift savings plan.
</P>
<P>
The rapid growth of the plan during its first seven years has made
federal and postal workers some of the biggest players in the stock
and bond markets.
</P>
<P>
The thrift savings plan, Uncle Sam's version of the 401 (k) plan
available to many private sector workers, could make many steady
investors millionaires by the time they are ready to retire.
</P>
<P>
Some high-income employees who joined at the beginning and made
maximum contributions to the higher risk stock and bond funds now have
accounts worth more than $100,000. Higher-income workers who made the
maximum contributions to the higher risk stock or bond funds now have
accounts worth well over $100,000.
</P>
<P>
Slighty more than 1.5 million of 2.6 million eligible employees
have invested in the stock, bond or Treasury funds. Workers in the new
Federal Employees Retirement System can contribute up to 10 percent of
pay (to the $9,240 limit) and get a matching 5 percent goverment
contribution. Those in the old Civil Service Retirement System, mostly
people hired before 1983, can contribute 5 percent of salary.
</P>
<P>
The savings plan has three funds: The G-fund, made up of short-term
risk-free U.S. Treasury securities not available to the general
public, returned 6.06 percent over the 12 month period ending in
April. In 1993 it paid 6.14 percent. In 1992, 7.23 percent; 1991, 8.15
percent; 1990, 8.90 percent and in 1989 it was 8.81 percent.
</P>
<P>
The C-fund (invested in a stock index fund that tracks all of the
stocks in the S P 500 Index) paid 5.33 percent over the past 12
months; 10.13 percent last year, 7.70 percent in 1992; 30.77 percent
in 1991; lost 3.15 percent in 1990 and paid 31.03 percent in 1989.
</P>
<P>
The F-fund paid .74 percent over the most recent 12 month period;
9.52 percent last year; 7.20 percent in 1992; 15.75 percent in 1991;
8.00 percent in 1990 and 13.89 percent in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Workers can contibute a percentage of pay or a dollar amount. In
the new book ``Your Thrift Savings Plan,'' author James Sullivan says,
``If you designate a percentage of pay deduction the dollar amount you
contribute to the TSP each pay period will automatically increase when
your pay increases. For example if you are currently earning $1,000
per pay period and designate 5 percent ... your deductions will be $50
per pay period. If your pay increases to $1,060 per pay period your
TSP deduction will automatically adjust to $53 every pay period.
Similarly, if you change job locations and fall under a different
locality pay schedule, your TSP contributions automatically increase
or decrease to reflect your new pay.''
</P>
<P>
Designating a dollar amount, however, means a worker whose pay
increases regularly will still be making contributions to the thrift
savings plan as if he or she had never received a raise. Sullivan's
how-to-invest book costs $14.95 plus $2 shipping and handling and can
be obtained c/o Federal Employees News Digest, P.O. Box 98123,

 Jericho Sealed Off So Palestinian Police Can Organize (Jerusalem) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Israel sealed off the West Bank town of Jericho Tuesday
to give Palestinian police more time to organize themselves after two
armed Jewish settlers were mistakenly detained by police who also
temporarily confiscated their weapons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestine Liberation Chairman Yasser Arafat published a
notice in Arabic newspapers here declaring that in the areas of the
Gaza Strip and Jericho that recently were transferred to Palestinian
control, he has reinstated all laws in effect prior to the 1967
Arab-Israeli war.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's move was seen here as an attempt to unilaterally cancel
the body of regulations issued since 1967 by Israel's military
occupation authorities, and Israel said his announcement violated the
Gaza-Jericho self-rule accord.
</P>
<P>
The closing of Jericho, for one day, was another sign of the
uncertainty and confusion surrounding the deployment over the last two
weeks of 3,244 Palestinian fighters from Egypt, Iraq, Sudan and Jordan
as police in the newly autonomous zones of the Gaza Strip and Jericho.
</P>
<P>
The new police, most of whom do not speak English or Hebrew, have
had difficulty communicating at tense moments of confrontation with
Israeli Jews who do not speak Arabic, and there has been confusion
over terms of the agreement under which they are operating.
</P>
<P>
In a visit to the Gaza Strip Tuesday, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
expressed sympathy for the early start-up problems, saying most of the
police had not been in the West Bank or Gaza for 27 years and need
more time to get familiar with the area under their control.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinian police have been at odds over whether
Jewish settlers should be allowed to carry weapons in the Jericho
self-rule zone. The settlers and the Israeli army say the settlers
fall under Israel's jurisdiction and may continue to carry guns.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinian police, who are armed with Kalashnikov assault
rifles, have repeatedly insisted that the settlers not carry guns when
moving about the Jericho self-rule zone, away from the Jewish
settlements.
</P>
<P>
Except for those working with the Israeli security service,
Palestinians are not permitted to carry weapons in the rest of the
West Bank, which is still under Israeli military occupation, or in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
In the latest Jericho incident, two Jews from the nearby settlement
of Naama were in a money-changer's shop in Jericho when they were
approached by a Palestinian policeman. One of the settlers, Yair
Yosef, told reporters the policeman cocked his rifle when the two
refused to hand over their sidearms, so they acceded. The two were
taken into custody and later released, and were permitted to recover
their weapons at a joint Israeli-Palestinian security office.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian police commander later said the incident was a
misunderstanding. The army announced that the town was being sealed
off for 24 hours -- barring entry to all outsiders -- to give the
Palestinians more time to explain the rules to the rank and file.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, in his announcement, appeared to be seeking to assert his
authority in Gaza and Jericho. He issued the notice, dated May 20,
from Tunis and signed it as head of the Palestinian Authority and the
PLO's executive committee.
</P>
<P>
The notice announced reinstatement of ``all the regulations, laws
and orders'' that were in effect before the June 1967 war in which
Israel captured the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Arafat said the prewar
laws would remain in effect until differing West Bank and Gaza legal
systems could be merged. Before the Israeli occupation, Jordanian law
was applied in the West Bank and Egyptian law in Gaza. Both also have
remnants of British mandate law from the post-World War I era and
earlier Turkish law from the period of Ottoman rule.
</P>
<P>
Arafat ordered Palestinian civil and religious courts to continue
working, as well as judges and prosecutors. Palestinians say most of
their civil courts in Gaza have been moribund since the the intifada ,
the Arab uprising against Israeli occupation, began 6½ years ago,
because they had no authority to enforce decisions. Judges and
prosecutors remained, however, and the courts were paid for by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's order appeared aimed at canceling the 1,300 Israeli
military orders issued during 27 years of occupation, although it did
not directly mention them. The Israeli orders, enforced through a
separate system of military courts, have long been a hated symbol of
the occupation, governing every aspect of Palestinian life, from auto
registration to a web of security restrictions.

 Rocky Flats Workers Warned on Radiation Exposure (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Department of Energy is warning hundreds of
current and former workers at the Rocky Flats nuclear-weapons complex
in Colorado that they were exposed to higher levels of neutron
radiation from 1953 to 1967 than they previously had been told,
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Medical examinations are being offered to the workers and ``dose
reconstruction'' research has begun to determine accurate levels of
exposure for workers who were either improperly monitored or not
monitored at all.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary findings already have shown that neutron-sensitive film
used in the employees' radiation-monitoring badges had been read
incorrectly, resulting in underestimations of exposure, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
DOE officials said they are notifying about 140 current Rocky Flats
employees and soon will begin contacting ``a few hundred'' former
employees, out of a total of as many as 3,000 workers exposed to
radiation from 1953, when the plant became operational, until 1967,
when monitoring procedures were tightened.
</P>
<P>
Mark N. Silverman, manager of DOE's Rocky Flats field office, said
the margins of error found so far have been modest. In the worst case,
he said, a worker's radiation dose was raised by 1 rem -- about 20
percent of the annual allowable rate of occupational exposure to
ionizing radiation.
</P>
<P>
``So far, the results are encouraging, although that doesn't make
the employees feel any better. Understandably, some of them are
asking, `How can we trust you at all?' '' Silverman said.
</P>
<P>
He said that although some Rocky Flats workers in the past have
blamed their cancers and other illnesses on radiation exposure at the
plant, none of the workers involved in the current study has reported
any symptoms.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the survey was prompted by concerns raised by
researchers conducting a routine review of Rocky Flats radiation-dose
records for DOE's office of environment, safety and health. The
department said surveys of monitoring practices will be conducted at
other DOE nuclear sites and made public as part of Energy Secretary
Hazel R. O'Leary's campaign of openness about radiation experiments
and accidents from the mid-1940s through the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Although officials said no illness or other adverse effects have
been linked yet to the underestimations of radiation exposure at Rocky
Flats, current employees are being given the option of being moved
away from exposure areas until their cumulative doses can be
re-evaluated.
</P>
<P>
``We're not going to be able to change (a worker's previous
exposure). The difference is that he at least will know,'' said Mark
Spears, manager of health and safety for the DOE plant's operating
contractor, EG G Rocky Flats Corp.
</P>
<P>
During the period under review, the facility was operated for the
Atomic Energy Commission by Dow Chemical Corp. Spears said the
dose-reconstruction process involves interviews with current and
former workers, physical examinations and the taking of bio-assay
samples to determine neutron-radiation counts in various parts of the
body.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, all available records from a worker's
production department during his period of employment are being
studied to estimate approximate levels of exposure to neutron
radiation, which can penetrate some kinds of shielding normally used
to protect workers from other forms of radiation.
</P>
<P>
Officials said much of the exposure at Rocky Flats occurred in one
building used for the chemical processing of plutonium into
weapons-grade material. The plant is no longer producing nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Spears said that a key part of the dose-reconstruction procedure
has been the retrieval of neutron-sensitive film strips from a federal
records center in Denver, where over 95,000 pieces of film used in
monitoring radiation are stored.
</P>
<P>
He said a sample of 400 strips had been re-evaluated, leading to
the discovery last February that monitoring badges worn by Rocky Flats
workers from 1953 to 1967 had been incorrectly ``read'' in manual
inspections by safety technicians.
</P>
<P>
The film strip badges were replaced in 1970 with thermoluminescent
dosimeters, which are crystal chips that can be read by computers and,
consequently, are more accurate. David Rush, a member of the task
force on health risks of nuclear-weapons production of the Physicians
for Social Responsibility, said that despite the DOE's openness
campaign, studies of radiation dosages of plant workers remain
``fragmentary'' and outdated.
</P>
<P>
``Some of the dirtiest plants are the least monitored. There are
enormous gaps in research,'' said Rush, an epidemiologist at Tufts
University. He is the coauthor of a recent book, ``Dead Reckoning,''
that estimated that DOE had radiation-dosage data on only 140,000 of
the estimated 600,000 people who have been employed at nuclear-weapons
plants.

   Here is an early look at the stories the Los Angeles Times is
considering for its first-edition Page 1 for Wednesday:

   SAFRICA-TIMES -- CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- On a crisp day of pomp
and pageantry, President Nelson Mandela outlines a soaring vision for
the new South Africa in his first state-of-the-nation speech, a
carefully crafted address that tries to meet the needs of poor blacks
without raising the fears of rich whites. The nationally televised
speech sets a formal course for the new democracy as it struggles to
shed the gaping financial and social inequities of apartheid. The
overarching goal is a ``people-centered society'' that aims to achieve
``freedom from want, freedom from hunger, freedom from deprivation,
freedom from ignorance, freedom from suppression and freedom from
fear,'' Mandela says. By Bob Drogin.

   HAITI-TIMES -- JACMEL, Haiti -- As a result of the sieve-like U.N.
blockade and a U.S. policy not to use deadly force, diplomats and
other experts say, the quiet port of Jacmel receives upwards of 40
percent of the estimated four million gallons of gasoline being
smuggled into Haiti, most from the neighboring Dominican Republic, but
with some brought from Jamaica and even Colombia. One day this past
weekend, nine tanker trucks lined up to offload fuel for the capital
of Port-au-Prince, where it is sold on the streets for about $10 a
gallon. Most of the smuggling, diplomats and Haitian businessmen say,
is controlled by Gerard Caroli, a close associate of Lt. Col. Michel
Francois, the Port-au-Prince police chief and, along with Gen. Raoul
Cedras, one of the two most powerful Haitian military leaders. By
Kenneth Freed.

   BOMBPLOT-TIMES -- NEW YORK -- Shouting their defiance, four Islamic
militants are sentenced to life in prison without parole in the
bombing of the World Trade Center. In imposing punishment for what the
government has termed ``the worst act of terrorism in U.S. history,''
federal Judge Kevin Duffy calls the defendants ``cowards'' and
admonishes them: ``What you sought to do in the name of Islam ...
violated the laws of man.'' Three of the four may be summoned as
witnesses in a larger bombing conspiracy trial of an Egyptian sheik
and a dozen other people next fall. By Robert L. Jackson.

   DENNYS -- WASHINGTON -- U.S. law enforcement officials and civil
rights advocates hail a record $46 million racial discrimination
settlement with the Denny's restaurant chain, saying it signals a new
era of cooperation in weeding out racism in public accommodations. It
settles class-action lawsuits that evoked a modern version of the
lunch-counter protests of the civil rights movement's early days. The
deal ends a painful chapter for Flagstar Cos., the chain's owner,
which was accused of fostering a discriminatory corporate culture and
refusing to serve blacks. By Jeff Leeds.

 Arafat Abrogates Israeli Laws in Gaza Strip, Jericho (Jericho) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
JERICHO, West Bank
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine
Liberation Organization and head of the Palestinians' interim
government, Tuesday canceled most of the military orders issued by
Israel over its 27-year occupation of the Gaza Strip and this West
Bank town.
</P>
<P>
In a move that asserted Palestinian authority in the two regions
and promised to affect everything from retail sales to taxation and
from traffic regulations to street crime, Arafat restored all the laws
in force prior to the 1967 Middle East War and Israel's capture of
Gaza and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Although Israeli officials questioned Arafat's authority in issuing
so sweeping an order and asserted that he needs their approval for all
legislative actions, Palestinians hailed the move as another step in
their liberation.
</P>
<P>
``Establishing our own laws is an essential part of our
emancipation,'' said Saeb Erekat, a political scientist nominated to
serve on the interim Palestinian Authority. ``Legally, most of the
2,500 military orders issued by the Israelis became null and void with
their withdrawal last week, and so Arafat re-established the legal
framework for everyday life.''
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Authority, which will administer the Gaza Strip and
eventually most of the West Bank under the autonomy agreement with
Israel, will soon be faced with the task of adopting a basic law and
then extensive civil and criminal codes after elections planned for
October.
</P>
<P>
Some of the military regulations that have governed life here were
preserved as part of the agreements establishing Palestinian
self-government and the economic relations between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
But Arafat restored 1967 Jordanian law in Jericho and Egyptian in
Gaza, both to provide a familiar legal framework for the start of
Palestinian autonomy and to ``give people the sense of being masters
in their own home,'' Erekat said. ``It's better to have some
legislative gaps than to have Israeli military orders plugging them.''
</P>
<P>
Freij abu Midan, a Gaza lawyer and another member of the
Palestinian Authority, described the move as ``the first step toward
consolidating our national authority on the ground in Gaza and
Jericho.''
</P>
<P>
But abu Midan added that ``every day will bring scores of new
questions, especially to the police, for which the law will have no
immediate answer. We are feeling our way legally as well as
politically.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
In other developments, the Israeli military commander in the West
Bank closed Jericho for 24 hours to all but its 15,000 residents in
cooperation with the new Palestinian police commander, who reportedly
asked for a ``breather'' in order to get a firmer grip on the town and
to brief his men on regulations governing Israelis traveling through
it.
</P>
<P>
Israel contends that its agreement with the PLO enables Jewish
settlers to carry weapons in Palestinian-governed areas of Jericho and
the Gaza Strip. Palestinians assert that Israelis coming into the
autonomous areas may not carry weapons, and Palestinian police in
Jericho briefly detained five armed settlers Tuesday before releasing
them, reportedly with apologies.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, visiting the new Israeli positions
along the border with Gaza, at once praised the cooperation between
Palestinian police and his forces in the transfer of the region and
again warned Arafat that Israel will not turn over administration of
more of the West Bank until it sees how self-government works in Gaza
and Jericho.

 Mandela Presents Moderate Domestic Policy (Cape Town) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
CAPE TOWN, South Africa
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Nelson Mandela set forth a
moderate domestic policy agenda in his first major address to
parliament Tuesday, pledging to address the material wants left by
apartheid without resorting to deficit spending or permanent tax
increases.
</P>
<P>
The address, which amounted to a state-of-the-nation speech, seemed
tailored more for corporate boardrooms than the townships where many
of South Africa's poor blacks live. In many ways, it represented the
culmination of a shift in Mandela's African National Congress away
from socialism and to a version of market economics more in tune with
South Africa's present system.
</P>
<P>
Mandela thus struck a theme of fiscal discipline even as he
outlined his vision of a ``people-centered society'' where all South
Africans will be free from hunger, deprivation, ignorance, suppression
and fear.
</P>
<P>
He proposed reallocating about $700 million -- or roughly 3 percent
 -- of the 1994-95 national budget to programs for upgrading housing,
electricity, water and sewage systems, education and health services
for the nation's mostly black poor. That figure is to rise steadily
until it reaches more than $2.8 billion in the fifth year of the new
government's Reconstruction and Development Program.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said the money would come from across-the-board cuts in
other government departments. Even with the increased social spending,
he said he expected to reduce the government's annual deficit
spending, now running at 6.8 percent, and to avoid permanent tax
hikes.
</P>
<P>
In a briefing for reporters, Finance Minister Derek Keys -- a
holdover from the old National Party government -- acknowledged that
some temporary tax increases might be needed. But he said it should be
possible to finance the domestic agenda through civil service
attrition, streamlining of redundant apartheid bureaucracies and
spending cuts in certain areas, such as defense.
</P>
<P>
When the white minority government lifted the ban on liberation
organizations in 1990, most of the black leaders who came out of jail
or returned from exile were still wedded to a socialist vision of
wide-scale wealth redistribution. Over the ensuing years, ANC
officials won most of the constitutional debates about South Africa's
new political order, but Keys and the white business establishment
made them converts to market economics.
</P>
<P>
The ANC's economic ministers in the new coalition government, such
as former union leader Jay Naidoo, now say that if they overspend on
social programs, they will frighten investors and trigger
inflation-hobbling their best hope of using an expanding economy to
lift the lot of the poor.
</P>
<P>
``I always said we were a bloody conservative organization,'' ANC
spokesman Carl Niehaus quipped, only partly in jest, as he walked out
of parliament after the speech. The real test, as he and others
acknowledge, will come some years down the road. If the standard of
living of the poor has not risen, but the political temperature has,
can the ANC still remain faithful to fiscal discipline?
</P>
<P>
Mandela's first major policy speech held no decisive clues, but it
was notable for some of the things it left out. It made no mention of
the ANC's campaign promises to build 1 million new houses and
redistribute up to 30 percent of all arable land over the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
Those two goals constituted the symbolic heart of the ANC's plan to
provide ``a better life for all.'' However, experts in both fields say
it will be difficult to meet the targets. The country lacks the
resources to build 200,000 housing units a year, and the land
redistribution program will be slowed by a parallel promise that all
current landowners must be compensated.
</P>
<P>
Mandela did make specific promises Tuesday to provide free medical
care to all needy children under age 6 and pregnant mothers, and free
education up to age 16 for needy students. He also said that he
expects to be able to bring electricity to 350,000 new homes this
year, a program already underway by the electrical utility Eskom.
</P>
<P>
In a gesture to the minority community most apprehensive about
black majority rule, Mandela opened his speech by quoting the words of
an Afrikaner poet, Ingrid Jonker, and later delivered two paragraphs
of his speech in Afrikaans -- the language that once sparked widespread
rioting in black schools, where it has been seen as the language of
the oppressor.

 Hugh Price Named President of Urban League (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hugh Price, a senior officer of the Rockefeller
Foundation and former newspaper and television commentator on social
issues, Tuesday was named president of the National Urban League, the
nation's second-oldest civil rights organization.
</P>
<P>
Price, 52, succeeds John E. Jacob, who is retiring after a 30-year
association with the league, the last 12 as its president.
</P>
<P>
A native of Washington whose parents were active in the suffrage
and civil rights movements here, Price served from 1978 to 1982 as a
member of the editorial board of the New York Times, writing
editorials on such policy issues as public education, urban affairs,
welfare and criminal justice.
</P>
<P>
Price also served for six years as senior vice president of
WNET-13, New York City's public television station, where in 1984 he
assumed direction of national production functions.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, he was human resources administrator for the city of New
Haven, Conn., where he served as a member of the mayor's cabinet and
supervised the city's Head Start program and services for youth and
senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
Price attended segregated elementary schools in Washington and in
1954, following the Brown vs. Board of Education Supreme Court
decision, he attended desegregated junior high and high schools here.
</P>
<P>
Following his graduation from Yale Law School in 1966, Price worked
as a neighborhood attorney with the New Haven Legal Assistance
Association, maintaining a criminal law practice and representing
community organizations. Later he became a partner in Cogen, Holt and
Associates, an urban affairs consulting firm in New Haven that
specialized in community development, housing and other programs.
</P>
<P>
Reginald K. Brack Jr., chairman of the league's board of trustees
and chairman and chief executive officer of Time Inc., said that Price
``brings experience, vision, creativity and leadership to the Urban
League at a time when the African-American community is in great need
of an effective advocate for equal opportunity and a defender of
hard-earned civil rights.''
</P>
<P>
Price said he intends to ``fullfill the league's traditional
mandate combining social justice with economic growth and
opportunities.'' His agenda, he said, includes focusing public and
private recources more sharply on the problems of the urban poor;
equipping all African-American children with the academic competence
and social skills needed for self-sufficiency, and developing the
urban labor markets so that inner-city residents ``who want or are
expected to work can earn legitimate livings above the poverty line.''

 Fox Unveils its Brave New World for Fall 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Fox Broadcasting Co., newly armed with National Football League
games that helped the network land a dozen stations in a landmark deal
this week, on Tuesday announced a drama-heavy prime-time lineup for
fall in its latest bid to achieve parity with CBS, ABC and NBC.
</P>
<P>
Fox, known for dropping bombshells in late announcements of its
schedules, disclosed the coming acquisition of its latest affiliates
in time for the presentation of the new schedule to advertisers.
</P>
<P>
For nostalgia-prone couch potatoes, Fox also announced that one of
its back-up series for the 1994-95 season is an updated version of the
famous 1960s sitcom ``Get Smart,'' reuniting Don Adams and Barbara
Feldon as secret agents.
</P>
<P>
The youth-oriented network will have the new version of ``Get
Smart'' focusing on their son, who is in his late 20s and, like his
incompetent father, is a ``bumbling agent.''
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, Fox is using its flair for showmanship
to dilute the impact of serious setbacks in the past season. It
flopped in two key areas: late night, where Chevy Chase's show folded
quickly, and news, where its magazine series ``Front Page'' failed in
the ratings and now is canceled, to be replaced eventually by a new
effort called ``Assignment.'' In addition, Fox, known for its
outpouring of series featuring black performers last season, has
canceled five of them, including the prestigious ``Roc,'' the
controversial but much-praised and ambitious ``South Central'' -- which
reportedly is seeking a home elsewhere -- and ``In Living Color,''
``Sinbad'' and, previously, ``Townsend Television,'' which starred
Robert Townsend.
</P>
<P>
Several returning series, including ``Living Single'' and the racy
``Martin,'' star black performers. Sandy Grushow, president of the Fox
Entertainment Group, maintained, ``We're not walking away from our
commitment to program black television series.''
</P>
<P>
He noted that one of the new one-hour dramas, a police show called
``Uptown Undercover,'' pairs two officers, one black, the other
Latino. In addition, he said, another drama, ``M.A.N.T.I.S.,'' is
about a ``black superhero.''
</P>
<P>
With the cancellation of ``In Living Color,'' Fox is losing one of
its trademark series, an irreverent collection of sketches from a
black viewpoint. Said Grushow: ``We felt it was pretty well played
out. Obviously it was a landmark series for our company. For years, it
defined who we were and what we were about.''
</P>
<P>
Fox has scheduled as another back-up series a new sketch comedy
called ``House of Buggin','' which stars Latino comedian John
Leguizamo.
</P>
<P>
Grushow said ``Sinbad,'' which features the comedian of the same
name, was canceled because it ``had a huge `Simpsons' lead-in and was
unable to capitalize on it.'' As for ``Roc,'' although its quality
rarely diminished, it has had a difficult time in the ratings,
finishing near the bottom.
</P>
<P>
Other Fox shows from this season that got the ax include ``The
Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.,'' ``Bakersfield P.D.,'' ``Daddy
Dearest,'' ``Herman's Head,'' ``Monty,'' ``Code 3'' and ``Comic Strip
Live.''
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Another series, ``The George Carlin Show,'' failed to make the fall
lineup but is expected to return as a back-up entry, as is ``The
Critic,'' an animated program canceled by ABC but picked up by Fox.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Fox estimated it will take 1 to 1½ years before all
of the new stations that were reeled in this week are lined up for the
network. With Fox going to seven nights a week this past season and
now upgrading its affiliates in such major cities as Cleveland,
Atlanta, Detroit, Milwaukee and Dallas, the ratings of the 8-year-old
network will certainly go up, but just how much depends in great part
on the new programming, which consists of five dramas and two
comedies.
</P>
<P>
Grushow said the deal with New World Communications to land the
stations will have ``no effect whatsoever on the programs. These New
World stations are jumping into bed with us because they like our
business plan. They're interested in the 18-to-34 and 18-to-49
demographic.''
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
``The Simpsons'' now will return to Sundays at 8 p.m., where Fox
hopes that it and ``Fortune Hunter,'' a new, James Bond-style spy
adventure that precedes it at 7 p.m. -- and will challenge ``60
Minutes'' -- can benefit from the lead-in of the NFL games.
</P>
<P>
Aaron Spelling also is becoming a bigger player at Fox, where his
``Beverly Hills, 90210'' and ``Melrose Place'' will be joined by
another hour drama from his company, ``Models Inc.'' It stars Linda
Gray, formerly of ``Dallas,'' as the head of a Los Angeles modeling
agency. It gets an early start June 29.
</P>
<P>
Other new Fox series:
</P>
<P>
-- ``Party of Five,'' a drama in which five brothers and sisters
``forge new lives following the sudden loss of their parents'' in a
car crash.
</P>
<P>
-- ``Hardball,'' a ``rowdy'' sitcom that takes ``a locker-room look''
at baseball.
</P>
<P>
-- ``Wild Oats,'' a Generation X sitcom about ``a group of
out-all-night 20-somethings in search of romance and friendship.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Here's Fox's night-by-night lineup for fall:
</P>
<P>
Monday: ``Melrose Place,'' ``Party of Five.''
</P>
<P>
Tuesday: ``Fox Night at the Movies.''
</P>
<P>
Wednesday: ``Beverly Hills, 90210,'' ``Models Inc.''
</P>
<P>
Thursday: ``Martin,'' ``Living Single,'' ``Uptown Undercover.''
</P>
<P>
Friday: ``M.A.N.T.I.S.,'' ``The X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
Saturday: ``Cops,'' ``Cops 2,'' ``America's Most Wanted.''
</P>
<P>
Sunday: ``Fortune Hunter,'' ``The Simpsons,'' ``Hardball,''
``Married ... With Children,'' ``Wild Oats.''

 Bosnia President Seriously Considering Internationally Backed Peace
Plan 
 (Sarajevo) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bosnia's president said Tuesday his
government is seriously considering an internationally backed peace
plan that would give 51 percent of the country to allied Muslim and
Croat factions and 49 percent to rebel Serbs. But he demanded that the
United States issue a clear statement of its intentions before his
mostly Muslim cabinet approves the plan.
</P>
<P>
In an interview on his return from a pilgrimage to Mecca, President
Alija Izetbegovic also said he does not believe Bosnia's war is close
to ending, although he predicted some type of denouement in the fall.
``We're only eight or nine rounds into a 12-round fight,'' he said at
one point, employing a favorite boxing analogy. ``While we won't win
on a knockout, we will win on points.''
</P>
<P>
Izetbegovic said he had charged Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic with
finding out what the U.S. government is willing to do should Bosnia
accept the 51-49 plan. Silajdzic left Sarajevo Monday to attend
another round of negotiations at a French resort near Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Under that peace deal, first proposed by the European Union, Bosnia
would be partitioned into a Muslim-Croat federation and a
Serb-controlled half. The Serbs would then be free to join the
Muslim-Croat federation or merge with their political, military and
cultural patrons in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Muslim and Croat negotiators meeting in the
U.S. Embassy in Vienna drew up a map of the proposed federation's
territory that added up to 58 percent of Bosnia, leaving only 42
percent for the Serbs. When the United States joined its allies on May
13 in a reaffirmation of the 51-49 formula, the Sarajevo government
complained bitterly.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has said it would consider sending up to
25,000 American ground troops to Bosnia once the peace deal was
implemented. But Izetbegovic said he was loath to accept vague
statements of intention from any government because ``for two years
now we have seen what those add up to: nothing.''
</P>
<P>
``The Americans have let us read between the lines, but really we
are at war and that is not enough,'' he said. ``We need to know what
they will do if we accept and what they will do if the Serbs reject''
the peace plan. One of the reasons for Izetbegovic's demands for a
specific commitment concerns the fact that in Bosnia's eyes the West,
including the United States, has squandered its credibility in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
NATO ultimatums threatening airstrikes against Serb positions are
now routinely modified by U.N. officials here in what appears to be an
increasingly desperate effort to avoid the strikes. Izetbegovic said
the impression given by NATO's silence on the matter is that it too is
a willing partner in the dilution of the letter if not the intent of
its ultimatums to the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. spokesman Tuesday, for example, confirmed that Serb tanks
based inside a 12-mile artillery exclusion zone around Sarajevo were
firing on Muslim positions around Breza, north of the capital. Under
NATO's first Bosnian ultimatum, issued in February, those tanks are
subject to airstrikes. However, the spokesman, Dutch Maj. Rob Annink,
said the only option being considered was ``negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
Izetbegovic's comments Tuesday, while contradictory on the surface,
provided an insight into the maneuvers of the mostly Muslim government
and its army, which has struggled back from near demise less than a
year ago to relative stability today.
</P>
<P>
Emboldened by the apparent success of a peace deal between Bosnia's
Muslim and Croat factions, Izetbegovic now appears to believe time is
on the side of the Muslims in their standoff against the Serbs, who
occupy about 72 percent of this mountainous country.
</P>
<P>
Accepting the peace deal, according to the president's thinking,
would only be part of a broader and longer-term struggle against the
Serbs, widely held responsible for starting Europe's bloodiest
conflict since World War II. He said his government would not accept a
four-month cease-fire, proposed by the United States, Russia and the
major European powers earlier this month, because it would hamper the
Bosnian army and effectively preserve Serb war gains.
</P>
<P>
``Maybe four weeks, but not four months,'' he said. ``If it was
four months, it would freeze the Serb gains, literally, because by
then it would be winter.''
</P>
<P>
Currently, the lightly armed Bosnian army appears capable of
nibbling away at Serb-held territory but will not be able to mount
larger offensives until the fall. The largely Muslim government troops
are reluctant to engage the better-armed Serb forces in the dry
Bosnian summer because that is perfect tank weather. Once the fog and
rain of autumn comes, however, the more numerous Bosnian government
infantry will gain some tactical advantage.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the interview, Izetbegovic appeared almost jovial and a
different man from the downtrodden leader who paced the cavernous
halls of the presidency last year while Serb shells pounded his
capital.
</P>
<P>
``Last year I had a lot of good reasons to be depressed. We had a
new front opening with the Croats. We really saw no exit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Hinting that weapons already are coming in over the newly opened
roads from Croatia's Adriatic coast, Izetbegovic cited the importation
of ``food and other materials that I can't talk about'' as having a
positive effect on the war effort against the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
On May 13, The Washington Post reported that 60 tons of Iranian
explosives and raw materials for ammunition manufacturing had arrived
for Bosnia's weapons plants. Since then, Bosnian military sources have
said at least one shipload of Brazilian-made weaponry destined for
Bosnia has reached the Balkans.

 Sen. Robb Fails to Win Support of Gubernatorial Candidate 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Sen. Charles S. Robb's re-election campaign won't
have the support of his party's 1993 candidate for governor, two-time
Virginia attorney general Mary Sue Terry, who Tuesday endorsed one of
his challengers for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
The beneficiary of Terry's action was state Sen. Virgil H. Goode
Jr. of rural Rocky Mount, who hailed her support as the biggest boost
to his underdog campaign.
</P>
<P>
Terry has been closely allied with Robb, a former law school
classmate, throughout her career. The two were ticketmates in 1981,
when he was elected Virginia governor and she won her first term as
attorney general. And because both espouse a moderate-to-conservative
philosophy, Terry was sometimes called ``Chuck Robb in a skirt.''
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Robb said he'd ``been aware for some time that she
was thinking about endorsing Virgil, so it didn't come as a surprise,
and I didn't try to dissuade her.
</P>
<P>
``To her credit,'' he continued, Terry ``called me at home (Monday)
night to tell me what she planned to do, and I respect her for calling
me personally. If I am the Democratic nominee, I know she'll be with
me in November.''
</P>
<P>
Terry, who appeared with Goode at news conferences Tuesday in
Arlington and Richmond, declined to characterize her announcement as a
repudiation of Robb.
</P>
<P>
``The easy thing for me,'' she said, ``would have been to sit by
and just let whatever might happen in the primary happen. But I think
I would be shirking my responsibility as a Virginian if I did not do
what I could -- as small as that might be -- to make sure we have the
strongest possible candidate to prevent (Republican frontrunner)
Oliver North from becoming our senator. And I am convinced Virgil is
that candidate.''
</P>
<P>
Mary Washington College political scientist Mark J. Rozell said
Terry's snub of Robb ``may reflect a feeling among many leading
Democrats . . . (who) don't feel they have the luxury to speak out.''
</P>
<P>
Rozell said one upside to Terry's crushing loss in the 1993
gubernatorial race is that she has ``a degree of freedom to speak
openly.'' And while she may not carry much weight with the general
electorate, Rozell said, within the party ``she retains stature among
groups, such as women activists.''

 Postal Service Is in `Serious Financial Trouble,' Panel Told 
 (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Postal Service is in ``serious financial
trouble,'' facing a huge deficit and an uncertain future, witnesses
told a House committee Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Rep. William L. Clay, D-Mo., chairman of the House Committee on
Post Office and Civil Service, agreed with the dire assessments and
added one of his own, describing the Postal Service as ``a ship of
state that is not only rudderless, but captain-less. Whoever is
running the ship over there is not doing a good job.''
</P>
<P>
It was one of Clay's most caustic attacks on Postmaster General
Marvin T. Runyon, the former Tennessee auto maker whose budget-cutting
exploits have won him praise from many mailers. But in this, the fifth
of six oversight hearings into the agency's ability to compete with
new electronic technologies, Runyon's decisions came under increased
criticism.
</P>
<P>
During the hearing Tuesday, William H. LeBlanc III, the senior
member of the independent Postal Rate Commission, sent one of the
strongest signals of any witness that the Postal Service's finances
are more troubled that previously thought.
</P>
<P>
``It is my view that the Postal Service could hardly be worse off
financially and I see nothing on the horizon that will significantly
improve its present position,'' LeBlanc told the committee.
</P>
<P>
A Reagan appointee who has served on the five-member regulatory
panel since 1987, LeBlanc predicted the Postal Service is headed for a
$2.4 billion loss this year, well above the $1.3 billion loss that
Runyon had expected. LeBlanc said he has never been so worried about
the agency's future.
</P>
<P>
Without naming Runyon, LeBlanc also questioned the wisdom of the
postmaster general's decision to delay the next postage increase until
1995, noting that the agency could have captured an extra $3.9 billion
in revenues by filing its rate case 16 months earlier. ``This would
seem a high price to pay for rate stability,'' LeBlanc said.
</P>
<P>
The rate commission is considering a Postal Service request to
increase the price of a letter to 32 cents from 29 cents -- an increase
that Clay and others have suggested may be too small to cover the
agency's rapidly growing debt. Most of the unexpected costs have been
attributed to overtime that followed the retirements of many senior
workers in a Runyon-directed reorganization last year.
</P>
<P>
Postal spokeman Bob Hoobing declined to comment on Clay's remarks,
but he said LeBlanc had oversimplified the agency's finances. Runyon's
proposed 10.3 percent increase in postal rates ``will stabilize''
postal finances and prevent a large drop in mail volume. ``We're not
just sitting there and letting the tide roll over us,'' Hoobing said.
</P>
<P>
While LeBlanc said he was not speaking for the rate commission, he
was not alone in expressing concern over the future of the Postal
Service.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the General Accounting Office cautioned the
committee that the agency's effort to save money through automation
was not working and new technologies, such as computer messages and
fax machines were eroding the agency's mail monopoly. ``The risk to
the Postal Service posed by competition and changing technology is
very real,'' said GAO Associate Director Michael E. Motley.
</P>
<P>
Large chunks of mail have already been lost to the rapid growth of
new technologies, a GAO official said. Since 1971 the Postal Service
also has lost two key markets, overnight mail and parcel post, to
private firms because it failed to compete on price and service,
Motley said. Its share of parcels fell from 65 percent of the market
in 1971 to 6 percent in 1990 and its overnight Express Mail dropped
from 100 percent of the market in 1971 to 12 percent in 1990, he said.
</P>
<P>
Motley suggested that Congress might revise its postal laws to give
the Postal Service more flexibility on pricing and to allow discounts
to large mailers, steps the Postal Service has long requested. The GAO
official praised Runyon for attempting to take advantage of
technological developments, but he questioned whether any new service
the agency could create would generate enough revenue to replace the
mail it is likely to lose to new technology.
</P>
<P>
Edward J. Gleiman, the new chairman of the rate commission, also
suggested Runyon go slow on new ventures. ``There may be no real
reason for the Postal Service to seek business opportunities much
beyond the margins of its traditional business,'' Gleiman said.
</P>
<P>
But he also sounded the most optimistic of any witness Tuesday.
``For the intermediate term -- five to seven years out -- I think the
greatest threat to postal volumes is the Postal Service itself,'' he
told Clay. ``Service must be maintained and costs must be controlled
or all mailers will actively seek cheaper and more-reliable
alternatives to the mail.''
</P>
<P>
However, Gleiman did join the GAO in expressing concerns about the
future of first-class mail. Taxpayers could ultimately be stuck with
``a substantial bailout'' of an agency that currently gets virtually
no tax subsidies if mail volume falls substantially, Gleiman said.
</P>
<P>
In his questions Tuesday, Clay seemed to suggest that his final
witnesses -- the presidentially appointed board of postal governors who
oversee the agency -- will be questioned in detail about their
oversight of Runyon. ``I think they're being hoodwinked. ... I have
some doubt they're being given all the information they need,'' the
chairman said.
</P>
<P>
So far most of Clay's hearings have been receptive to Runyon. Last
week, however, postal unions sharply criticized his reorganization.
They described Runyon's decision to split all local mail operations
into two separate divisions -- customer service or mail processing -- 
whose local heads are often at odds. These disputes have to be
appealed to Washington to be resolved, a time-consuming process.

 Contraband Sails Into Haiti Despite Embargo (Jacmel) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
JACMEL, Haiti
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite a reinforced U.N. embargo that went into
effect Sunday, a flotilla of ships carrying contraband has sailed into
this port city, carrying merchandise including gasoline, cars and
color television sets.
</P>
<P>
Local residents said at least nine ships have docked since the
strengthened embargo started, in theory barring everything except
pre-approved shipments of food, medicine and propane gas. Five
remained Monday, and army officers directed trucks onto the docks to
unload the merchandise.
</P>
<P>
The embargo was imposed in October and reinforced by the U.N.
Security Council on Sunday in an effort to force the military to allow
the return of ousted president Jean-Bertrand Aristide. He was
overthrown in a military coup in September 1991, six months after
becoming Haiti's first democratically elected leader.
</P>
<P>
The ships, which flew British, Jamaican, Colombian, Dominican,
Bahamian and Haitian flags, demonstrated how difficult it could be to
enforce the measure, especially since the ships largely ply the waters
between Haiti and the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
The two nations share the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. While the
United States and other nations maintain warships and Coast Guard
cutters offshore, they cannot legally enter the three-mile territorial
limit, and so the ships often can just skirt the shoreline and enter
without interference.
</P>
<P>
``So far, the ships have been triple-parked out there,'' said one
longtime resident, watching as they bobbed, waiting to be unloaded.
``It has been years since the port was that busy.''
</P>
<P>
Diplomats involved in monitoring the embargo said it could take
weeks to figure out how to plug its leaks, and admitted that the
officers who control the contraband could build up substantial
stockpiles in the meantime. This means the measure would not really
begin to have an impact on the rich and on the officer corps for
several weeks, they said.
</P>
<P>
But it is a question whether the wealthy or the officer corps will
suffer. While reporters watched, uniformed army officers supervised
the unloading of a truckload of color televisions and other electronic
goods. At the port entrance, a small market has sprung up, and
residents said there had been an influx of prostitutes to keep pace
with the growing number of ships.
</P>
<P>
Residents said that at times over the weekend there were nine
tanker trucks on the dock getting fuel from tanks on visiting ships.
Other ships unloaded vehicles and luxury goods. The Bahamian-flagged
Sea Search, a seagoing tug that on Saturday was engaged by a U.S.
picket ship enforcing the embargo, was in port here Monday, its
barrels of fuel being unloaded under the supervision of military
officers.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said an armed fight nearly broke out in the stately La
Jacmelienne Hotel here Saturday night when a subordinate of powerful
police commander Lt. Col. Michel Francois, identified as Maj. Oiseau,
arrived with several other officers to supervise the unloading of
fuel.
</P>
<P>
According to several accounts, the owner of the hotel refused
Oiseau a room for the night because he and the other officers were not
paying for food or drinks. Oiseau reportedly began waving a gun around
and threatening to kill hotel employees, while the hotel owner also
brought out a gun. Only the intervention of Col. Lyonel Sylvain, the
regional commander, avoided a major shootout, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The witnesses, who asked not to be identified for their personal
safety, said another ship, the Oakleigh, flying the Union Jack and
registered in Aberdeen, Scotland, made several trips a week over the
last several months to the Dominican Republic, bringing back about
15,000 gallons of fuel at a time.
</P>
<P>
Residents here and knowledgeable sources in Port-au-Prince, the
capital, said much of the Jacmel fuel flow is controlled by an
important fuel wholesaler named Gerald Caroli. Knowledgeable sources
said Caroli is a major fuel supplier of the U.S. Embassy and other
diplomatic missions.
</P>
<P>
While ships were unloaded, a Dominican vessel sat about a mile from
the dock, abandoned because its captain, known only as ``Dirty
Harry,'' fled for his life when the buyers of his fuel found some of
the diesel was full of sludge and unusable.

 Rwandan Rebels Claim Altruistic Purpose (Rwamagana) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
RWAMAGANA, Rwanda
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some of them are only boys, 14 or 15 years old,
wearing sheepish grins and raggedy uniforms that make them appear no
more threatening than toy soldiers. They smile easily, but the smile
does not reach their eyes.
</P>
<P>
Already these boys are wartime veterans, warriors who have no rank,
collect no pay and travel on foot, lugging an odd assortment of
French, Belgian and Soviet weapons. They sleep on the ground, stuff
bullets in their pockets and have not yet learned to salute or
field-strip a rifle. ``It's not a bad life,'' said one of the boys
manning a checkpoint here on the road to Kigali, the capital. ``One
day I go back to my father's farm. Today I fight.''
</P>
<P>
The boys are part of the Rwandan Patriotic Front, a guerrilla group
whose roots go back to 1959 but who remained virtually unknown to the
world-at-large until its members launched a major offensive April 6
that has now chased government soldiers out of half of this
beleaguered, impoverished nation.
</P>
<P>
In the process, the front has become part of Africa's
post-independence legacy. Page by page, over 40 years, guerrilla
groups from Angola to Kenya have rewritten the history of the
continent. The results have not always been beneficial for the people
in whose name the rebellions were launched.
</P>
<P>
The first guerrilla wars, like Jomo Kenyatta's Mau Mau rebellion in
Kenya in the early 1960s, were undertaken to drive out the European
colonialists. Each succeeded, and from bloodied Angola and
Guinea-Bissau in the west to Mozambique in the east and Rhodesia (now
Zimbabwe and Zambia) in the south, power was transferred to the
Africans. With the election of Nelson Mandela to South Africa's
presidency last month, all 47 sub-Saharan African countries are now
governed by the black majority.
</P>
<P>
Today, the purpose of guerrilla groups like the Rwanda Patriotic
Front -- and others that have fought in Mozambique, Angola, Somalia,
Ethiopia and Djibouti -- is to dislodge a ruling African elite in the
name of reform. Under whatever banner they may fight, the rebels'
ultimate purpose is always the same -- power: economic, political and
sometimes tribal.
</P>
<P>
``I know this African history, and I swear to you we are
different,'' said an RPF officer who requested anonymity. ``We are
fighting to install a government of national unity. We want democracy
and reform. The first thing we will do is get rid of the cards
identifying your ethnic group that the government makes everyone
carry.''
</P>
<P>
Although such lofty ideals are heard often in Africa, the RPF,
composed mostly of members of the minority Tutsi tribe, has proved
itself a more disciplined, organized military force than the Rwandan
army and its fearful Hutu-dominated militias that have run pell-mell
through the countryside, massacring untold thousands of civilians.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Villagers cheered the arrival of RPF troops along the road to the
Tanzanian border last month, but many Rwandans, especially Hutus,
remain deeply skeptical about the rebels' ultimate goals and feel that
they may begin a new round of bloodletting to avenge the massacres
they have endured.
</P>
<P>
``I will never return to Rwanda if the RPF is in power,'' said
Eliachim Mulindandabi, a 20-year-old Hutu refugee in Tanzania's Benaco
camp. ``It would not be safe. For me or any Hutu. They are killers,
and they would hunt us down.''
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
The RPF fighters are mostly Rwandan Tutsi refugees whose families
escaped to Uganda after a 1959 revolution that ended 400 years of
Tutsi domination over the Hutus, who represent 90 percent of Rwanda's
8 million people. Historically, the Tutsis formed the intellectual and
professional core of Rwandan society. Until the revolution, they held
the Hutu farmers in a form of feudal serfdom surpassed only in
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
In Uganda, many of the Rwandan refugees were recruited as
mercenaries in the National Resistance Army that, with the help of
Tanzanian soldiers and Ugandan dissidents, overthrew Ugandan dictator
Idi Amin in the 1970s. The rebel leader, Yoweri Museveni, became
president of Uganda in 1986 and has not forgotten his debt: Uganda
provides the RPF with its lifeline of weapons, ammunition and
supplies.
</P>
<P>
Many RPF rebels speak English learned in Uganda, while the
Zaire-supported Rwandan army speaks French or Kinyarwanda, the
language shared by both Hutus and Tutsis. Some of the rebels have
returned to join the battle from jobs abroad as accountants, teachers
and a variety of middle-class positions.
</P>
<P>
``I deal with the RPF every day, and I found them very
responsible,'' said a French doctor who works in rebel-controlled
territory. ``But they're having a lot of trouble doing all the things
you have to do when you administer civilian authority. That I don't
think they're prepared to handle.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Ever since the Hutus began demanding political reform in 1957,
there have been outbreaks of fierce violence between the Hutus and
Tutsis in Rwanda and neighboring Burundi. Thousands of Tutsis in
Rwanda were massacred in Hutu-organized slaughters in 1959 and 1963.
The most recent unrest began Oct. 5, 1990, when fighting broke out in
Kigali between the rebels and the army, and it has since become a
civil war.

 Yeltsin Decrees Usher New Phase of Economic Reform (Moscow) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Russia is entering a new phase in its economic reforms and
will now concentrate on fighting its disastrous industrial slump and
bringing order to its tax system, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
``You could call this the beginning of the stabilization period,''
Economics Minister Alexander N. Shokhin said, ``although the
statistics don't bear that out yet.''
</P>
<P>
The statistics show that in Russia's stumbling transition from
centrally planned socialism to a market-driven economy, it is managing
to damp inflation -- the main task of recent months.
</P>
<P>
But its industry is on the verge of collapse, with production
plummeting 25 percent in the first quarter compared to last year; its
tax system is a mess, and it is desperately short of investment money.
The Economics Ministry has warned that, if unemployment mounts, this
could lead to a ``social explosion.''
</P>
<P>
After months of pleas for change from factory directors and
pressure from his industry-oriented prime minister, President Boris N.
Yeltsin has made the troubled economy his focus in recent days.
</P>
<P>
The results appeared Monday. Six presidential decrees rolled off
the presses, all of them aimed at bringing some order to the Russian
economy, at introducing enough control so that, as presidential
adviser Alexander Livshits put it, ``there will be a little less
robbery.''
</P>
<P>
The decrees introduce harsh penalties for tax evaders and require
factories to register all their bank accounts if they want to receive
government subsidies. They also provide a panoply of ways of
controlling factories' finances better while lifting some of the
crushing tax burden from them.
</P>
<P>
``A number of measures taken by the government have allowed the
economy to be stabilized to some extent,'' Deputy Economics Minister
Sergei Vasilyev optimistically told a conference here.
</P>
<P>
One decree also sharply reduces export tariffs on oil and other
goods and does away with the system of special export licenses that
had provided the basis for massive red tape and bureaucratic
corruption.
</P>
<P>
``The most important decree of the package is the decree on doing
away with export quotas and licenses,'' said Mikhail Berger, economics
columnist for the newspaper Izvestia, ``because it will destroy the
entire structure of massive bribe-taking, a structure that includes
armies of corrupt officials. With the disappearance of the quotas and
licenses, the very reason for taking and giving bribes will cease to
exist.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional Add End)
</P>
<P>
Shokhin said obstacles to the export of oil and other fuel had to
be lifted because the industry is on the verge of a shutdown; domestic
prices have risen so much that demand for oil has dropped sharply.
Export, meanwhile, was limited by licensing, so producers had nowhere
to sell their oil and were beginning to stop drilling.
</P>
<P>
Still to come are promised presidential decrees on procedures for
going bankrupt -- Yeltsin is finally beginning to accept that monstrous
loss-makers must be allowed to go under -- and on limiting salaries.
</P>
<P>
Although the decrees are not quite bombshells, Shokhin said that
taken together they reach ``critical mass to provide added impulse''
to the reforms.

 FCC Chief Sees No Further Rate Cuts for Cable TV (New Orleans) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW ORLEANS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the cable TV industry reeling from 17 percent in
forced rate reductions, Federal Communications Commission Chairman
Reed Hundt told industry executives meeting here Tuesday that he
foresees no further cuts.
</P>
<P>
``I know of no evidence to support a further reduction ... and we
are not looking for such evidence,'' said Hundt, seeking to ease
concerns of cable executives .
</P>
<P>
The FCC chairman said that he had ``sympathy and concern'' for the
plight of cable operators who complained that the rollbacks
handicapped them in the race to build the ``information
superhighway.'' At the same time, Hundt defended the rollbacks,
arguing that the cable TV industry is extremely healthy and that the
new regulations would help promote competition. ``I'm not here to
eulogize at your wake,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hundt indicated that the FCC would not enact a
so-called ``productivity offset'' that could have forced many cable
company operators to scale back rates a further 2 percent, largely
wiping out increases they can pass along to subscribers because of
inflation.
</P>
<P>
``This sort of offset is generally found in the regulations of a
utility, but cable is not a utility,'' explained Hundt.
</P>
<P>
The cable TV industry has been vociferous in its complaints about
the new rollbacks, claiming the cuts will cost the industry some $3
billion a year in cash flow. The reduction in cash flow will in turn
prevent operators from borrowing money to invest the capital for the
building of the broad-band, 500-channel cable TV system of the future
that is supposed to provide customers a panoply of new home shopping
services, movies-on-demand, and video games.
</P>
<P>
The reaction among cable TV operators to Hundt's remarks was
optimistic but cautious. ``This is good, but God is in the details,''
said Tim Boggs, a vice president with Time Warner Inc., the country's
second largest cable TV operator.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Hundt offered few specifics about the kind of
``refinement'' the FCC had in mind to its implementation of the rate
rollbacks mandated by Congress in 1992. He acknowledged, however, that
the FCC was looking for ``programming incentives'' that would
encourage operators to put on new channels while keeping some
flexibility in pricing.
</P>
<P>
Cable TV stocks appeared to react favorably to Hundt's remarks,
with many registering strong gains for the day. Raymond L. Katz,
senior vice president at Lehman Bros., expressed a sigh of relief.
</P>
<P>
``I have clients who have obsessed about that 2 percent off-set.
They wouldn't buy cable stocks as a result of that. Up until now the
FCC has focused on the political aspects. Now they appear willing to
focus on the economics.,'' he said.

 Pact Opens Way to Protect Vietnamese-Americans in Vietnam (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Clinton administration has concluded an agreement
with the government of Vietnam that will open the way for U.S.
diplomats to represent and protect Vietnamese-Americans on Vietnamese
soil, U.S. officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement means that any Vietnamese-Americans who are arrested
or imprisoned in Vietnam will be entitled to have American diplomats
visit them and try to ensure they are treated humanely and fairly. It
also means that U.S. diplomats in Vietnam can try to locate
Vietnamese-Americans who are missing, can help Vietnamese-Americans
replace lost U.S. passports, and can try to arrange money transfers
for Vietnamese-Americans who are robbed.
</P>
<P>
The understanding is one part of a broader accord in which Vietnam
and the United States agreed to open up liaison offices in each
other's capital cities. These offices, to be staffed by at least 10
diplomats apiece, will carry out some of the functions of embassies
until diplomatic relations are established between the two
governments.
</P>
<P>
The move to set up liaison offices is one of several recent
indications that the Clinton administration is taking new steps to
upgrade U.S. relations with Vietnam. Last week, Vietnam's Deputy
Premier Tran Duc Luong visited Washington for talks with Secretary of
State Warren Christopher. ``The point is that we have taken another
step forward,'' a senior administration official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton proposed the creation of liaison offices when he
lifted the trade embargo against Vietnam last February. But the final
arrangements were not worked out until last Friday, after Luong's
visit, when Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord signed the
documents spelling out the details.
</P>
<P>
``We have now agreed on consular protection (for
Vietnamese-Americans), and we can begin to look for property and open
up the offices,'' said one senior administration official.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Vietnam took the position that Vietnamese-Americans
are not entitled to the protection of American diplomats, because they
are Vietnamese nationals. But the Clinton administration stuck to the
traditional U.S. view that such people are American citizens, and are
entitled to the same consular protection as other Americans.
</P>
<P>
``They (the Vietnamese government) finally came around on this
issue,'' said a State Department official.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990 census, 615,000 Americans identified themselves as
being of Vietnamese descent. In recent years, many
Vietnamese-Americans have been returning home to do business or to
visit relatives.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
The new U.S. liaison office in Hanoi could be opened within the
next two months. ``It's a matter of finding the property,'' a State
Department official said.
</P>
<P>
American and Vietnamese officials also have agreed on a return of
the properties that each government owned on the other's soil.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government will get back 32 properties that it owned in
Vietnam, most of them in Ho Chi Minh City, the former Saigon. The
Hanoi government will get back a single property, the building that
served before the end of the war as South Vietnam's embassy in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. properties will probably include one of the most famous
and photographed buildings in the world: the former U.S. embassy in
Saigon, from which crowds of Americans and Vietnamese were evacuated
by helicopter at the end of the war in April 1975.
</P>
<P>
Administration officials have said the United States will not
establish formal diplomatic relations with Vietnam until after Hanoi
cooperates further in the task of accounting for Americans missing in
action during the war.

 Japanese Foreign Minister Announces Trade `Understanding' With U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Smiling and clearly relieved after three months of angry
silence, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa said late Tuesday night the
world's two biggest economic powers had gone through a tortured series
of negotiations but finally been able to ``give birth to an
understanding.''
</P>
<P>
The understanding to restart trade talks was no easy birth and
largely symbolic, but after a bitter and acrimonious dispute it was
greeted in Japan as a clear sign that U.S.-Japanese relations are
heading along the right path and toward agreement on substantive
points.
</P>
<P>
``There is no way we will (now) fail,'' said government spokesman
Hiroshi Kumagai, who used to run the Ministry of Trade and Industry,
which headed the trade talks.
</P>
<P>
Other Japanese leaders also suggested that the deal meant that
crucial barriers to a more comprehensive trade agreement with the
United States had been broken.
</P>
<P>
``I am absolutely confident we will find a way,'' Prime Minister
Tsutomu Hata said.
</P>
<P>
Formal trade negotiations broke down in February when former Prime
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa flatly rejected U.S. demands, saying the
Japanese had come of age politically and could stand down the United
States. His defiance was initially hailed here as historic and
courageous.
</P>
<P>
But as Japan's trade surpluses soared, its currency strengthened
and economy languished, Hosokawa's emphatic rejection provoked
widespread consternation that Japan's most important political and
economic relationship was fraying badly.
</P>
<P>
The breakdown also reflected badly on the United States, which was
viewed as trying to bully Asians into accepting U.S. standards on
trade, justice and human rights. For example, the United States
recently criticized Singapore for caning a youth convicted of
vandalism and threatened trade sanctions against China for human
rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
Two months of acrimony finally broke in mid-April with informal
talks. When Japanese officials went to the United States last weekend,
they expected at least one more round of preliminary negotiations
before the pivotal framework talks could restart.
</P>
<P>
What they found instead, said a participant in the negotiations,
was ``that the atmosphere was far more conciliatory, and far less
confrontational and hawkish'' than before.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Two specific obstacles had led to the collapse of talks in
February: Japan's unwillingness to stimulate its economy by cutting
taxes as much as the United States wanted and Japan's refusal to use
specific measurements to gauge improvement in trade issues.
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, Japanese officials say, they found that the
United States had backed down on both points.
</P>
<P>
In terms of an extended tax cut, the United States became convinced
that Japan's chaotic political scene precluded any near-term
commitment to a sustained fiscal policy -- tax cut or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
The officials also said the United States backed off demands for
numerical indicators to track Japan's willingness to absorb imports.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials had strenuously denied ever emphasizing a strict
numerical indicator, but Japanese officials said that the United
States had privately pushed for indicators.

 Russia to Join NATO's Partnership for Peace Program (Brussels) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BRUSSELS, Belgium
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Russia said Tuesday that it will join NATO's
new Partnership for Peace program for former East Bloc countries
despite its earlier reservations, but it hinted that it still may seek
some political concessions in return.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization defense
ministers, Russian defense chief Pavel S. Grachev told reporters that
President Boris N. Yeltsin has ``instructed me that I should make it
clear that Russia will join the ... program.''
</P>
<P>
He also denied that Russia would demand a formal side agreement
providing it with more status than other countries in the program, as
Moscow had suggested earlier. ``We are not going to set forth any
conditions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
But Western officials continued to be wary, mindful of earlier
indications that Moscow would demand that NATO agree to some sort of
new protocol that would give Moscow more authority beyond the
Partnership for Peace program.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William J. Perry told reporters after
Grachev's news conference that he still does not know precisely what
demands Moscow will make.
</P>
<P>
Grachev's appearance followed a series of Russian flip-flops over
the issue of whether to join the program. Moscow had been expected to
apply for membership last month but balked in protest over NATO air
strikes against Serb rebel forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
The Russian defense minister is scheduled to provide details
Wednesday about what demands, if any, Moscow will make.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Russian membership is important because establishing a
formal relationship with NATO is viewed by the West as an important
step in strengthening ties between the two former foes.
</P>
<P>
Some Western officials fear that if Moscow chooses not to join the
program, it could bolster the influence of hard-liners in Russia who
want the government to keep the West at arm's length.
</P>
<P>
But some analysts believe the issue of special status is mainly
symbolic and that Moscow is looking primarily for a political gesture
that will help counter complaints by nationalists that post-Cold War
Russia is not being accorded due respect.
</P>
<P>
Grachev himself appeared to be playing to that end Tuesday when he
made a point of declaring that the NATO ministers had been ``listening
to me carefully'' and were ``sympathetic'' to Russia's plans.
</P>
<P>
The Partnership for Peace program was adopted at a NATO summit in
January as a way to strengthen ties with former East Bloc countries by
giving them a sort of auxiliary status involving consultations and
some joint exercises.
</P>
<P>
As of Tuesday, 18 former Soviet satellites, from Poland to
Kazakhstan, have formally joined the program, and the Netherlands has
announced that it will hold military exercises with the Poles some
time this autumn.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
The West's major objection to providing any special status for the
Russians is a fear by some other former East Bloc countries that
Moscow will dominate the new program -- eventually regaining control
over their affairs.
</P>
<P>
Both Western and former East Bloc countries also are fearful about
Moscow's new assertions that Russia should have the right to send
troops to former Soviet satellites, such as Georgia, in which large
numbers of Russians live.
</P>
<P>
Perry and other key NATO ministers made it clear Tuesday that they
recognize that Russia's relationship with NATO is likely to be broader
than that of other countries because of its size and the fact that it
is a nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
``Russia and NATO need a solid partnership,'' German Defense
Minister Volker Ruehe said. ``Russia must be treated and perceived to
be treated as a great power.''
</P>
<P>
But Sergio Balanzino, NATO's deputy secretary general, told
reporters that the Western ministers had already decided that Moscow's
membership in the partnership program must adhere to the same rules as
that of other countries.
</P>
<P>
Even if Grachev and the ministers reach agreement in principle
Wednesday, officials say it is unlikely that NATO would act on the
application before early June, when NATO's foreign ministers are
scheduled to meet in Istanbul, Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Grachev met with NATO ministers late Tuesday, but U.S. officials
said he merely briefed the group on Moscow's new military doctrine and
did not address the membership question.
</P>
<P>
Apart from their meeting with Grachev, the NATO ministers also
issued a communique warning that North Korea's nuclear weapons program
poses ``a grave risk'' to global security, presenting the world with a
``serious'' problem.

 Washington Softening Hard Line on Cable-TV Industry (New Orleans) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW ORLEANS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Washington is softening its hard line on the
cable-television industry.
</P>
<P>
After angering the industry by ordering two cable price cuts in 10
months, federal regulators are talking about ways to give cable
operators ``incentives'' -- code language for permitting them to raise
prices when they add new channels or offer new services.
</P>
<P>
Federal Communications Commission Chairman Reed Hundt -- until now
the cable industry's Public Enemy No. 1 -- mollified executives
gathered here Tuesday for the industry's national convention by
suggesting that the FCC will consider tweaking its price regulations
in the next few months to make them more cable-friendly.
</P>
<P>
The early hour -- 7:30 a.m. over breakfast -- miffed some cable
executives, who wondered why Hundt couldn't take part in the
conference's regular session. They gave subdued applause and remained
silent during some of his gag lines. But in general they seemed
placated.
</P>
<P>
Hundt said it may be necessary to give cable companies a higher
markup than the rules now allow when they add new channels or invest
in the so-called information highway.
</P>
<P>
``More refinement (of these rules) may be necessary,'' he said,
adding, ``We need to make sure that (government regulation) does not
block any cable company from making investments necessary to offer the
... services of the future.''
</P>
<P>
He stopped short of making firm promises, other than to reassure
cable operators that the FCC wasn't looking to cut rates more than the
average 17 percent rollback already ordered.
</P>
<P>
Despite the industry's gripes, Hundt until now has maintained that
the effect of the FCC price cut on the industry's financial health was
still unclear, and could even help it.
</P>
<P>
FCC aides said Tuesday they had no hard evidence demonstrating that
additional incentives were justified; indeed, many of the nation's
11,000 cable systems haven't yet calculated the exact impact of the
average 17 percent cut due to complicated formulas that make each
system's number different.
</P>
<P>
But cable executives have lobbied the FCC hard in recent weeks for
changes, and have been highly public in denouncing the new rules.
During the convention's opening session Monday, for example, the
president of the sponsoring National Cable Television Association,
Decker Anstrom, called the FCC's cable regulations ``a political
caning.''
</P>
<P>
Anstrom Tuesday called Hundt's latest remarks ``a good start.''
</P>
<P>
Investors appeared to agree, bidding up the price of several cable
stocks. Tele-Communications Inc. closed at $20.50, up $1.50; Time
Warner Inc. closed at $39.25, up $1.37½; and Turner Broadcasting
System Inc.'s B shares ended the day at $18.37½, up 75 cents.
</P>
<P>
Among the FCC's most vociferous critics at this year's convention
were entrepreneurs who are attempting to launch new basic cable
networks. Representatives of more than 120 proposed cable channels
dotted the floor of the convention center here seeking to convince
system owners to carry their offerings.
</P>
<P>
Among the fledgling services are the Crime Channel, the Ecology
Channel, the Filipino Channel, Pet Television Network, the Therapy
Channel, as well as channels devoted to parenting, home shopping,
games and other subjects.
</P>
<P>
The programmers were in a dour mood because they say the FCC's
rules have put a cloud over their prospects. The current regulations
permit a cable operator to charge subscribers 7.5 percent above the
operator's cost of adding a new channel -- a margin that programmers
say is too low.
</P>
<P>
``The incentives just aren't there,'' said J. Carter Brown, former
director of the National Gallery in Washington, who is working on the
launch of an arts channel called Ovation. ``If an operator is going to
risk his capital'' to add and promote a new channel, ``there has to be
a better return.''
</P>
<P>
Under the current rules, operators will add new channels not as
groups but on a stand-alone basis since such ``a la carte'' channels
are not subject to price regulation, said John Hendricks, president of
Discovery Communications Inc., parent of the Discovery Channel. ``If
the regulations aren't changed,'' he said, ``new services will only be
available to the affluent.''
</P>
<P>
Although Hundt has now put that issue on the table at the FCC, the
Supreme Court may come to the industry's aid first. The court is
expected to decide soon on the cable industry's challenge to a portion
of the cable law that requires operators to carry local broadcast
stations.
</P>
<P>
This ``must-carry'' requirement has forced cable operators to make
room for broadcasters by bumping some cable-only channels, including
C-SPAN, off their systems. If the court sides with the cable industry,
cable operators would be free to dump broadcast stations they didn't
want, opening many new slots for cable networks.

 Intensive Breast Cancer Tests May Not Prolong Life 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Women who routinely undergo intensive tests, X-rays and bone scans
after treatment for breast cancer do not live longer than women who
rely on routine physical exams and mammograms, two studies show.
</P>
<P>
Results of two Italian studies, each of which tracked more than
1,000 women, were to be reported in Wednesday's issue of the Journal
of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
The studies concluded that while expensive tests such as chest
X-rays, liver scans and bone scans enabled physicians to diagnose the
spread of cancer faster, the earlier diagnosis did nothing to lengthen
survival or improve quality of life.
</P>
<P>
One study, by the Interdisciplinary Group for Cancer Care
Evaluation in Milan, followed 1,320 breast cancer patients under the
age of 70 for five years. Half the women underwent intensive testing;
the others had routine mammograms and checkups. The researchers found
that 20 percent of the group subjected to intensive tests died,
compared with 18 percent of the other group. The difference in death
rates was not statistically significant.
</P>
<P>
In the other study, researchers in Florence followed 1,243 women
for five years after breast cancer surgery, determining that X-rays
and bone scans should be limited to patients with suspicious symptoms.

 It's Holiday Sale Time at Your Local Airline Counter 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's holiday sale time at your local airline counter.
</P>
<P>
Almost all major U.S. airlines said Tuesday they will take you up
to 750 miles and back for $99 this coming weekend anywhere they fly
within the United States, except Hawaii and Alaska. If your
destination is more than 750 miles away, the cost is $139 per round
trip.
</P>
<P>
As usual, there are restrictions. First, all flights have to be
taken between noon Saturday and midnight Sunday. Second, you have to
buy your ticket within 24 hours of making the reservation. And third,
seats are ``limited,'' but most airlines said they have plenty of
unsold seats available.
</P>
<P>
It's the availability of the seats that is the motivation for the
sale.
</P>
<P>
``This is a slow travel period. This late, you've either got the
seats sold or you're not going to sell them'' at the regular prices,
said Delta Air Lines Inc. spokesman Bill Berry.
</P>
<P>
Delta kicked off a similar sale over the Christmas and New Year
holidays and was first to post the sale prices for this coming
weekend. Berry said the one-day Christmas sale netted $500,000 in
additional revenue and the two-day New Year sale took in $1 million.
</P>
<P>
For the most part, this is additional revenue for the airlines,
which fly their schedules whether a dozen passengers are aboard or the
plane is full. A $99 passenger is better than no passenger, and no
revenue.
</P>
<P>
With their sophisticated computer systems, airlines can judge
several days in advance of a flight whether they are likely to have a
large number of unsold seats. The likelihood of little last-minute
business traffic on a holiday weekend then creates an opening for a
``super sale.''
</P>
<P>
Even Southwest Airlines Co. and Continental Airlines Inc. jumped on
the bandwagon, although each noted they regularly offer lower fares -- 
Southwest throughout its system and Continental on its Peanut Fares
flights.
</P>
<P>
``We won't raise our fares,'' joked a Continental spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Several low-fare carriers allow a regular paying passenger to take
along another traveler for an additional penny or another nominal sum,
beating even a $99 promotional fare on a few routes if two people are
traveling.

 Washington Softening Hard Line on Cable-TV Industry (New Orleans) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW ORLEANS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Washington is softening its hard line on the
cable-television industry.
</P>
<P>
After angering the industry by ordering two cable price cuts in 10
months, federal regulators are talking about ways to give cable
operators ``incentives'' -- code language for permitting them to raise
prices when they add new channels or offer new services.
</P>
<P>
Federal Communications Commission Chairman Reed Hundt -- until now
the cable industry's Public Enemy No. 1 -- mollified executives
gathered here Tuesday for the industry's national convention by
suggesting that the FCC will consider tweaking its price regulations
in the next few months to make them more cable-friendly.
</P>
<P>
The early hour -- 7:30 a.m. over breakfast -- miffed some cable
executives, who wondered why Hundt couldn't take part in the
conference's regular session. They gave subdued applause and remained
silent during some of his gag lines. But in general they seemed
placated.
</P>
<P>
Hundt said it may be necessary to give cable companies a higher
markup than the rules now allow when they add new channels or invest
in the so-called information highway.
</P>
<P>
``More refinement (of these rules) may be necessary,'' he said,
adding, ``We need to make sure that (government regulation) does not
block any cable company from making investments necessary to offer the
... services of the future.''
</P>
<P>
He stopped short of making firm promises, other than to reassure
cable operators that the FCC wasn't looking to cut rates more than the
average 17 percent rollback already ordered.
</P>
<P>
Despite the industry's gripes, Hundt until now has maintained that
the effect of the FCC price cut on the industry's financial health was
still unclear, and could even help it.
</P>
<P>
FCC aides said Tuesday they had no hard evidence demonstrating that
additional incentives were justified; indeed, many of the nation's
11,000 cable systems haven't yet calculated the exact impact of the
average 17 percent cut due to complicated formulas that make each
system's number different.
</P>
<P>
But cable executives have lobbied the FCC hard in recent weeks for
changes, and have been highly public in denouncing the new rules.
During the convention's opening session Monday, for example, the
president of the sponsoring National Cable Television Association,
Decker Anstrom, called the FCC's cable regulations ``a political
caning.''
</P>
<P>
Anstrom Tuesday called Hundt's latest remarks ``a good start.''
</P>
<P>
Investors appeared to agree, bidding up the price of several cable
stocks. Tele-Communications Inc. closed at $20.50, up $1.50; Time
Warner Inc. closed at $39.25, up $1.37½; and Turner Broadcasting
System Inc.'s B shares ended the day at $18.37½, up 75 cents.
</P>
<P>
Among the FCC's most vociferous critics at this year's convention
were entrepreneurs who are attempting to launch new basic cable
networks. Representatives of more than 120 proposed cable channels
dotted the floor of the convention center here seeking to convince
system owners to carry their offerings.
</P>
<P>
Among the fledgling services are the Crime Channel, the Ecology
Channel, the Filipino Channel, Pet Television Network, the Therapy
Channel, as well as channels devoted to parenting, home shopping,
games and other subjects.
</P>
<P>
The programmers were in a dour mood because they say the FCC's
rules have put a cloud over their prospects. The current regulations
permit a cable operator to charge subscribers 7.5 percent above the
operator's cost of adding a new channel -- a margin that programmers
say is too low.
</P>
<P>
``The incentives just aren't there,'' said J. Carter Brown, former
director of the National Gallery in Washington, who is working on the
launch of an arts channel called Ovation. ``If an operator is going to
risk his capital'' to add and promote a new channel, ``there has to be
a better return.''
</P>
<P>
Under the current rules, operators will add new channels not as
groups but on a stand-alone basis since such ``a la carte'' channels
are not subject to price regulation, said John Hendricks, president of
Discovery Communications Inc., parent of the Discovery Channel. ``If
the regulations aren't changed,'' he said, ``new services will only be
available to the affluent.''
</P>
<P>
Although Hundt has now put that issue on the table at the FCC, the
Supreme Court may come to the industry's aid first. The court is
expected to decide soon on the cable industry's challenge to a portion
of the cable law that requires operators to carry local broadcast
stations.
</P>
<P>
This ``must-carry'' requirement has forced cable operators to make
room for broadcasters by bumping some cable-only channels, including
C-SPAN, off their systems. If the court sides with the cable industry,
cable operators would be free to dump broadcast stations they didn't
want, opening many new slots for cable networks.

 EPA Tightens Hazardous Ash Disposal Rules (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Environmental Protection Agency announced Tuesday
that municipal solid waste incinerators that produce hazardous ash
must soon start disposing of it under stringent federal hazardous
waste disposal rules rather than simply dumping it in conventional
landfills.
</P>
<P>
The EPA decision follows an early May Supreme Court ruling that ash
from energy-producing municipal waste plants can be considered
hazardous waste if it is found to contain certain metals or other
toxic substances.
</P>
<P>
Until the court decision, many municipal waste operators considered
the ash from their facilities exempt from classification as hazardous
waste. Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA),
nonhazardous waste can be dumped in any landfill, but hazardous waste
must be disposed of under a more costly process in specially regulated
dumps.
</P>
<P>
The court ruling will become effective within the next week or two.
Some EPA officials had advocated delaying implementation of the
decision, but EPA administrator Carol M. Browner opted for immediate
action.
</P>
<P>
``We stand ready to fully comply with the court's decision, and to
help states and municipalities to implement it,'' Browner said
yesterday in a news release.
</P>
<P>
The EPA announcement applies to approximately 140 municipal
incinerators across the country that produce energy in the
incineration process.
</P>
<P>
EPA is currently drafting rules for operators of those facilities
to test whether their ash is hazardous. Which operators should test
and how frequently they should test have not yet been determined.
</P>
<P>
The EPA is willing to help operators come into compliance with the
resource conservation law, the agency announced yesterday. An
implementation strategy and a Federal Register notice about the
subject will be issued shortly, the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
EPA is ``willing to engage in discussions with all interested
parties about alternative management schemes . . . for ash,'' the
announcement added.
</P>
<P>
The ruling could require operators to ship hazardous waste over
long distances. For example, municipal waste facility operators in New
Hampshire have determined that their closest options for disposing of
hazardous waste are in New York or Alabama, according to an EPA
official.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court case involved a Chicago incinerator that burns
garbage, producing over 100,000 tons of ash annually and otherwise
producing energy for use in the city. The Environmental Defense Fund
(EDF) sued the city, saying that it violated the resource conservation
law by disposing of the ash in landfills that were not allowed to
receive hazardous waste.
</P>
<P>
``We're pleased that the EPA is enforcing the decision,'' said EDF
attorney Karen Florini. But the agency should do more to regulate the
ash from incinerators that is not necessarily deemed hazardous, she
added.
</P>
<P>
The ruling will probably lead to increased recycling in some areas,
according to some environmentalists, since some cities will make
special efforts to remove metals, batteries or other potentially
hazardous materials from their waste.

 Mandela Speech Aims for Hope to Poor, Reassurance to Rich (Capetown) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
CAPE TOWN, South Africa
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Setting the tone for his presidency
Tuesday, Nelson Mandela tried to give hope to South Africa's poor and
reassurance to its rich.
</P>
<P>
The 45-minute speech to the initial joint session of country's
first democratically elected Parliament laid out the broad goals of
the multi-party, Government of National Unity that he leads. Those
goals follow closely the ideas of the platform of the African National
Congress, or ANC, known as the Reconstruction and Development Program.
</P>
<P>
The program is aimed at providing the impoverished majority black
population of South Africa with the same opportunities afforded the
country's small minority of whites during the four decades of
apartheid. It focuses on building additional housing, on expanded
electrification, and on providing water, health services and
compulsory, free education.
</P>
<P>
He committed the government to spending about $750 million on that
program in the coming fiscal year, a figure set to rise to over $3
billion in the last year of the five-year life of this government -- 
for a total of over $11 billion.
</P>
<P>
To get it off the ground, Mandela borrowed the first 100-days time
frame from Frankin Roosevelt's New Deal package of legislation during
America's Great Depression. He said that within the next three months
he would personally supervise programs to guarantee free health care
to children under the age of 6 and pregnant mothers and implement
nutrition in primary schools.
</P>
<P>
He also said that plans are under way to electrify 350,000 homes
during the current fiscal year, a start on his campaign promise to
bring electricity to 2.5 million homes in the next five years.
Currently, two-thirds of South Africa's 40 million people live without
electricity.
</P>
<P>
The speech continued the theme of reconciliation he has used since
his release from prison four years ago and emphasized since he got 62
percent of the vote last month. This time, he did not reach just over
racial, cultural and political divides, but also over economic ones as
he sought to reassure the business community, middle-class taxpayers
and overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
He promised to achieve his reconstruction goals while also lowering
the country's budget deficit. And, though he did not say ``no new
taxes,'' he did say, ``We are agreed that a permanently higher general
level of taxation is to be avoided.''
</P>
<P>
Sounding far from the revolutionary who spent 27 years in prison on
treason charges, Mandela talked of a stable monetary policy, of
keeping inflation down, encouraging domestic savings to fund
investment, and opening trade negotiations with a variety of partners.
</P>
<P>
As with such state of the union speeches by U.S. presidents,
Mandela's talk contained something for just about everyone, with the
details to follow next month when the budget is unveiled.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Derek Keyes, the blunt finance minister who
retained the portfolio he held in the previous National Party Cabinet,
told a news briefing that the budget will be able to meet Mandela's
promises.
</P>
<P>
``We have a carefully planned five-year program,'' Keyes said.
</P>
<P>
``We are not talking about new revenues, but about re-directing the
current level of spending,'' he said, pointing out that the $750
million figure represents 3 percent of the total budget, about the
amount that could be saved via yearly attrition of the bloated public
service core whose jobs are guaranteed in the new constitution.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Mandela's theme of reconciliation included an amnesty plan for
those involved in political violence.
</P>
<P>
``The government will not delay unduly with regard to attending to
the vexed and unresolved issue of an amnesty for criminal activities
carried out in furtherance of political objectives,'' he said of the
plan to end the hunt for those responsible for the brutalities of
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
``We will attend to this matter in a balanced and dignified way,''
he said. ``The nation must come to terms with its past in a spirit of
openness and forgiveness and proceed to build the future on the basis
of repairing and healing.''
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
He spoke of other policies, mentioning alternatives to
incarceration for youthful offenders, backing women's rights, and
assuring the police and armed forces of the government's faith in
them.
</P>
<P>
But the biggest applause came when Mandela called for a change in
attitude among South Africans.
</P>
<P>
``We must end racism in the workplace as part of our common
offensive against racism in general,'' he said, and then listed the
terms that have been a daily reality for the country's non-white
majority. ``No more should words like kaffirs, hottentost, coolies,
boy, girl and baas be part of our vocabulary.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional Add End)
</P>
<P>
The speech came after a ceremonial opening of the session,
including a 21-gun salute and a flyover by air force jets. Thousands
of Cape Town residents lined the city's streets, hoping to catch a
glimpse of their new president as he made his way to the Parliament
buildings.

 Clinton to Make House Call for Health Plan (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Clinton goes to Capitol Hill Wednesday to
ask nervous Democrats not to bend to interest group pressure in their
home districts or make specific pledges that would gut the
administration health care bill.
</P>
<P>
Worried that small business and other lobbies will use the 12-day
Memorial Day break, starting Friday, to extract promises from members
to oppose requirements that employers pay for their employees'
insurance and other key features of the Clinton plan, the president
will, according to a spokesman, ``remind everyone why we're in this
battle together and why we have to stay the course together.''
</P>
<P>
He will meet first with Democratic congressional leaders and
committee chairmen, then address a caucus of all House Democrats.
</P>
<P>
``We want him to ask the members to keep their powder dry, so they
don't get locked into positions that would make it even more difficult
to pass a bill,'' said Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., a member of the House
leadership's health care team.
</P>
<P>
As Clinton attempted to keep Democrats in line, Senate Minority
Leader Robert J. Dole, R-Kan., prepared to seek Republican support for
new stripped-down health legislation drafted by minority staff members
that could be a starting point for negotiations with Democrats.
</P>
<P>
The partial plan, which has gone through 30 revisions by Sheila P.
Burke, Dole's chief of staff, rejects most of the key elements of the
Clinton plan, including the requirement that employers pay for much of
the cost of their employees' health insurance and that consumers buy
insurance through mandatory state-run purchasing alliances.
</P>
<P>
Burke said it is still an open question whether Dole will advocate
a requirement that all Americans who lack health insurance buy their
own -- as they are required to do with auto insurance.
</P>
<P>
According to a draft of the plan Dole will use in his discussions
Wednesday, he seeks to require all health plans to offer a minimum
package of benefits, something not now required.
</P>
<P>
The draft document suggests the benefits package should be worth 75
percent of the value of the standard package offered to federal
employees.
</P>
<P>
Dole also will try to get Republicans to agree to prohibit insurers
from denying coverage to people when they change jobs and on tough
limits to medical malpractice suits. He will suggest providing
subsidies to low-income people to buy insurance only when new federal
money becomes available, but would impose a ``fail-safe'' mechanism to
make sure future Medicare and Medicaid spending does not go above
projections.
</P>
<P>
Both the Republican and Democratic sessions come at a critical
point in the legislative work on the ambitious health plan Clinton
promised in his 1992 campaign and launched last September. The White
House had hoped various versions of the Clinton bill would emerge by
the Memorial Day break from at least some of the five committees -- 
three in the House and two in the Senate -- with major jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
One Senate committee and two House subcommittees have begun work on
the measure, but no full committee has finished work on a proposal.
Administration and Capitol Hill officials now have set July 1 as the
``final'' target date for getting bills out of committee, so the
legislation can be considered on the floor of both bodies before the
Aug. 15 summer vacation.
</P>
<P>
When Congress returns in September, it will have barely a month
before adjournment and the closing phase of midterm election campaigns
to get final agreement on a measure.
</P>
<P>
One reason for the slow pace has been the effective lobbying and
advertising campaigns by groups representing health insurance, small
business and others who object to major features of the Clinton plan.
``No question,'' said Synar, ``a major reason we want the president up
here is that we expect to see a tremendous amount of special-interest
activity, focused on the members, while we're at home. We want the
president to prepare people for that and to tell them that he is ready
to address whatever concerns they hear when they're home.''
</P>
<P>
At the last congressional break, over the Easter holidays, platoons
of administration officials joined Democratic lawmakers in forums
trying to sell constituents on the Clinton plan. The White House has
prepared a 53-page handbook of suggested events members can stage
during the coming recess as forums for voicing arguments for the
Clinton plan. But this time, the effort is essentially defensive -- to
avoid further erosion of support.

 $1.6 Billion at Risk as S L Suits Thwarted, Regulators Say (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the mid-1980s, John Henderson Jr. had his Texas
thrifts buy two airplanes for more than $1 million each so he could
fly between his offices and his ranch. The thrifts also bought a
$30,000 Mercedes and a $75,000 BMW for his use -- and a van for his
maid, according to court testimony.
</P>
<P>
This April, a Tyler, Texas, jury said Henderson was guilty of gross
negligence and breach of his duties as the president and chairman of
both Southland and Home savings and loan associations, and that he
should pay the U.S. Treasury $7 million in damages. The 1988 failure
of the two S Ls cost taxpayers more than $100 million.
</P>
<P>
But Henderson got a reprieve. He doesn't have to pay the $7 million
because the state deadline for gross-negligence claims expired even
before federal regulators took over the thrift. The courts rejected
the government's argument that the statute of limitations should be
waived because when the board of directors is handpicked by the
thrift's chairman -- as in the case of Southland and Home -- it is
unlikely to sue him.
</P>
<P>
Federal bank and thrift regulators say $1.6 billion in claims
already brought against directors, officers, lawyers, accountants and
other professionals who served failed banks and S Ls in Texas and
Virginia are at risk because of recent court rulings on the deadline
for bringing lawsuits. And they fear billions of dollars more in
claims could be in jeopardy if other states set time limits on such
cases.
</P>
<P>
Both the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Resolution Trust
Corp. have asked Congress to pass legislation to cure what they see as
flaws in state laws. The legislation would allow the government to
base claims on activities as far back as five years prior to the
takeover of an institution, which would revive some claims that had
expired under state laws.
</P>
<P>
But Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, powerful head of the House Judiciary
Committee, is opposed to the measure. The legislative change,
contained in an amendment to the Interstate Banking Bill that passed
both houses in April, is headed to a conference committee. Brooks and
other members of the Judiciary Committee are among the conferees.
</P>
<P>
FDIC congressional liaison Alice Goodman said Brooks' aides on the
Judiciary Committee told her that they knew his position on the
amendment and that she should not bother to brief them on the issue.
``They indicated he probably would not be supporting this,'' Goodman
said.
</P>
<P>
``Offhand, I'd say it's a very dangerous amendment, and (the
conferees) ought to take a very hard look at it,'' Brooks said. ``It's
a retroactive law. It might be unconstitutional.''
</P>
<P>
Brooks, who in the past owned substantial stock in Texas S Ls that
later failed, is currently a director and shareholder of three Texas
banks.
</P>
<P>
In response to inquiries to his office, Brooks said he may decide
to recuse himself from the conference because of his bank
directorships.
</P>
<P>
Many of the most egregious examples of negligence at savings and
loans were seen in Texas, according to the National Commission on
Financial Institution Reform, a panel of experts appointed by Congress
to study the thrift debacle. It said ``40 percent of all taxpayer
losses came from Texas S Ls.''
</P>
<P>
If the Texas court decisions regarding statutes of limitation
stand, government lawyers will have to focus their efforts in other
states to recover taxpayer losses, according to the regulators.
</P>
<P>
``In other jurisdictions, directors could be (successfully) sued
for the same things, while directors in Virginia and Texas would walk
away,'' said John V. Thomas, head of the FDIC's professional-liability
section. ``It seems unreasonable and unfair.''
</P>
<P>
``We might as well shut down the professional-liability section if
other states adopt the Texas or Virginia rules,'' said Jack D. Smith,
the FDIC's deputy general counsel.
</P>
<P>
Untold millions of dollars from cases not yet brought are in
jeopardy. Among the potential claims that could be affected are those
that may arise from the investigation of Madison Guaranty Savings and
Loan in Arkansas. Special Counsel Robert Fiske is examining Madison's
activities for civil claims as well as criminal violations. Fiske is
investigating President Clinton's and Hillary Rodham Clinton's ties to
the S L. Neither was a director of the bank, but Hillary Clinton was
an attorney for the thrift.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, proposed the amendment that
would give federal regulators more time to file cases, regardless of
state statutes.
</P>
<P>
``For us to sit by and do nothing while the courts are wiping out
millions of dollars in decisions would be an absurdity,'' Metzenbaum
said.
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the argument are those who say it is unfair to
paint all S L directors with the same brush.
</P>
<P>
``You reach a point where the equities say that some guilty people
are going to slip through the net,'' said J. Jonathan Schraub, a
lawyer for some directors of failed Trustbank Savings FSB of Virginia.
``Overall, this industry wasn't populated by fools and crooks. ...
There were a lot of innocent, honest people in that business.''
</P>
<P>
The issue comes at a crucial time for such recoveries, according to
federal officials. The six-month period ended March 31 was the most
productive in the four and a half years of the RTC's
professional-liability section, with $405 million in claims recovered,
according to an agency report.
</P>
<P>
But courts in Virginia and Texas have dismissed 12 cases with
claims of $93 million because of recent appeals-court decisions in the
two states.
</P>
<P>
``I think the amendment is unfair, and it's especially unfair to
use this case as an example,'' said Thomas H. Walston, an attorney for
Henderson. ``Mr. Henderson had given his entire life to Home
Savings.''
</P>
<P>
Henderson, who helped found the S L in 1955 and was a majority
shareholder, lost much of his wealth when the thrift failed in 1988,
Walston said. Henderson denied at trial that the planes and cars
purchased by the S Ls were for his use alone and said they were
necessary to do business -- a contention the jury rejected.

 Supreme Court Asked to Throw Out Ruling on Demjanjuk (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Justice Department Tuesday asked the Supreme Court
to throw out a federal appeals-court ruling that prosecutors committed
fraud by witholding evidence that favored alleged Nazi death-camp
guard John Demjanjuk.
</P>
<P>
If the petition is successful, it could clear the way for the
United States to deport the retired Cleveland auto worker. When the
6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found that fraud had occurred, it
voided an earlier extradition authorization.
</P>
<P>
In its filing Tuesday, the Justice Department said prosecutors
involved in the effort to deport Demjanjuk acted in good faith and
that the failure to produce certain documents did not rise to the
level of ``egregious and deliberate misconduct, such as bribery of a
judge or fabrication of evidence'' that typically is found to be a
fraud upon a court.
</P>
<P>
``The standard adopted by the court of appeals in this case is
inconsistent with standards articulated by the overwhelming majority
of the courts of appeals,'' said the brief signed by Solicitor General
Drew S. Days III.
</P>
<P>
The government is seeking to vindicate prosecutors' actions as well
as to remove a cloud over the validity of an earlier court judgment
that Demjanjuk should be stripped of his U.S. citizenship and
deported.
</P>
<P>
Demjanjuk, who was extradited in 1986, was convicted and sentenced
to death for torturing and murdering Jews at the Treblinka
concentration camp in Poland during World War II. He was allegedly the
notorious ``Ivan the Terrible.''
</P>
<P>
But last year the Israeli Supreme Court overturned the conviction,
saying there was insufficient proof that he was Ivan, and Demjanjuk
was allowed to return home in September.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the 6th circuit court had appointed a trial judge
to investigate the Justice Department's handling of the deportation.
The appeals court ultimately concluded last year that prosecutors had
defrauded the court by withholding information that Demjanjuk could
have used to contest the extradition.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department contends that Demjanjuk still should be
deported because of his activities at camps other than Treblinka. The
6th circuit's finding of fraud ``will hinder the government's efforts
to remove (Demjanjuk) from the United States,'' Days told the
justices.

 May Massacre Hits 40 IBM Advertising Agencies (New York) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In perhaps the biggest shift in advertising history, IBM
stunned and angered much of Madison Avenue Tuesday by firing more than
40 ad agencies around the world and shifting more than $400 million in
annual advertising to one agency, Ogilvy Mather.
</P>
<P>
The dramatic announcement reflects efforts under Chairman Louis V.
Gerstner Jr. to radically overhaul -- and in many cases simplify -- 
IBM's vast and cumbersome structure as well as put new life into its
once powerful but increasingly blurred brand image.
</P>
<P>
``Ogilvy Mather will help us deliver clear, consistent messages -- 
and in the most efficient way possible,'' said Abby F. Kohnstamm, the
giant computer company's vice president for corporate marketing. She
had helped lead the secretive search for a new agency over the past
several months and got to know Ogilvy when she was at American
Express. Gerstner, a former American Express president, brought her
over to IBM.
</P>
<P>
But while there are big advantages to improving coordination, there
are also dangers to shrinking the roster of agencies, said Alan
Gottesman, media analyst at brokerage firm PaineWebber Co. ``If you
get it wrong, you get it wrong everywhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The fallout from the IBM announcement is widespread. In order to
avoid conflicts with IBM, Ogilvy -- whose accounts also include
American Express, Jaguar and Duracell -- is dropping two other
computer-related clients representing a total of $100 million in
billings. They are Microsoft, the nation's biggest software company,
and Compaq, whose ads Ogilivy does in Europe. Ogilvy, with $5.8
billion in billings, 270 offices and 7,000 employees in 59 countries,
did not work for IBM before.
</P>
<P>
``To get this assignment is the best chance we will ever have to
practice helping a brand like IBM at a critical juncture in the
brand's life,'' said Ogilvy Chairman Charlotte Beers.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
The biggest losers Tuesday ranged from Lintas and Wells Rich
Greene, two large agencies already reeling from the loss of other big
accounts, to Merkley Newman Hartley, a small, 1-year-old agency that
was the surprise winner of the account for IBM personal computers just
last November.
</P>
<P>
``I understand the logic,'' said Kenneth S. Olshan, chairman of
Wells Rich, whose image and billings have dropped sharply in recent
years. ``From a strictly administrative point of view it's very neat
and tidy. But in my mind it views advertising as a commodity, and
that's what is upsetting about it.''
</P>
<P>
Lintas lost the IBM personal computer account last year, when it
also lost the Diet Coke account.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
When IBM introduced its personal computer in 1981, it used a very
effective depiction of Charlie Chaplin's Little Tramp produced by
Lord, Geller, Federico Einstein. But when that agency fell apart, IBM
spread out its accounts, saying it was too dangerous for a huge
company to depend so much on one agency.

 Talks Over Rosty's Fate Continue (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Negotiations about the fate of Rep. Dan Rostenkowski,
D-Ill., continued Tuesday at a heated pitch with federal prosecutors
and defense attorneys still unable to reach an agreement. Meanwhile,
some House Republicans said they would call for hearings if the
powerful Ways and Means Committee chairman received what they
considered too lenient a deal.
</P>
<P>
The options being discussed include resignation, a guilty plea to a
felony and jail time by Rostenkowski, sources said Tuesday. Although
defense attorneys have indicated that there may be room for
compromise, a number of factors have kept a deal from being set,
particularly the question of jail time.
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski is said to be adamantly opposed to spending any time
in prison and much of the haggling appears to revolve around that
issue, said one source knowledgeable of the deliberations.
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys were publicly silent Tuesday on the matter, as
were prosecutors who had set this week as the point to seek an
indictment of Rostenkowski.
</P>
<P>
However, politicians on Capitol Hill were offering their opinions
in increasing numbers, including House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich,
R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
``Any plea bargain that was below some minimum standard would
automatically'' lead to Republicans calling for House Judiciary
Committee hearings, wire reports chronicled Gingrich as saying.
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors have outlined a broad conspiracy to defraud the
government case against Rostenkowski, including charges that the
veteran lawmaker paid employees for work not done, and that he abused
official accounts for leased cars, office supplies and office space.
He has publicly denied all the charges.

 Northern Yemeni Troops Seize Oil-Field Center (Mukalla, Yemen) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MUKALLA, Yemen
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Troops of northern Yemen have seized the military
base at Ataq, in southern Yemen, gaining control of key access routes
to the warring country's chief economic resource, a potentially
lucrative oil field near the border with Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Ali Salem Beidh, leader of southern forces in the
3-week-old civil war, acknowledged the advances by troops of President
Ali Abdallah Salih, the northern leader, in a news conference late
Sunday with foreign journalists flown to this oil shipping port 300
miles east of Aden, the chief southern city.
</P>
<P>
Beidh and other southern officials said the northern army passed
through the ancient city of Marib, and then moved 75 miles through the
oil-producing province of Shabwah to seize Ataq, its capital.
</P>
<P>
Control of the Shabwah oil fields could determine who will be
master of a region that represents the economic future of Yemen. The
country once hoped to be the first working democracy in the Arabian
Peninsula, but it has been in political disarray since shortly after
its formation four years ago by the merger of conservative Muslim
North Yemen and Marxist South Yemen.
</P>
<P>
The Shabwah oil fields now account for only a small portion of
Yemen's production -- about 5,000 barrels a day -- but oil specialists
say they contain reserves estimated at 5 billion barrels. The Saudi
oil company Nimr, the French Total and Canadian Occidental have
oil-prospecting concessions there.
</P>
<P>
Phil Davies, the administrator at Canadian Occidental's oil-loading
terminal on the coast just east of here, said his company has not yet
experienced any difficulties because of the war, which broke out May
4.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Occidental is pumping 150,000 barrels a day from the
Masila oil field in Hadramout Province, east of Shabwah. Davies said
it appeared unlikely that the fighting, still more than 80 miles west
of the major oil fields, will affect the work of his company, which
has investments here of $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
Northern Yemen, however, warned foreign airlines and shipping
companies Monday to stay clear of southern airports and seaports,
saying they would be exposed to danger if they tried to land or dock
at southern facilities.
</P>
<P>
Beidh declared a Republic of Democratic Yemen in the south last
Saturday and has moved his leadership to Mukalla. Beidh is serving as
president of the breakaway government, and Haidar Abu Bakr Attas, a
southerner who was federal prime minister, has joined it.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said Monday
that the United States would not recognize the breakup and ``does not
believe the critical issues which will shape the future of Yemen
should be decided in the heat of battle.''
</P>
<P>
The conflict between Yemen's northern and southern leaderships has
settled into a fight over distribution of the country's oil income,
its ultimate political and social structure, and the patronage and
shifting loyalties of its heavily armed tribes.
</P>
<P>
``The military situation is worse than we thought. They have come
from Marib and taken Ataq and Nuqbah. We are trying to regroup to
organize the tribes,'' said Mohsen Mohammed bin Farid, U.S.-educated
secretary general of the Sons of Yemen League, which has thrown its
support behind Beidh in an effort to fend off the offensive from the
north.

 Arms Embargo Vote Delayed by House (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The House Tuesday decided that if it could not speak
with two voices about the international arms embargo of Bosnia, it
would rather say nothing at all about the foreign policy issue for two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Senate recently approved two contradictory resolutions on
ending the arms embargo, either unilaterally or with support from
other nations. Until the Clinton administration intervened, the House
was set to vote on two similar amendments to a $263 billion defense
bill, under a procedure that allows lawmakers to support both.
</P>
<P>
But House leaders postponed the votes until June 9 because
officials concluded the administration-opposed amendment calling for
President Clinton to lift the embargo unilaterally was likely to pass,
while the administration-backed one urging the president to seek
multilateral action to suspend or limit the embargo was headed for
defeat.
</P>
<P>
That outcome was likely even though the floor procedure favored the
administration-backed amendment.
</P>
<P>
Administration officials also successfully argued that the House
would appear to be dictating Bosnia policy to Clinton and constraining
his options just days before he visits Europe with the opportunity to
persuade allied nations to join in lifting the arms embargo.
</P>
<P>
Rep. Frank McCloskey, D-Ind., and other advocates of ending the
U.S. arms embargo on the embattled republic maintained a House vote
for unilateral action would have helped Clinton next week in his talks
with European leaders.
</P>
<P>
``I was getting very good feedback that the McCloskey amendment
would have passed today . . . and very well reinforced President
Clinton in dealing with the allies,'' McCloskey said.
</P>
<P>
Asked how a House vote requiring the president to end the embargo
unilaterally would have helped Clinton with the allies, given the
Senate's ambivalent stance, House Democratic Caucus Chairman Steny H.
Hoyer, D-Md., replied, ``I think it makes it clearer than if we say
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
Clinton fared better in his lobbying against a proposal to scale
back production of the C-17, which he reminded the House carries
economic punch as well as military cargo. Lawmakers approved, 330 to
100, an amendment to maintain production at six planes next year
instead of cutting the number to four as the defense bill stipulated.
</P>
<P>
The vote was so lopsided that Rep. Elizabeth Furse, D-Ore., dropped
her proposed amendment to terminate C-17 production after next year.
</P>
<P>
In a letter circulated to House members, Clinton advised that
cutting production by two planes would ``cause at least 8,000 layoffs
over the next two years'' and increase the cost per plane by $40
million to $50 million.
</P>
<P>
Economic interests in maintaining C-17 production at current levels
were apparent throughout the House debate. About 10,000 McDonnell
Douglas Corp. employees build the planes in Long Beach, Calif., and
leading sponsors of the successful amendment included Rep. Steve Horn,
R-Calif., and Rep. Jane Harman, D-Calif. Horn is from Long Beach,
while Harman represents nearby Los Angeles suburbs.

 Mandela Outlines His Plan for First 100 Days (Cape Town) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
CAPE TOWN, South Africa
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two weeks after a negotiated revolution
swept him into power as this country's first black president, Nelson
Mandela laid out his vision for the new era Tuesday with a promise to
create jobs and ease the wretched conditions in which most blacks
live.
</P>
<P>
But first, the economy must grow and nervous investors must be
reassured, Mandela, who helped create a black guerrilla movement 32
years ago to fight white minority rule, said in a State of the Nation
speech in the new all-race Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Mandela outlined an immediate, First-100-Days plan that provides
free medical care for impoverished infants, nutritious meals for the
poorest schoolchildren, electrification of thousands of rural homes
and a public works program to create jobs instantly.
</P>
<P>
In defining where the country is headed in the next five years of
interim black-white coalition rule, Mandela employed the staid
language of international finance and of lecture hall economists.
Sometimes whole chunks of his speech seemed to have been written by
international trickle-down theorists.
</P>
<P>
``In support of sustainable economic growth and the macro-economic
objectives of government, it will remain the primary objective of
monetary policy to promote and maintain overall financial stability,''
Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
Gone was the populist rhetoric of the early days of the campaign
for the presidency, when ``amaQabane'' (``comrades'' in both the Zulu
and Xhosa languages) talked of wealth redistribution and original
African National Congress policy documents spoke of nationalization of
diamond mines controlled by whites. Now, the euphoria of their
election victory is quickly giving way to the less exalted and
entirely boring nuts-and-bolts reality of governing.
</P>
<P>
Life is by no means business-as-usual in the new South Africa. The
mere focus of a presidential speech on black needs is unheard of in
the country's history.
</P>
<P>
But white Finance Minister Derek Keys is staying on in his job, as
is the governor of the reserve bank, Chris Stals. Their retention by
Mandela is meant to signal nervous white business leaders, who have
been stashing their money abroad to keep it out of the reach of the
new black government, that the country will be kept safe for capital.
Last week, when an ANC-aligned economist said the new government's
Reconstruction and Development Program will carry more than twice its
previously estimated price tag of $11 billion, the Johannesburg Stock
Exchange went into a mild panic.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday the leftist labor leader Jay Naidoo, appointed by Mandela
to coordinate the reconstruction effort in devastated black
communities, said: ``We need to maintain fiscal discipline. We need to
contain inflation. Those are universal principles of a modern
economy.''
</P>
<P>
The soothing noises and economic obfuscation may be necessary, said
some of even the most left-wing of the previously left-leaning ANC.
The new administration, said communist leader Ronnie Kasrils, needs to
create elbow room for itself so that the most urgent needs of blacks
can be attended to right away without scaring whites.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
``I think at this point in time he (Mandela) is trying to soothe
the nerves of the old regime -- I'm not saying he has to,'' said
Kasrils, a member of Parliament. ``At the same time, there are
sufficient signals to show our people that we are immediately moving
to take action on their part.''
</P>
<P>
Mandela said that the First-100-Days plan will be carried out
``within the context of a policy aimed at building a strong and
growing economy.''
</P>
<P>
His trade minister, the ANC's Trevor Manuel, pleaded for
understanding, saying that if the president didn't make conciliatory
gestures now, he never would once blacks began to consolidate power.
</P>
<P>
``This is not the time or place'' for revolutionary talk, Manuel
said.

 Republican Christian Bookstore Owner Takes Lead in Contest to Fill 
 Kentucky Seat Held by Rep. Natcher 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what has the makings of another setback for President Clinton
and the Democratic Party, Republican Christian bookstore owner Ron
Lewis took an early lead in the bitter contest to fill the Kentucky
seat held by Rep. William H. Natcher, the Democratic incumbent who
died earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The Lewis campaign, which had been considered a longshot, sought to
turn the contest into a referendum on the Clinton administration in
the traditionally Democratic, but deeply conservative, 2nd
Congressional District of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
Backed with $200,000 from national GOP committees, Lewis charged
that Joe Prather, the Democratic nominee, was cut from the same mold
as Clinton. His TV commericals repeated over and over again:
``Kentucky doesn't need Joe Prather. Send a message to Bill Clinton.
Send Ron Lewis to Congress. Ron Lewis, he's one of us.''
</P>
<P>
The results in the Kentucky contest will help determine how much
Democratic House candidates in tough elections, expecially those in
southern districts, seek to distance themselves from the Clinton
administration. Republicans are already touting the victory of Frank
Lukas in a once rock-solid Democratic district in Oklahoma in a
contest earlier this month to replace Rep. Glen English, D-Okla.
</P>
<P>
It is also a worry for Democrats that they could have a hard time
holding on to some of the seats being vacated by longtime incumbents.

 Fox: NFL Contract Key to New Affiliates (New York) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The chairman of the Fox Broadcasting Co. said Tuesday
that the defection of eight CBS affiliate stations to her network was
directly attributable to Fox's December acquisition of broadcast
rights to National Football League games over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
``These CBS stations were not real happy that CBS lost the NFL;
that was a big, big blow to them,'' Lucie Salhany, the chairman of Fox
said Tuesday in an interview here at a media luncheon attended by
several Fox football executives and announcers. ``The NFL was critical
to this deal.''
</P>
<P>
Monday, Fox announced it had invested $500 million to buy 20
percent of New World Communciations Group Inc. New World owns CBS
stations in Detroit, Cleveland, Atlanta, Tampa and Milwaukee, all of
which will switch to Fox.
</P>
<P>
New World is buying another seven stations in Dallas; Kansas City,
Mo.; Phoenix; St. Louis; Greensboro, N.C.; Birmingham, and Austin,
Texas, and those seven will switch to Fox. Three are currently ABC
stations, one is an NBC affiliate.
</P>
<P>
All 12 stations are on the more powerful VHF dial and are expected
to switch to Fox programming within six months. On Dec. 17, Fox
stunned CBS by outbidding the NFL's long-time network for the rights
to televise the league over the next four seasons. Fox paid $1.58
billion -- $395 million for each year of the contract -- for the rights
to carry National Football Conference games.
</P>
<P>
The deal with New World means 10 of the 14 NFC cities will have Fox
owned and operated stations.
</P>
<P>
The addition of the 12 stations also gives Fox penetration to 97
percent of the country, up from 92 percent when it was awarded the NFC
rights by the NFL. Salhany said Tuesday that within the next two
weeks, Fox will announce the addition of several more stations, all on
the VHF band of channels 2 through 13.
</P>
<P>
She also indicated that Fox was very interested in acquiring other
sports properties and will make a serious bid for the 2000 Summer
Olympics in Sydney. The network's parent company, Fox Inc., is owned
by Australian-born media magnate Rupert Murdoch, now a U.S. citizen.
Its sports division is headed by another Australian, David Hill.
</P>
<P>
Hill and other Fox Sports people were ebullient over the addition
of the former CBS affiliates, as was the NFL. ``We're tickled that
everything this network committed to the NFL has happened,'' Hill
said. ``It's easy to say it all, but step by step we're proving to the
NFL and our viewers we're delivering everything we've promised. This
is another brick in the wall.''
</P>
<P>
Val Pinchbeck, vice president of broadcasting for the NFL, said one
of the league's initial concerns with Fox was its ability to provide
the same sort of strong signal and blanket coverage CBS delivered for
30 years.
</P>
<P>
``This is another giant step forward in that whole area,'' he said
Tuesday. ``They didn't talk specifically to us in December about this
exact deal. But they indicated they would replicate the CBS coverage.
This also goes beyond sports. In major markets, it gives you a
stronger VHF station with better penetration.''
</P>
<P>
Over at CBS Sports, the reaction was predictably muted. ``I was
stunned to hear about it,'' said David Kenin, the new president of CBS
Sports, ``and who knows if anything else will happen, if there will be
regulatory review. But I just told our people our goal is to do our
rights deals, produce our programming, handle talent, sales and
affiliate issues and not focus on anything but our own business. ...

 U.S. Ships Fire at Vessels Running Embargo (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Navy ships enforcing expanded United Nations
sanctions against Haiti have fired warning shots at two vessels
running the embargo and intercepted one of them, Pentagon officials
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that gasoline and other vital products continue to
enter Haiti, mostly from the Dominican Republic, Clinton
administration officials said they are combining political pressure on
the Dominican Republic with an increase in seaborne patrols to try to
halt the commerce.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton's special envoy for Haiti, William Gray, is going
to the Dominican Republic Wednesday to seek President Joaquin
Balaguer's cooperation in closing the land border and shutting down
seaborne traffic, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
With the dispatch of two more U.S. Navy ships to the area Tuesday,
the armada patrolling the Haitian coast has grown to ten -- eight from
the United States, one from Canada and one from Argentina, Pentagon
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Navy has been authorized to fire ``disabling'' shots as well as
warnings, and is free to operate inside Haitian territorial waters to
block nautical traffic into Haiti, said Pentagon spokesman Dennis
Boxx.
</P>
<P>
According to Boxx and Navy officials, the first shooting incident
occurred Sunday when a Bahamian-registered seagoing tug named the Sea
Search ignored instructions to stop. A Navy ship fired warning shots,
but the tug fled toward shore.
</P>
<P>
A brief squall then hid the tug from view briefly. By the time the
U.S. crew spotted it again, the tug was only 800 yards from shore.
With other ships and small boats in the area, ``it would have been too
dangerous to fire'' disabling shots, a Navy official said.
</P>
<P>
In the second incident, late Monday, a Navy frigate, the Antrim,
``encountered a Panamanian-flagged ship, the Leonese, off the north
coast of Haiti,'' Boxx said. The Antrim ``ordered the ship to lay to.
It did not.'' The Antrim then ``fired ten 50-caliber warning shots
across the bow, and that ship did lay to.''
</P>
<P>
A Coast Guard crew searched the Leonese Tuesday, but a Navy
spokesman said the results were not known by Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The tighter U.N. sanctions, prohibiting all shipments to Haiti
other than food and medicine, took effect Sunday. Since then, Boxx
said, 14 ships heading for Haiti have been ``diverted'' and nine
cleared to proceed. Even those that are cleared have their fuel tanks
measured on the way in and again on the way out to ensure that they
are not selling the contents on shore, a Navy spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
A three-member team sent by the United Nations, including a U.S.
customs agent, is inspecting the Dominican republic-Haiti border this
week to determine what kinds of controls would be needed to stop the
flow of goods across it.
</P>
<P>
``We're trying to figure out what you could do with a cooperative
(Dominican) government,'' one U.S. official said. ``Will they
cooperate, and if so, what do we want them to do? We have thought in
terms of people who would be acceptable to the Dominican government,''
rather than a military force that would seal the border against
Balaguer's wishes, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jacinto Peynado, who was elected vice president on Balaguer's
ticket in the Dominican Republic's May 16 elections, said in
Washington Tuesday that his country lacks the resources, and perhaps
the will, to seal the border.
</P>
<P>
``Even the United States, with all its resources, cannot control
the border with Mexico,'' he said. ``How can we be expected to seal a
frontier that is mountainous and desolate?''
</P>
<P>
He said the purpose of the embargo -- forcing Haiti's military
rulers to step aside and allow the return of ousted president
Jean-Bertrand Aristide -- is of no concern to the Dominican Republic.
``Whether Aristide comes or goes is a matter for the Haitians,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
Even as the Navy tries to halt the flow of goods into Haiti, a
flotilla of another sort is being assembled to deal with the flow of
Haitians out of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon announced Tuesday that the 1,000-berth hospital ship
Comfort has been deployed to the Caribbean for possible use as a
migrant processing center. It will supplement two Ukranian cruise
ships already chartered to serve in the refugee effort. Additionally,
the State Department began hiring 100 to 200 new employes to assist in
processing Haitian refugees.
</P>
<P>
But the administration's search for a place in the Caribbean to put
the ships literally hit a reef. Having moved closer to getting British
permission to station the ships in the Turks and Caicos Islands,
administration officials said Tuesday they were having trouble finding
a suitable spot for the big ships to anchor amid the 30 small,
coral-strewn islands.
</P>
<P>
Initially the administration hoped to find enough sheltered water
in the Turks and Caicos to station a floating refugee camp. But, a
senior administration official said, it does not appear that the Turks
and Caicos, which are a British dependency, offer a safe place for
such a setup.
</P>
<P>
Anticipating that the Turks and Caicos will not be suitable, the
administration has begun talks with Jamaica about setting up a
processing center there, officials said. Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott is scheduled to visit Jamaica next week, a State
Department official said.
</P>
<P>
On Capitol Hill Tuesday, House members approved, 223 to 201, a
nonbinding resolution offered by Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., urging
joint action with the Organization of American States and United
Nations to turn the Haitian island of Gonave into a safe haven for
Haitian refugees.
</P>
<P>
The House also rejected, 236 to 191, another resolution sponsored
by House Foreign Affairs Chairman Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., and Armed
Services Chairman Ronald V. Dellums, D-Calif., calling for extending
economic sanctions to commercial air flights and processing Haitian
refugess on land rather than at sea.
</P>
<P>
Asked to explain the meaning of the two votes, Goss said: ``It
basically says the safe haven approach is a whole lot better than
sanctions that are not working.''

 Four World Trade Center Bombers Get Life Without Parole (New York) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shouting their defiance, four Islamic militants were
sentenced Tuesday to life in prison without parole for last year's
bombing of the World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
In imposing the maximum possible punishment for what the government
has termed ``the worst act of terrorism in U.S. history,'' U.S.
District Judge Kevin T. Duffy called the defendants sneaks and
cowards.
</P>
<P>
``What you sought to do in the name of Islam,'' he admonished them,
`` ... violated the laws not only of man, but God.''
</P>
<P>
The noontime explosion on Feb. 26, 1993, killed six people, injured
more than 1,000 and filled the 110-story twin towers with smoke and
flames. It also shattered America's sense of post-Cold War
invulnerability, and the belief that terrorism was an overseas
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
Evidence presented during the trial showed that the defendants had
sought to punish Americans for their support of Israel by targeting
one of the nation's best-known landmarks.
</P>
<P>
``There has been no remorse shown, merely arrogance and nothing
else,'' Duffy said as he sentenced the principal defendant, Mohammed
A. Salameh, 26, who allegedly rented the van that carried the
1,200-pound bomb into the trade center's underground garage. ``Somehow
you have a sense of achievement. Perhaps you feel you are a martyr.''
</P>
<P>
Federal authorities broke the case last year after tracing the
rented van to Salameh through an identification number found on a
piece of debris.
</P>
<P>
``You chose a site to kill the greatest number of people
possible,'' the judge told Salameh. If the bomb had been placed at the
base of the Trade Center's north tower, he observed, ``as many as
10,000 deaths could have resulted.''
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Outside the federal courthouse, where a jury had convicted the
defendants on March 4, dozens of New York police stood behind
barricades to guard against violent demonstrations or perhaps another
bombing attempt. No trouble ensued, and by late afternoon some
officers were slumped over the wooden barricades as if dozing.
</P>
<P>
Salameh, like the other defendants, said in remarks before
sentencing that the months-long jury trial had been infected with bias
because of unfair treatment by ``the media in the United States and
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
He and his accomplices also objected that after firing their
court-appointed lawyers two months ago, Duffy prohibited them from
retaining famed civil rights lawyer William Kunstler to handle their
appeals. Duffy ruled against Kunstler on grounds he already is
representing one or two defendants in a related bombing conspiracy
trial next fall involving a militant Egyptian sheik and a dozen
others.
</P>
<P>
Although the government would like Salameh and two other convicted
bombers to testify at that trial, Salameh told the court in a booming
voice: ``The government wants us to testify falsely in the name of
cooperation. I will not testify in that other case against anyone.''
</P>
<P>
Referring to his own case, he said, ``I am not going to plead for
mercy. I will not beg.''
</P>
<P>
Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, regarded by Salameh and the others as
their spiritual leader, and 12 co-defendants are charged with
conspiring not only to bomb the World Trade Center but also with
plotting to blow up the United Nations building and the Lincoln and
Holland commuter tunnels linking New York City with New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Duffy reserved his harshest condemnation for the second defendant,
Nidal A. Ayyad, 26, a chemical engineer who helped finance the bombing
and ordered chemicals and hydrogen gas for the homemade explosive
device.
</P>
<P>
``You are clearly the most culpable of the defendants. You had the
best breaks,'' Duffy told him, referring to his U.S. college
education.
</P>
<P>
The judge said Ayyad had violated the oath he took upon becoming a
U.S. citizen ``and turned your life into a total lie.''
</P>
<P>
Ayyad also was convicted of sending an anonymous letter to The New
York Times threatening further acts of violence unless the United
States cut off all assistance to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Ayyad responded defiantly to Duffy: ``You are only a judge. You can
put me in prison for five or 10 lives. But God is more powerful than
America.''
</P>
<P>
When Ayyad complained that ``human rights advocates'' had not
monitored his treatment during months in detention, Duffy interjected:
``Did human rights organizations monitor the people whom you killed?''
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
The other two defendants, Mahmud Abouhalima, 34, and Ahmad M. Ajaj,
28, claimed they were victims of American injustice, repeatedly
invoked the name of God, and said they would rely on divine law over
human law.
</P>
<P>
Abouhalima, the oldest of the defendants who was pictured as
``field general'' of the bombing, helped construct the bomb and
purchased gas for the delivery van the morning of the crime. Ajaj was
convicted of carrying bomb-making manuals into the country several
months before the blast.
</P>
<P>
In sentencing each to 240 years in prison, Duffy said 180 years of
the sentence was based on the life expectancy of the six people who
died in the explosion.
</P>
<P>
He also imposed fines of $250,000 on each defendant to be used as
restitution to families of the victims. Federal sources said they did
not know if the fines ever could be collected.

 Ships Openly Defy Sieve-Like Haiti Blockade (Port-au-Prince) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five of them sit at the pier, ships of all
measure, varying from 70 feet to seven times that size. Some fly the
Haitian flag, one the British ensign, and some fly no flags at all.
They all have one thing in common: They defy the world.
</P>
<P>
From the Leo, an anchorless rust bucket recently pulled from the
beach where it had run aground, to the British-flagged Oakleigh, all
have run a U.N. embargo to bring in tens of thousands of gallons of
banned fuel oil.
</P>
<P>
Jacmel, a resort created as a pseudo French seaside village by
early 19th-century coffee magnates, has become the center of the
Haitian military's effort to break the international sanctions
intended to force the army from power.
</P>
<P>
``The border is still a serious problem,'' a diplomat said of the
frontier between Haiti and the Dominican Republic, ``and lots of gas
comes through, but the biggest threat is now the sea.''
</P>
<P>
Under threat is the strategy by the United Nations and the United
States to use a near-total embargo to end military rule and restore
exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was driven from office
Sept. 20, 1991, after seven months as Haiti's only democratically
elected president.
</P>
<P>
``If we can't stop smuggling, especially from the D.R., then the
embargo is not only a failure, it is stupid,'' the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
``Ships come all the time,'' said a foreign resident who has lived
here for more than 20 years. ``They unload barrels of gas, or they
just pump it out into truck tankers, all in plain sight of the
choppers.''
</P>
<P>
The choppers are U.S. naval and Coast Guard helicopters flying from
the 10-ship international flotilla that is supposed to enforce the
embargo.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials in Washington said Tuesday that 14 ships heading
for Haiti had been diverted since Saturday, when the international
embargo was widened to include all goods save food and humanitarian
items.
</P>
<P>
According to Jacmel residents, who have little else to do but
monitor the comings and goings, only one ship has been turned back, a
vessel that made it into the harbor but fled when the Coast Guard
radioed that it would be seized if it sailed out empty.
</P>
<P>
Another ship received the same warning but unloaded its cargo
anyway. The captain, who called himself Dirty Harry, simply anchored
the ship in the bay and abandoned it. He and the crew returned to the
Dominican Republic overland, residents here said.
</P>
<P>
Sunday, a 70-foot freighter called the Sea Search also ignored that
warning -- as well as two cannon bursts from a Coast Guard cutter -- and
tied up at the pier. The Pentagon officials said another ship sailing
near Haiti's north coast was intercepted and boarded by U.S. officials
Monday and was still being searched Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Sea Search, however, was unloading barrels of fuel Monday under
the supervision of at least two Haitian army officers and in full view
of reporters and other guests at a nearby hotel.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the sieve-like blockade and a U.S. policy not to use
deadly force, diplomats and other experts say Jacmel receives upward
of 40 percent of the estimated 4 million gallons of gasoline being
smuggled into Haiti.
</P>
<P>
The most notorious ship is the Oakleigh, a 500-foot tanker that
lists its home port as Aberdeen, Scotland. Monitors say it comes from
the Dominican Republic every other day to unload at least 50,000
gallons each time.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
One day over the weekend, nine tanker trucks lined up in Jacmel to
offload fuel to be taken to the capital, Port-au-Prince, a two-hour
drive to the southwest. There it is sold on the street for about $10 a
gallon.
</P>
<P>
Most of the smuggling, diplomats and Haitian businessmen say, is
controlled by Gerard Caroli, a local businessman and close associate
of Lt. Col. Michel-Joseph Francois, the Port-au-Prince police chief
and, along with the army commander, Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, one of the
two most powerful Haitian military leaders.
</P>
<P>
While far and away the most important aspect of the smuggling, fuel
is not the only product unloaded here. One ship this past week brought
in thousands of bicycles, another a load of televisions and stereo
equipment, ``all from Miami,'' according to one person who witnessed
the unloading.

 President Works on Rights Policy Toward China (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Clinton met with more than a dozen foreign
policy, economic and political advisers late Tuesday as he worked to
shape a human rights policy toward China acceptable to opposing groups
in Congress and within the administration itself.
</P>
<P>
Having all but abandoned his threat to revoke outright China's Most
Favored Nation trade privileges unless Beijing improves its rights
record, Clinton is pondering middle-ground proposals being drawn up by
Secretary of State Warren Christopher. At issue is whether any trade
lever at all ought to be used to pry human rights concessions from
China.
</P>
<P>
After being briefed by Christopher Tuesday morning for the second
day in a row, Clinton told reporters he had ``an idea of where it's
going,'' but declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
``We still have not only ongoing negotiations with Congress but
with others as well, and there are a number of things that still have
to be resolved,'' he said at a photo session with Guntis Ulmanis, the
visiting president of Latvia.
</P>
<P>
Officials described Tuesday's Clinton-Christopher meeting as an
``informal'' report by Christopher on China as well as other subjects.
One official said that ``virtually everyone in the Cabinet and
subcabinet has an opinion'' on the issue. Congressional sources said
three options, and perhaps some combination of them, are alive. One is
a simple extension of MFN, coupled with creation of an American
committee to advise Clinton on China and establishment of a
Chinese-American binational committee to investigate human rights.
</P>
<P>
The second option is a ban on weapons and ammunitions imports from
China. Armements are produced by the People's Liberation Army, which
carried out the 1989 crackdown on student pro-democracy demonstrators
in Tiananmen square. The repression soured the mood of relations and
enraged many members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
Both options would require no more than an executive order from
Clinton and so avoid a congressional battle over China.
</P>
<P>
The third option is to increase levies on a host of goods produced
by the army in order to bite more deeply into the Chinese economy.
That proposal would require legislation.
</P>
<P>
The White House is preoccupied with callibrating its decision to
produce the least political turmoil among Democrats in particular, a
senior official said. ``There isn't much doubt we would prevail in any
vote on this issue in the Senate,'' said a senior official, ``The
point is we would like to achieve a solution that is acceptable to the
Democratic Senate leadership and leaders on this issue in particular.'
</P>
<P>
Extending MFN with no punitive or with limited punitive measures
would win the support of 60 votes in the Senate, a Democratic
leadership aide in the Senate said Tuesday. The House is another
matter, and officials have had dozens of conversations with Rep. Nancy
Pelosi, D-Calif., a leading human rights proponent for China, as well
House Democratic leaders and others aimed at heading off a
confrontation there. The White House expects Rep. Gerald B. Solomon,
R-N.Y., to introduce a resolution to rescind MFN, as he has done every
year since 1989.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he will announce his decision before he leaves for
Europe June 1. Aides said the announcement probably would come by
Friday because of Congress' strong desire Congress to discuss the
issue publicly before the Memorial Day recess, which begins Friday.
``He is going to get the stuffing knocked out of him if he does it
when we are not here,'' said one Democratic official who fears a too
lenient ruling toward China and wants to register a public protest.
</P>
<P>
Christopher, who reported to Clinton Monday that China had met
minimal conditions for continuation of its low tariff trade status,
devoted much of Tuesday to Congressional consultations, in an
indication of the political heat that surrounds the pending decision.
</P>
<P>
After conferring with Pelosi, who is pressing for sweeping
sanctions on goods produced by the army, Christopher met with Sen. Max
Baucus, D-Mont., and other Senators who urged him extend China's trade
priveleges unconditionally rather than risk lost American business and
worsening relaitons with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Senatorial aides described Christopher as guarded in discussing
which option he might choose. Baucus, Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo.,
and Reps. Robert Matsui, D-Calif., and Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., wrote a
letter to Clinton opposing the proposal to raise tariffs on limited
numbers of products produced either by the Chinese army or state owned
industries.

 U.S., Japan Agree to Resume Trade Talks (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three months after U.S.-Japanese ties sank to their
lowest point in the Clinton administration, negotiators agreed Tuesday
to resume trade talks, with U.S. officials painting a suddenly sunny
picture of one of the country's most important, but troubled,
relationships.
</P>
<P>
``No one can guarantee that these agreements are going to work,''
said President Clinton's senior trade assistant, Mickey Kantor. But,
he added: ``I can tell you we have momentum and dedication and purpose
and involvement at the highest level of the Japanese and U.S.
governments.''
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Japanese officials said the accord, hammered out in five
days of meetings, gets the two sides over a key hurdle involving how
to determine whether the terms of any trade agreement are being met if
numerical targets, to which the Japanese object, are not included.
</P>
<P>
Stripped of the diplomatic veneer in which it was cloaked, the
breakthrough is little more than an agreement to return to the
negotiating table. And it leaves the two trading giants not much
closer to a substantive agreement than they were last July when they
first established a ``framework'' for their talks.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, said Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa in
Tokyo, brings the two sides to the ``starting line, not the goal.''
</P>
<P>
It was reached by senior-level negotiators at 1:30 a.m. EDT, then
sealed in a 14-minute telephone conversation nine hours later between
Clinton and the new Japanese prime minister, Tsutomu Hata.
</P>
<P>
``Both agreed that we can move forward now quickly,'' said Kantor,
the U.S. trade representative.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations are intended to increase foreign sales in Japan in
four key economic sectors: government procurement of medical and
telecommunications equipment, insurance, automobiles and auto parts.
Kantor expressed hope that the talks could be broadened to include
financial services, glass products and intellectual property rights,
which covers an array of creative endeavors ranging from musical
composition to pharmaceutical research.
</P>
<P>
Despite the limited nature of Tuesday's agreement, Hata expressed
confidence that it will lead to an actual trade accord.
</P>
<P>
``Not only Japan but the whole world is watching,'' Hata said. ``I
am absolutely confident we will find a way. Japan is determined to
open its markets, and the U.S. is just as determined to sell here.''
</P>
<P>
In the long run, U.S. officials hope Japan will relax its barriers
to foreign products and bring down its trade surplus, which last year
reached $131 billion in goods and services. Its trade surplus with the
United States was $59 billion, and is expected to climb this year.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
The United States offered a firm commitment to avoid specific
numerical targets for foreign sales in Japan. Instead, the two sides
agreed to place their focus on ``results-oriented goals,'' which would
include both ``quantitative and qualitative criteria.''
</P>
<P>
A quantitative measurement, Kantor said, could include ``the
prompt, substantial and continuous increase in sales'' by foreign
insurance companies in Japan, for example, or in the number of U.S.
car dealerships in Japan.
</P>
<P>
A qualitative measure, he said, could be the degree of cooperation
between U.S. auto parts suppliers and Japanese carmakers in research
and development projects.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the United States retained the option to use
trade laws, including the imposition of tariffs and quotas on Japanese
products sold in this country, if sufficient progress is not made in
the resumed talks.

 Denny's to Pay $46 Million to Settle Racial Bias Claims 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The parent company of Denny's announced Tuesday that it will pay
more than $46 million to settle cases of alleged racial bias in
restaurants in California, Maryland and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
Denny's opted to settle the claims partly ``because it became clear
to us that the costs of litigating all of them would be unacceptably
high,'' said Jerome J. Richardson, chairman and chief executive of
Flagstar Companies Inc. of Spartanburg, S.C., which owns Denny's.
</P>
<P>
``We deeply regret these individuals feel they were not treated
fairly at Denny's,'' Richardson added. ``We invite any customers who
have perceived discrimination at Denny's to give us another
opportunity to serve them.''
</P>
<P>
In announcing the settlement, the 1,515-restaurant chain admitted
no wrongdoing. It had been contesting these charges:
</P>
<P>
-- That a Denny's in San Jose, Calif. discriminated against 40 black
patrons by a late-night, prepay requirement, which made them pay in
advance for meals. Each of the 40 will receive $25,000. Another $27
million will be set aside for future claims. About 3,000 California
customers say they were victims of racial bias at Denny's.
</P>
<P>
-- That a Denny's in Annapolis, Md. grossly delayed service to six
black uniformed members of the U.S. Secret Service but promptly served
whites. Denny's will pay the six $35,000 each. Another 12 plaintiffs
will be paid $15,000, with $17.3 million set aside for future claims.
Another 1,300 claims are pending nationwide, excluding California.
</P>
<P>
-- That a Virginia Denny's refused to serve the Martin Luther King
Jr. All Children's Choir, including 132 singers and chaperones. After
11 p.m., Denny's says, it needed prior arrangements for prompt service
to a group that large. It is paying $450,000 to settle this complaint,
filed with the Prince William County, Va., Human Rights Commission.
</P>
<P>
Of the $46 million settlement, Denny's says, $8.7 million is going
to lawyers.
</P>
<P>
The parent company approached the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People in 1991 for help in resolving issues of
racial bias at Denny's and other subsidiaries. Last July the two
reached a $1 billion Fair Share Agreement, which is designed to pump
jobs and dollars into the black community.
</P>
<P>
``We hope such incidents never again occur at Denny's or any other
restaurant chain,'' the NAACP said Tuesday in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
In coming months, it added, it expects to see Denny's hire and
promote more minorities, along with stepped-up trade between Denny's
and minority-owned media and suppliers.
</P>
<P>
The flagship Denny's opened in California in 1953. Of its 1,515
outlets now, 1,025 are corporate-owned. Sixty-three are joint ventures
in foreign countries, and the rest are owned by 168 franchisees.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-eight of the franchisees are minorities, but none is black.

 Mandela Outlines Soaring Vision of New South Africa (Johannesburg) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a sunny day of pomp and pageantry,
President Nelson Mandela outlined a soaring vision for the new South
Africa Tuesday in his first State of the Nation speech, a carefully
crafted address that tried to balance the needs of poor blacks with
the fears of rich whites.
</P>
<P>
The nationally televised speech before a joint session of the
multiracial National Assembly and Senate in the Parliament building in
Cape Town set a healing tone and a moderate course for the new
democracy as it struggles to shed the social and economic inequities
of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
The goal, Mandela repeatedly vowed, is a ``people-centered
society.'' Its aims are nothing less than ``freedom from want, freedom
from hunger, freedom from deprivation, freedom from ignorance, freedom
from suppression and freedom from fear.''
</P>
<P>
``Let us all get down to work,'' he said, to a standing ovation
from the 490 legislators.
</P>
<P>
He pleaded for reconciliation and an end to racism. saying that
derisive words like kaffirs for blacks, coolies for Asians and baas
for a white boss should be expunged from the national vocabulary. And
in perhaps the most moving section, he read a poem linking the growth
of an African child to the demand for freedom. The author was Ingrid
Jonker, who committed suicide in 1965 after breaking with her father,
a conservative Afrikaner legislator, over the injustice and indignity
of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
``To her and others like her, we owe a commitment to the poor, the
oppressed, the wretched and the despised,'' Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the inspiring rhetoric, Mandela's initial programs and
policies were unexpectedly modest for a country in which nearly half
the black majority is unemployed, illiterate and without proper health
care or housing.
</P>
<P>
The limited scope reflected the reality of a government based on a
still-untested power-sharing formula and an economy emerging from a
four-year recession and a decade of capital flight.
</P>
<P>
In his most specific pledge, Mandela promised to start a 100-day
crash program under his personal supervision to provide immediate
health and nutrition services to impoverished families.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, children under the age of 6 and pregnant women
will receive free medical care in every state hospital and clinic.
Supplementary feeding programs for malnourished children also will
begin in every primary school ``where such need is established,''
Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, he pledged to invest ``substantial amounts'' to
provide nine years of free compulsory education. And he said he had
given instructions ``as a matter of urgency ... to empty our prisons
of children and place them in suitable alternative care.''
</P>
<P>
Mandela has said as many as 25,000 children and juveniles are held
in detention and prisons, but government leaders and corrections
officials have strenuously denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
Although Mandela conceded that ``many details ... remain to be
discussed, agreed (to) and put in place,'' he also pledged to start a
public works program to ``rebuild our townships, restore services in
rural and urban areas'' and create millions of jobs.
</P>
<P>
He gave no overall cost but said his government would allocate $735
million in its first budget for the so-called reconstruction and
development plan. He said the money would come from savings and
redirected spending in the anticipated $36 billion budget, which will
be announced next month.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Mandela clearly hoped the speech would reassure the still-nervous
national and international business communities, which are awaiting
clear signals of intent and policy from a coalition government that
includes Joe Slovo, the chairman of the Communist Party, and many
other ANC leaders trained in the former Soviet Union and other East
Bloc countries.
</P>
<P>
Eager to create a favorable investment environment, Mandela said he
is determined ``to contain general government consumption at present
levels and to manage the budget deficit with a view to its continuous
reduction.''
</P>
<P>
But he offered something less than a no-new-taxes pledge, saying
the new coalition Cabinet was ``agreed that a permanently higher
general level of taxation is to be avoided.''
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Mandela's speech was partly overshadowed by a controversy over the
surreptitious hand-over by the former government of about 7 million
acres of state land to a trust controlled by Zulu King Goodwill
Zwelithini. The transfer was signed by then-President Frederik W. de
Klerk a day before the elections and was reported by a local newspaper
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Both de Klerk and Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi have
denied wrongdoing in the last-minute transfer of nearly one-third of
the land in the new province of KwaZulu-Natal. The deal has raised
suspicions because it was completed just as Buthelezi and the king
ended an election boycott. The boycott was ostensibly based on demands
for an autonomous Zulu homeland.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who has said he was unaware of the transaction, has
ordered a Cabinet commission to look into the arrangement. He did not
mention the issue, or his campaign promises for land reform, in his
address.
</P>
<P>
The new lawmakers -- 400 from the National Assembly and 90 from the
Senate -- also make up the Constitutional Assembly, which will draft a
permanent constitution within two years to replace the interim charter
used to guide the country through last month's election.
</P>
<P>
Cyril Ramaphosa, the ANC's secretary-general, was elected without
opposition earlier Tuesday as the Constitutional Assembly's chairman.
Ramaphosa, who was widely acclaimed as the ANC's chief negotiator for
the interim constitution, declined to join Mandela's Cabinet after he
was passed over as deputy president.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
In another announcement, the new defense minister, Joe Modise, said
he has reappointed the former government's military chief for a
five-year term. He said Gen. Georg Meiring would run the new South
African National Defense Force, which will include both regular troops
and former anti-government guerrillas.

 California Bill Would See Taggers Paddled (Sacramento) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SACRAMENTO, Calif.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bill requiring juvenile graffiti vandals to
be punished with as may as 10 whacks of a wooden paddle was introduced
Tuesday by an Orange County Assemblyman, who declared the public is
``sick and tired'' of the way such offenders are ``coddled'' by the
criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
``It is hard to take pride in your neighborhood when everything you
see is covered with graffiti,'' said Republican Assemblyman Mickey
Conroy. ``That is why paddling is so important.
</P>
<P>
``If we can stop these punks who have no respect for other people,
we can give the neighborhoods back to the law-abiding citizens of this
state.''
</P>
<P>
Conroy said recent public opinion polls show overwhelming public
support for his idea. Those polls were taken in connection with a
highly publicized case in which an American teen-ager was caned in
Singapore for spraying paint on cars.
</P>
<P>
Conroy also said he has received almost 200 letters and telephone
calls in support of his proposal from across the United States.
</P>
<P>
Graffiti abatement cost Orange County $1.2 million in Santa Ana
alone last year and the Orange County Flood Control District spent
$500,000 more, according to Conroy, who said the state spent more than
$30 million on graffiti removal last year.
</P>
<P>
Conroy's measure, AB150X, ran into immediate opposition from
Democratic Assembly Speaker Willie Brown.
</P>
<P>
Asked at a Capitol news conference about the bill, Brown said he
would not vote for the legislation. ``A harsh penalty must be
imposed,'' Brown said, ``but I don't think it has to be a whipping.''
</P>
<P>
Brown said he also doesn't believe the Assembly Public Safety
Committee, the first stop for Conroy's bill, will agree with Conroy's
views on paddling.
</P>
<P>
As proposed by Conroy, any juvenile convicted of graffiti vandalism
would be given four to 10 whacks with a wooden paddle in addition to
any other sentence that might be handed down by the judge. The name of
the juvenile also would be made public.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
The paddle would be made of three-quarter-inch thick hardwood, 18
inches long and 6 inches wide. The whacks would be administered on the
outside of clothes, not the bare buttocks.
</P>
<P>
As outlined in the bill, the paddling would be administered by the
minor's parent. If the parent declines or paddles too lightly, the
judge can order a bailiff to do the job.
</P>
<P>
``I would rather give these juvenile misfits a little sting on
their bottom early on when they are young,'' Conroy said, ``so five or
10 years from now we don't see these same kids in adult court, facing
a more serious charge of rape or murder.''
</P>
<P>
Conroy said he believes paddling would survive a court test on the
issue of cruel and unusual punishment.

 House Vote Boosts Viability of C-17 Program (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a decision crucial to the future of the C-17
military cargo jet program, the House voted 330-100 Tuesday to
authorize production of six of the McDonnell Douglas Corp. planes,
restoring production of two aircraft deleted in previous committee
action.
</P>
<P>
The House action blunted efforts to force the Pentagon to buy
existing commercial jets as an alternative to the C-17, an action that
would have seriously undercut the future of the program.
</P>
<P>
Air Force Undersecretary Rudy de Leon said in an interview the
House vote was an important endorsement of the Pentagon's plan to put
McDonnell Douglas on probation and measure over the next two years
whether the company can correct longstanding problems at its Long
Beach, Calif., plant.
</P>
<P>
``We really want to put the C-17 on a solid profile so we can judge
whether McDonnell Douglas can produce at cost and on schedule,'' de
Leon said.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add End)
</P>
<P>
The House vote marked one of the few times the California
congressional delegation formed a voting block to support a defense
program in the state, a major departure from past years when weapons
programs attracted weak support from California Democrats.
</P>
<P>
The C-17 is assembled at McDonnell Douglas' massive complex in Long
Beach, supporting 10,000 jobs at the plant and another 8,000 at
subcontractors around Southern California. Nationally, about 30,000
jobs are tied to the aircraft's production, now the Pentagon's largest
program.
</P>
<P>
The C-17 has long been controversial. McDonnell is an estimated
$1.6 billion over budget on the aircraft program and has experienced a
long series of embarrassing technical problems, including the failure
of C-17 wings to meet strength requirements.

 Republicans Push to Schedule Whitewater Hearings (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republican lawmakers stepped up pressure on Democrats
Tuesday to schedule congressional hearings into the Whitewater affair,
as Special Counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. wound down the initial phase of
his investigation of President Clinton's role in the failed Arkansas
land venture.
</P>
<P>
Ending what had been the Clinton administration's first extended
respite from GOP criticism over Whitewater, more than 90 House
Republicans led by Rep. John T. Doolittle, R-Calif., introduced a
resolution calling for concurrent hearings by five congressional
committees. The hearings would begin no later than Aug. 15, the
resolution states.
</P>
<P>
In the Senate, Republicans were threatening to force a vote on
hearings before the end of the week if behind-the-scenes negotiations
between party leaders fail to resolve a long-running partisan dispute
over the timing and forum for a congressional probe.
</P>
<P>
GOP sources said ``some progress'' was made following a meeting
Monday between Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and
Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., but the two sides continued to
disagree over ground rules. If no agreement is reached by Wednesday,
they said, Republicans might try to force a Whitewater vote before
lawmakers leave town for a weeklong Memorial Day recess.
</P>
<P>
Both the House and the Senate voted in March to recommend that
Congress hold hearings on the Whitewater affair provided Democratic
and Republican leaders could structure them in a way that did not
interfere with Fiske's criminal investigation. Since then, Republicans
have repeatedly accused the Democrats of stalling the public probe in
hopes that public interest in Whitewater would completely subside.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, several developments have given Clinton's GOP
critics what they see as an opportunity to renew their calls for
public Whitewater hearings. One involves charges of sexual harassment
filed against Clinton by former Arkansas state employee Paula Corbin
Jones. Another is the anticipated indictment of House Ways and Means
Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., on felony charges. Both
situations, while unrelated to Whitewater, have provided GOP
sharpshooters with new ammunition to use in their ethics attacks on
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
``The Paula Jones thing makes Clinton more vulnerable on
Whitewater, and visa versa, because they both address the character
question,'' said one Republican leadership aide.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Fiske, meanwhile, is nearing the end of the first phase of his
investigation into Whitewater Development Corp. and its possible
contribution to the failure of a Little Rock, Ark., thrift. Fiske has
repeatedly stated that, while he would prefer no public hearings at
this stage, he would not object to a limited congressional probe once
the first phase of his investigation was completed.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Tom Foley, D-Wash., plans to meet with Fiske Thursday
to ``sound him out'' on possible hearings once his initial probe is
finished, a Democratic aide said.
</P>
<P>
But Doolittle and other Republicans charged that the Democrats were
still playing for time, hoping that health care reform and other
concerns will once again submerge questions about Whitewater.
</P>
<P>
``Two months have elapsed since the House passed'' a resolution
recommending Whitewater hearings and ``those hearings have yet to
materialize and no timetable has been set,'' Doolittle said, adding
that, ``it's time we do something about it.''

 Business World Watches CBS, Though Not Necessarily on TV (New York) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From Madison Avenue to Wall Street Tuesday, they were
watching CBS.
</P>
<P>
Not ``Hard Copy'' or ``Geraldo,'' but CBS' business prospects for
success in the coming months as the network faces the daunting reality
that it will lose up to eight of its major affiliate stations to
Rupert Murdoch's brash young fourth network, Fox Inc., which last year
stole away CBS' long-held contract to broadcast National Football
Conference games.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, CBS stock continued its two-day decline sparked by
Monday's announcement that Fox Inc. had agreed to invest $500 million
in New World Comunications Group. As part of that bargain it will gain
up to 12 TV stations as affiliates, many in major markets, that
currently are affiliated with CBS, NBC and ABC. The biggest loser was
CBS.
</P>
<P>
CBS' stock price fell 33½, or 11 percent, since its Friday closing
of 303½, finishing out Tuesday at 270. That means Loews Corp., the
conglomerate controlled by CBS Chairman Laurence Tisch and his brother
Preston R. Tisch, lost about $100 million on paper over two days.
</P>
<P>
Although advertising executives said the news was clearly a major
blow for CBS, they said the full impact of Fox's deal could not be
calculated. The timing is tricky, since it is the beginning of the
season known as the ``upfront.'' That's when advertisers lock up rates
for prime-time shows and make ad time commitments for the September to
August season.
</P>
<P>
The Fox deal could hurt CBS, which expects to control $1 billion of
an estimated $4 billion upfront ad market, by making buyers less
willing to pay top rates.
</P>
<P>
``An astute buyer will use this as leverage,'' said Steven
Auerbach, a media buying consultant. Added Bruce Goerlich, senior vice
president and media director USA for ad agency DMB B: ``This is a good
shot over the bow, and it will cause CBS to list a bit.''
</P>
<P>
Losing affiliate VHF stations -- those with channel positions of up
to 13 on the dial -- is a serious blow for CBS, observers said. CBS
already faces a strong challenge to its fall lineup from rival ABC,
which reaches the younger audience desired by advertisers.
</P>
<P>
CBS could wind up with weak lead-ins to its strong shows, such as
the ``Late Show with David Letterman,'' as it is forced to replace the
affiliates with less popular stations, some of them UHF stations that
appear above 13 on the dial. The Fox deal is likely to spark a
scramble as networks compete for the stronger affiliates.
</P>
<P>
The loss of the eight stations will not happen all at once because
of different contract periods. It also might not affect where
advertisers put their money this year. Those decisions are driven
largely by the demographic profiles of the network audiences, said
Betsy Frank, senior vice president and director of TV information and
new media at Saatchi Saatchi. But, she added, concerns over CBS'
lineup of affiliates in major markets could cause media buyers to push
for discounts.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
CBS' Tony Malara, president of affiliate relations, got the bad
news early Monday morning that CBS would be losing its five affiliate
stations owned by New World in Atlanta, Tampa, Cleveland, Detroit and
Milwaukee, and stood to lose three more once New World completes its
planned acquisition of two other companies that own CBS affiliates.
</P>
<P>
Soon Malara was on the phone talking to station owners. Malara said
Tuesday that he actually sees some potential opportunities, such as
finding new affiliates that will carry Letterman.
</P>
<P>
Currently, four of New World's stations air Letterman a half hour
late, and Milwaukee doesn't carry him at all.

 Clinton Expected to Renew China's Trade Status (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Presidential candidate Bill Clinton vowed he would
punish Chinese leaders by revoking China's preferential trading status
if they failed to demonstrate documented progress in human rights.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton is just about to do the opposite.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is expected to announce soon that he is renewing China's
most-favored-nation trading status despite China's inability to meet
several human rights objectives outlined by Clinton in an executive
order a year ago. In doing so, Clinton would begin the process of
de-linking human rights issues from trade policy -- a link that has
been a hallmark of Democratic party foreign policy for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is not alone. In Congress -- where the sentiment for such a
linkage was first nurtured and frequently promoted -- many members who
previously supported revoking China's trading rights have changed
their minds. Indeed, Secretary of State Warren Christopher Tuesday
went to Capitol Hill to gauge how much the sentiment has changed in
the past year, his spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Christopher said he hasn't made a recommendation to the president.
Clinton told reporters he would make an announcement before departing
for Europe June 1 -- by law his deadline is June 3.
</P>
<P>
``The administration is definitely moving toward de-linking human
rights and trade, and there is widespread support in Congress for
that,'' said Bonnie Glaser, a Washington-based consultant on Chinese
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
Subcommittee on Asia and Pacific Affairs and a longtime advocate of
tying economic relations to a nation's human rights record, said
Clinton ``should abandon the charade of linking MFN to human rights.
... This has become a silly dance. We demand they take action, they
let three or four people out of jail and we call it a victory. We
should be using other levers, so let's drop the fig leaf of MFN.''
</P>
<P>
Clinton may not explicitly say that he is de-linking human rights
and trade, and indeed may levy some minor sanctions on China to
indicate his displeasure with its human rights policies. Aides
indicate the president will portray his actions as a middle course,
but experts say he essentially will be abandoning his previous tough
line on China. ``That's just trying to prevent Bill Clinton from
having egg all over his face,'' Glaser said.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the change is that the prospect of 1.2 billion
Chinese one day buying American goods has proven far more persuasive
than the forced labor camps, silenced dissidents and jammed Voice of
America broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
All but nine nations have MFN status with the United States, and
those nine are minor economic powers like Cuba and Vietnam. Trade with
China is now $40 billion and growing rapidly every year, and the
economic implications of revoking MFN with China became virtually
impossible to contemplate for the administration.
</P>
<P>
``It is so clear to the rest of the world that we've moved far more
on this than China has,'' said Alan Tonelson, research director at the
Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington-based think tank
specializing in trade issues.
</P>
<P>
The linkage between human rights and trade started 20 years ago in
Congress, when the late Sen. Henry Jackson, D-Wash., and then-Rep.
Charles Vanik, D-Ohio, pushed through legislation tying the
then-miniscule trade with the Soviet Union and other communist nations
to their record in allowing the emigration of Jews.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Although presidents, as a matter of principle, resisted
congressional attempts to link human rights to their ability to
conduct foreign policy, former President Carter made human rights a
centerpiece of his foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Christopher, then the No. 2 man in Carter's State Department, was
the administration's coordinator for human rights and
institutionalized the linkage between human rights and foreign policy,
using trade and economic aid as weapons.
</P>
<P>
Now, in a different administration, Christopher is seeking to bend,
if not break, the ties between human rights and the use of MFN status.

 Jones' Suit Should Be Postponed Till Clinton Leaves Office, 
 Cutler Says (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
White House special counsel Lloyd N. Cutler said
Tuesday that Paula Corbin Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit against
President Clinton should be postponed because it would harm the
president to have to deal with it while he is in office.
</P>
<P>
Cutler, appearing on the McNeil-Lehrer NewsHour, was the first
administration official to state publicly that the lawsuit should not
be allowed to go forward at this time. He laid out a comprehensive
administration argument for granting Clinton immunity from having to
deal with the Jones lawsuit while he is in office.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that Clinton would pursue that claim up to the
Supreme Court, a strategy that could help the administration delay the
taking of depositions or other discovery in the case. Cutler said
resolving that question could take ``well over a year, perhaps
longer.''
</P>
<P>
Clinton's private lawyer, Robert S. Bennett, said Tuesday that he
will claim that Clinton cannot be sued while in office. He has until
July 15 to file papers in the case.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department is also planning to file a brief expressing
its official view in the case, in which a former Arkansas state
employee claims Clinton sexually harassed her when he was governor.
Because the department is charged with protecting the prerogatives of
the executive branch, it would be surprising if it did not support
some claim of presidential immunity.
</P>
<P>
The issue is an unresolved legal question. The Supreme Court has
said that presidents may not be sued for their acts as president, but
has never addressed the question of private conduct.
</P>
<P>
Cutler did not argue that there is a blanket rule protecting a
president while in office from being sued for his private acts. He
said that in cases where ``immediate relief'' is required -- such as a
divorce, a failure to pay child support, or a zoning dispute -- a case
might be allowed to proceed.
</P>
<P>
Cutler said ``the issue has to be judged in each case,'' weighing
the needs of the person suing against the duties of the president.
</P>
<P>
But he argued that in the case of the Jones lawsuit, the fact that
the alleged conduct took place 20 months before Clinton took office
and that she waited an additional 16 months before bringing suit
should be factored into that decision.
</P>
<P>
``What would be lost in balancing her interest against the interest
of the presidency if it were deferred for an additional period,''
Cutler said. ``No immediate relief is required here. This case was
brought on the 364th day of the third year'' -- the last day before it
would have been barred under the Arkansas statute of limitations.
</P>
<P>
Cutler set out what the administration may well argue should be the
court test in deciding whether such cases should be postponed: ``If
the burden of the case is significant and if the progress of the case
would damage the president and the presidency ... then there is a
basis'' for granting a stay.
</P>
<P>
Although the argument for presidential immunity could well stall
progress in the lawsuit for years, one wrinkle -- which Cutler did not
address -- is whether a separate part of the case would be allowed to
go forward in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Clinton, Jones has also named Arkansas State Trooper
Danny Ferguson in the case, claiming that he was part of a conspiracy
with Clinton to deprive her of her civil rights and that his later
comments defamed her
</P>
<P>
Several experts in court procedures have said it is likely that a
court would let the Ferguson part of the case proceed even if a stay
is granted to the president -- an outcome that could permit Jones'
lawyers to question Ferguson and other troopers about Clinton's
alleged conduct in this case and claims that Clinton regularly used
troopers to solicit women.

 Plea Bargain Talks for Rostenkowski Focusing on Prison Time (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Efforts to reach a plea bargain in the fraud case
against Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., intensified Tuesday, with
agreement no longer hinging on keeping the powerful chairman of the
House Ways and Means Committee out of jail, sources familiar with the
negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
It was tentatively decided that Rostenkowski, who has been expected
to play a central role in President Clinton's health reform efforts,
would resign from Congress.
</P>
<P>
Under discussion is how much time U.S. Attorney Eric Holder would
recommend that Rostenkowski serve in prison and whether U.S. District
Judge Norma H. Johnson would be bound by that recommendation, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations, which grew out of a traditional meeting with
prosecutors at which defense attorneys are given an opportunity to
argue why their client should not be charged, have been under way
since it became clear that Holder intended to ask a federal grand jury
to indict Rostenkowski for misusing his office for financial gain.
</P>
<P>
Sources in and out of government estimated the chances that a plea
bargain would be reached at 50-50.
</P>
<P>
The federal grand jury to which Holder would present any proposed
charges is scheduled to meet Thursday but the plea discussions, if
they continue, could push the matter over to next week, one source
said. Another source, describing Rostenkowski as ``headstrong,'' said
that the discussions could collapse, clearing the way for action
Thursday or next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The advantage to the government in a plea bargain would be avoiding
a long and expensive legal process with no certainty of conviction,
while achieving the ``symbolically important'' goal of putting in
jail, even for less than a year, a lawmaker who admitted corruption.
</P>
<P>
For Rostenkowski, the agreement would offer a chance to avoid the
humiliation of a public trial and the prospect of a possible
conviction and long sentence, which could result even if he were
convicted on only one of multiple felony counts.
</P>
<P>
Dismissing reports that the plea negotiations are still focusing on
whether Rostenkowski would step down as chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee and would have to serve time, one source said that his
lawyer, Robert S. Bennett, is engaged in ``damage control,'' trying to
ensure that his client's time behind bars would be limited.
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski's resignation from the House appears to be a ``very
live option,'' according to one well-placed Democrat. His departure
would avoid the possibility of a censure resolution and foil attempts
by Republicans to force the House Ethics Committee to investigate
Rostenkowski and others allegedly involved in misuse of the now
defunct House post office. The Ways and Means chairman is alleged to
have converted $22,000 in postage stamps from his office accounts to
cash for his personal use through the post office. Rostenkowski also
is alleged to have paid employees for work they did not do. He has
denied wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
If Rostenkowski is indicted on felony charges, rules of the House
Democratic Caucus would require him to step down as chairman of the
Ways and Means Committee although he could continue as a member of the
panel.
</P>
<P>
But associates said that Rostenkowski would resign from Congress if
he had to give up his chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
Justice Department guidelines for federal prosecutors state that
resignation from office is among ``appropriate and desirable
objectives in plea negotiations with public officials who are charged
with federal offenses that focus on abuse of the office involve.''
</P>
<P>
While resignation ``shall not be imposed involuntarily against the
will'' of a member of Congress, an offer of resignation ``may be
incorporated into plea agreements,'' the guidelines state.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
The high political stakes and spillover from the Rostenkowski case
were made clear Tuesday by House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.,
who noted that defense lawyer Bennett also is representing Clinton in
a sexual harassment complaint brought by a former Arkansas state
employee.
</P>
<P>
``Clearly when you have the president's lawyer negotiating with the
Justice Department over a national health care leader,'' Gingrich
said, ``the American people have some cause to wonder what's going
on.'' He said the great concern among Republicans is that White House
political interference with Rostenkowski's case would prevent justice
from being done.
</P>
<P>
``What we're concerned about is some sort of strange plea
bargaining taking place in which political pressure could be brought
to bear,'' Gingrich added. ''You can't have one of the most powerful
members of the House having the same lawyer as the president at this
critical moment being involved in a plea bargain and not say anything
about it.'' '
</P>
<P>
``He (Rostenkowski) doesn't want to go to prison,'' said a
Democratic colleague, indicating why it may be difficult for
Rostenkowski's lawyers to reach a plea bargain agreement with federal
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, a plea bargain that does not include prison time
or a resignation would trigger demands from Republicans, and some
Democrats, for a tough censure resolution and demands for an Ethics
Committee investigation that probably would be approved by the House.

 Discrimination Suit Against Denny's Settled for $54.4 million(Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. government officials and civil rights advocates,
hailing a ``new partnership'' dedicated to weeding out racism in
commercial establishments, announced Tuesday a record $54.4 million
discrimination settlement with the embattled Denny's restaurant chain.
</P>
<P>
The settlement, which earmarks funds for Denny's patrons who feel
they were victims of discrimination, closes the book on class-action
lawsuits that evoked a modern version of the lunch-counter protests of
the civil rights movement's early days.
</P>
<P>
``With the help and cooperation of private counsel, the Justice
Department and Denny's have entered into the largest, most sweeping
nationwide settlement of a public accommodations case in history,''
said Deval L. Patrick, assistant attorney general for civil rights.
</P>
<P>
The deal, which must be approved in U.S. district courts in San
Jose and Baltimore, ends a painful chapter for Flagstar Cos. of
Spartanburg, S.C., which owns the chain. The company was accused in
the lawsuits of fostering a discriminatory corporate culture and
refusing to serve blacks at some of its 1,400 Denny's restaurants
across the country.
</P>
<P>
Some black customers, for example, said they were asked to prepay
for meals or pay cover charges before they were seated. One former
restaurant manager said he was told by superiors to close his
restaurant if ``too many'' black customers approached.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the arrangement, Flagstar did not admit to any
wrongdoing. Nevertheless, Justice Department officials said it
represents a landmark in civil rights enforcement -- the largest
settlement ever negotiated in a case involving discrimination at
restaurants, hotels or other public accommodations.
</P>
<P>
The agreement resolves separate lawsuits filed last year in
California and Maryland. The California plaintiffs included Rachel
Thompson of Vallejo, a 15-year-old black who went to Denny's to
celebrate her 13th birthday, but was refused the restaurant's
customary free birthday meal.
</P>
<P>
The Maryland lawsuit was filed by six U.S. Secret Service officers
who stopped at a Denny's in Annapolis amid preparations for a speech
by President Clinton at the U.S. Naval Academy. The black agents said
they sat for nearly a hour without receiving service, even as they
watched white colleagues eat second and third helpings. Their lawsuit
was expanded to include claimants in 48 other states.
</P>
<P>
Under the settlement, Flagstar will pay $28 million in damages to
Californian customers, plus $6.8 million in attorneys fees. The chain
will pay $17.7 million to customers in Maryland and other states,
along with $1.9 million in legal fees.
</P>
<P>
Customers who feel they were treated unfairly at Denny's can
request claim forms and apply for a portion of the damages by calling
the company toll-free at (800) 836-0055.
</P>
<P>
The claims will be screened by an independent claims administrator
and the Washington Lawyer's Committee for Civil Rights and Urban
Affairs, which filed the Maryland lawsuit. Damages will be prorated
among victims whose claims are approved.
</P>
<P>
Besides paying damages, Flagstar will be required to retain an
independent civil rights monitor to ensure the company's compliance
with the settlement. In addition, it agreed to feature blacks as
customers and employees in advertisements, train its employees in
racial sensitivity, and allow representatives of a civil rights group
to make random spot checks of Denny's outlets to detect bias.
</P>
<P>
Flagstar officials said the company already has begun satisfying
many of the agreement's requirements.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for plaintiffs in the class-action suits said the
settlement could become a precedent for future discrimination cases.
</P>
<P>
Patrick, noting that the Justice Department is pursuing 20 other
cases involving alleged discrimination at public accommodations,
issued a pointed warning to any companies that still practice racial
discrimination: ``We are watching.''
</P>
<P>
The settlement ``symbolizes what I think is a return of the finest
moments of the civil rights struggles, in which the Department of
Justice locked arms with civil rights lawyers and the private bar to
win relief for victims of discrimination,'' said John P. Relman, an
attorney with the Washington Lawyer's Committee. ``We hope and believe
that this is the beginning of a new partnership. ... We want the
Justice Department by our side.''
</P>
<P>
Flagstar still faces a handful of individual discrimination
lawsuits. A spokesman said the company hopes to settle those cases
separately.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Flagstar entered a ``fair share'' agreement with the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and agreed
to expand minority ownership of its franchises. Although the company
has no black-owned franchises, a spokesman said 28 potential owners
are under consideration.

 Palestinians Get Lesson in the Limits of Power (Jericho) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
JERICHO, West Bank
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Palestinian police, who apparently thought
they were in control of this small-town experiment in self-rule, got a
rude lesson Tuesday in the limits of power.
</P>
<P>
Israel sealed off Jericho for 24 hours after a policeman disarmed
and detained three Jewish settlers who had come to town to change
money. The closure, the Israeli army said, is to give Palestinian
commanders time to explain to their officers that Israelis are
untouchables.
</P>
<P>
It was a day of back-to-back crises in the fledgling arrangement
that provides limited self-rule for Jericho and the Gaza Strip while
leaving substantial authority in Israel's hands.
</P>
<P>
A potentially bloody incident between the armed settlers and
Palestinian police was narrowly averted in Jericho. At the same time,
a ferocious political battle is shaping up over other efforts by
Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat to assert his
legislative rule in the autonomous zones and to post Palestinian
police officers at a PLO office in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Since the self-rule agreement was signed in Cairo, Egypt, May 4,
Israel and the PLO have disagreed sharply over its interpretation and
the PLO's ability to take charge on the ground.
</P>
<P>
In Jericho, site of the most serious power clash since Israel's
troop withdrawal 10 days ago, two men from the nearby Israeli farming
settlement of Naama were detained by a Palestinian policeman who
briefly confiscated their pistols. A third settler reported the
incident to Israeli army commanders, who complained to a Palestinian
commander and won the settlers' release.
</P>
<P>
The incident could have turned violent, according to the settlers.
At one point, one of the Israelis lied when asked if he was armed. The
Arab police officer then patted the settler down and found a pistol
jammed into his waistband.
</P>
<P>
The settler started to pull out the gun. The police officer raised
his rifle and cocked it. Shlomi Yohanan, another armed settler at the
scene in downtown Jericho, said he came within a twitch of drawing his
own gun.
</P>
<P>
``I was half a second from shooting the Arab,'' a shaken Yohanan
said later. ``I was only thinking of my friend. But can you imagine
what would have happened to the peace if I had shot him? My God.''
</P>
<P>
The autonomy agreement gives Palestinian security forces the right
only to ask an Israeli in their jurisdiction for identification and
for a gun license. The Israeli doesn't have to respond. A Palestinian
policeman can only hand over an Israeli to Israeli soldiers, but not
detain him.
</P>
<P>
The army said it closed Jericho to enable Palestinian commanders
``to explain to all police ... their powers and authority.''
</P>
<P>
Palestinians say they don't want any armed Israelis inside the
self-rule areas. Israel said the agreement permits licensed Jewish gun
owners to take their weapons wherever they choose, even into places of
worship in PLO-controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
The issue of guns and jurisdiction isn't likely to go away.
</P>
<P>
In another incident causing friction, a PLO-appointed commander in
the West Bank said he wants to station Palestinian police to guard an
office in East Jerusalem. Israel's police minister, Moshe Shahal, said
that would be illegal and threatened to stop the PLO by any means from
establishing a security outpost in the Israeli capital.
</P>
<P>
Arafat Tuesday opened another front in the battle for power by
announcing that he is canceling, effective immediately, all
Israeli-written laws, military orders and regulations issued over the
27 years of occupation in Gaza and Jericho.
</P>
<P>
Israeli authorities said Arafat cannot do that because the
self-rule agreement gives Palestinians only those legislative powers
approved by Israel.
</P>
<P>
``These claims by any Palestinian authorities have no grounds
because any legislation needs the approval of Israel,'' said a Foreign
Ministry spokesman.

 Ships Openly Defy Sieve-Like Haiti Blockade (Port-au-Prince) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five of them sit at the pier, ships of all
measure, varying from 70 feet to seven times that size. Some fly the
Haitian flag, one the British ensign, and some fly no flags at all.
They all have one thing in common: They defy the world.
</P>
<P>
From the Leo, an anchorless rust bucket recently pulled from the
beach where it had run aground, to the British-flagged Oakleigh, all
have run a U.N. embargo to bring in tens of thousands of gallons of
banned fuel oil -- even, in at least one case, in the face of warning
shots from U.S. enforcers. Pentagon officials said Tuesday in
Washington that 14 ships heading for Haiti had been diverted since the
embargo went into effect over the weekend. But other ships keep
coming.
</P>
<P>
Jacmel, a resort created as a pseudo French seaside village by
early 19th-century coffee magnates, has become the center of the
Haitian military's effort to break the international sanctions
intended to force the army from power.
</P>
<P>
``The border is still a serious problem,'' a diplomat said of the
frontier between Haiti and the Dominican Republic, ``and lots of gas
comes through, but the biggest threat is now the sea.''
</P>
<P>
Under threat is the strategy by the United Nations and the United
States to use a near-total embargo to end military rule and restore
exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was driven from office
Sept. 20, 1991, after seven months as Haiti's only democratically
elected president.
</P>
<P>
``If we can't stop smuggling, especially from the D.R., then the
embargo is not only a failure, it is stupid,'' the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
``Ships come all the time,'' said a foreign resident who has lived
here for more than 20 years. ``They unload barrels of gas, or they
just pump it out into truck tankers, all in plain sight of the
choppers.''
</P>
<P>
The choppers are U.S. naval and Coast Guard helicopters flying from
the 10-ship international flotilla that is supposed to enforce the
embargo, which was widened at midnight Saturday to include all goods
save food and humanitarian items.

 Relatives of Accused Colosio Assasin Implicate Agents (Los Angeles) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LOS ANGELES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Newly reunited family members of the accused assassin
of Mexican presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio have given a
potentially explosive new account of the case that implicates two
Mexican federal security officials, family representatives said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The accused assassin's father now says that his son knew the two
security agents and met with them two months before the March 23
assassination, said Jorge Mancillas, a University of California, Los
Angeles, professor and adviser to the family.
</P>
<P>
Mancillas talked Tuesday with the family of Mario Aburto Martinez
at the office of their lawyer two days after Aburto's mother and five
other relatives crossed the border illegally from Tijuana and
requested political asylum, alleging that they had been harassed and
threatened.
</P>
<P>
Aburto, a 23-year-old factory worker charged with gunning down
Colosio at a Tijuana campaign rally, said he was friends with a man
identified as a security guard for Colosio, Mancillas said. Mario
Aburto told his father, Ruben, in January that the guard was going to
introduce him to an ``important person,'' an agent in Mexico's
Interior Ministry, at a meeting in a Tijuana gymnasium, Mancillas
said.
</P>
<P>
The two security agents have been the focus of intense
investigation and speculation because of their mysterious actions at
the assassination scene; the Interior Ministry agent was even arrested
as he ran from the scene with a bloodstained shirt. But neither has
been charged.
</P>
<P>
The revelations by Aburto's family appear significant because there
have been few developments and many conspiracy theories since the
arrests of Aburto and three alleged accomplices, volunteer security
guards at the rally. But the new account comes after weeks in which
the family's statements to the news media have changed several times,
causing Mexican officials and others to privately question their
credibility.
</P>
<P>
The family's representatives, however, said Ruben Aburto and other
relatives in Los Angeles had been reluctant to speak until now because
they feared retaliation against the family members in Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
``He's been very scared,'' Mancillas said of the father. ``He
believed they could kill his family in Tijuana. He's very afraid of
retaliation.''
</P>
<P>
Ruben Aburto and the accused assassin's brothers are willing to
meet with Mexican investigators to disclose what they know about the
assassination and about Aburto's actions in the preceding months, said
the family's lawyer, Peter Schey of the Center for Human Rights and
Constitutional Law in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
Schey said Mexican investigators made contact with the Aburtos in
Los Angeles about 10 days ago, using an FBI agent as a go-between.
</P>
<P>
``The family wants the truth of the assassination to come out,''
Schey said. ``The family is willing to accept the truth.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Before talking to investigators, however, the Aburtos want the
Mexican government to let Ruben Aburto visit his imprisoned son in
Mexico City and also permit visits by attorneys from the United States
and a doctor selected by the family, Schey said.
</P>
<P>
Aburto's mother and other family members in Tijuana already have
been questioned by Mexican police. The six relatives have been
released while they seek political asylum or temporary residence based
on humanitarian grounds. In the past month, the family has been
followed, frightened by a series of attempted break-ins and had the
windows of their house shattered by gunfire, Schey said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. immigration officials say that the case will receive no
special treatment. They said diplomatic sensitivities -- a political
asylum case would force U.S. authorities to pass judgment on Mexico's
handling of the Colosio case -- are not an issue.
</P>
<P>
The statements connecting Aburto to other figures in the case
provide the strongest potential evidence of a conspiracy in a
secretive, much-criticized investigation. The special prosecutor has
yet to explain the motives and masterminds behind the alleged plot,
basing the case largely on videotapes of the assassination and on the
confession of Aburto, who insists that the alleged accomplices were
not involved.
</P>
<P>
In various statements to reporters, however, Aburto's father has
said his son went to a shadowy political meeting in March with two of
the accused accomplices, former Baja police officers who worked in the
volunteer security team provided by Colosio's political party. The two
are charged with obstructing Colosio's military bodyguards, enabling
the gunman to advance through a crowd and shoot the candidate at
point-blank range.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's revelations are particularly sensitive because they
incriminate two other agents initially named as suspects whose roles
have never been fully explained.

 Clinton to Prod Lawmakers to Finish Health Care Bills (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With all five congressional committees working on
health care legislation now certain to miss their self-imposed
Memorial Day deadline for producing bills, President Clinton will go
to Capitol Hill Wednesday evening to prod them to finish their work.
</P>
<P>
Until Tuesday, it appeared that at least one of the panels -- the
Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee -- stood a chance of passing
a bill to overhaul the United States' health care system before
Congress adjourns for the weeklong recess. However, Chairman Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., announced late in the day that it would be
``unwise'' to rush to meet that deadline.
</P>
<P>
He blamed at least part of the delay on ``unforeseen events'' -- an
apparent reference to the death and funeral of Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis.
</P>
<P>
``But there is also a larger sense that in this situation, haste
right now would make waste,'' Kennedy said. ``The more time we spend,
the more progress we are making. It would be foolish to jeopardize
further cooperation by forcing too many decisions prematurely.''
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Kennedy has been more successful than expected in winning
GOP votes for various aspects of his bill. All but two Republicans
joined Democrats Tuesday in beating back efforts to weaken his
proposals for expansion of coverage for long-term care.
</P>
<P>
Yet despite Kennedy's optimistic stance, the fact remains that, in
varying degrees, all five committees -- two in the Senate, and three in
the House -- have bogged down over the most fundamental choices.
</P>
<P>
The toughest issue involves finding a way to reach the president's
most basic goal of assuring that every American and legal resident of
this country has health coverage. Clinton's proposal to require all
employers to provide coverage has proven to be the most controversial
element of his bill, with opponents contending that the additional
cost would cause the smallest and weakest firms to fire workers or
shut down altogether.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and his allies thought they had made a breakthrough last
week, when Sen. John B. Breaux, D-La., previously one of the most
influential opponents of the so-called ``employer mandate,'' had said
he would support a modified version that exempted the smallest
companies. However, Breaux said Tuesday he is not finding much support
for that approach, particularly from Republicans.
</P>
<P>
Now, Breaux said, he is testing sentiment for a proposal under
which employer mandates would be put into force only if companies did
not expand coverage on their own under a reformed health care system.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in what appears to be the most dramatic effort to date
to bridge party lines on the issue, Senate Finance Committee Chairman
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., and Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., the
committee's ranking Republican, will work together in drafting the
initial version of a health care bill to be presented to their
committee after the Memorial Day break, Packwood said.
</P>
<P>
Bipartisanship is more of a necessity on the Finance Committee than
anywhere else in Congress. Democrats command an 11-9 majority there
and it is an even more fragile party front, given the fact that the
Democrats on the committee include several conservatives such as
Breaux.
</P>
<P>
There seems to be a growing sense in Congress that some sort of
breakthrough must happen -- and happen soon -- to preserve any chance of
sweeping legislation this year. Otherwise, lawmakers might pass only a
set of marginal changes in the current system.
</P>
<P>
That is why some were viewing Clinton's visit with particular
interest, despite efforts by both the White House and Democratic
leaders to downplay its significance.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Some suggested he might use the trip to Capitol Hill as an
opportunity to put forward new proposals that might elicit support
from Republicans and more conservative Democrats.
</P>
<P>
Others, however, said that would be precisely the wrong tactic.
Instead, they said, Clinton should stand firm behind his bill, and
allay fears -- particularly in the House -- that he ultimately will be
forced into giving up on the most difficult parts of his plan.
</P>
<P>
``Members are concerned about what the president's bottom line is.
They need to hear it from the president directly,'' said Rep. Henry A.
Waxman, D-Calif. ``He needs to spell out his minimum requirements for
health reform. ... If we do meet them, we need to be sure the rug
isn't going to be pulled out from us later.''

 WETA President to Resign for Health Reasons (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a surprise announcement, WETA President Sharon
Percy Rockefeller Tuesday said she is resigning immediately for health
reasons.
</P>
<P>
Rockefeller, who also has served as chief executive officer of the
public broadcasting station here since 1989, stressed in a letter to
board chairman Daniel K. Mayers that ``the sole reason for my
resignation is that, most unfortunately, I have not been able to
regain my health and energy since my 1993 accident.''
</P>
<P>
However, she intends to return to the station in the fall, albeit
in a changed role, and to remain on the board, she wrote.
</P>
<P>
On May 13, 1993, Rockefeller suffered three broken ribs and a
punctured lung when the car in which she was riding was forced off
Rock Creek Parkway during a severe thunderstorm. She returned to the
station after two months but, according to associates, has often
refused to reduce her workload, although the need for her to do so was
painfully evident.
</P>
<P>
The decision to step down ``is the most difficult decision of my
life; I do it with a lot of sadness and regret,'' she told a reporter
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
``I was never able to come back from (the accident) even though I
kept trying and trying. Eventually, it took a big toll -- the doctors
say I have to rest.'' She is already looking forward to her fall
return ``in a new position. I hope to help WETA with programming,
community outreach and fund-raising, as well as with the national
public broadcasting institutions.''
</P>
<P>
The WETA board holds its regularly scheduled meeting today and is
expected to appoint a search committee to seek Rockefeller's
replacement. Neil Mahrer, executive vice president and chief operating
officer, will continue to manage the daily operations.
</P>
<P>
In her letter to Mayers, Rockefeller said the station ``deserves
and must have a president who possesses the physical stamina to meet
the challenges which lie ahead.''
</P>
<P>
In his reply, the chairman said, ``Most of all, Sharon, we want you
to take care of yourself. Your recovery ... has been impaired by the
prodigious effort you have expended on WETA's behalf. Only those who
have worked with you can appreciate the energy and hours you have
devoted to WETA on a sustained basis over many years.''
</P>
<P>
Rockefeller, 49, is married to Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV, D-W.Va.
They have four children. She has held several major public
broadcasting appointments, including board memberships at both the
Public Broadcasting Service and the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting (which she served as chairman). She was on the board of
the West Virginia Educational Broadcasting Authority for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Richard W. Carlson, president of the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting, said, ``Sharon Rockefeller represents the heart and soul
of public broadcasting. She's always been there for us. And I know
that she won't be able to stay away for long.''
</P>
<P>
-0- 
</P>
<P>
It's been quite a couple of weeks for ABC News president Roone
Arledge. He recently turned down an offer from Rupert Murdoch to take
a major corporate job at Fox Broadcasting (reportedly the chairman's
job now held by Lucie Salhany) and on Saturday he married his
girlfriend of the past couple of years, Gigi Shaw, in a small family
ceremony at his Southampton estate. It was the third marriage for the
62-year-old Arledge. His four children and her daughter were in
attendance.
</P>
<P>
Fox Broadcasting leans heavily on new dramas in the 1994-95
primetime schedule announced Tuesday, introducing five of the
long-form shows and two situation comedies.
</P>
<P>
Missing from next fall's lineup will be ``In Living Color,''
``Brisco County Jr.,'' ``South Central,'' ``Herman's Head'' and
``Sinbad.''

 New Attorney General Shakes Up Federal Police (Mexico City) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just 10 days after taking office, Mexico's new
attorney general Tuesday announced a radical reorganization of the
Federal Judicial Police, starting with the firing of five top
commanders and the elimination of special details within the force.
</P>
<P>
The actions were taken, according to a statement from Attorney
General Humberto Benitez's office, ``to make the force more efficient
and to avoid illegal activities.''
</P>
<P>
Mexican police at all levels have come under increasing pressure in
the past year to restore public order in the wake of the unsolved
assassinations of a Roman Catholic cardinal, the leading presidential
candidate and the Tijuana police chief, in addition to a wave of
kidnappings and audacious gun battles between rival narcotics gangs.
</P>
<P>
Benitez cracked down especially hard on the department in charge of
investigations, eliminating it and firing its five commanders.

 World Trade Center Bombers Receive 240-Year Sentences (NY) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An outraged federal judge Tuesday sentenced each of four
men convicted in the World Trade Center bombing to 240 years in prison
 -- a life term calculated by adding the life expectancy of each of the
six people killed in the blast, plus 30 years for two other counts.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Kevin Duffy, who angrily addressed the
defendants after overseeing the 5½-month trial, called the four
``cowards'' for planting a bomb during the lunch hour of Feb. 26,
1993, in an effort to ``terrorize the people of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
In sentencing the four Muslim defendants, Duffy's toughest words
were to the most-educated of the group, Nidal Ayyad, a 26-year-old
chemist who helped get chemicals and arrange for vehicles. Ayyad, who
dismissed the court as not being as important as the teachings of the
Koran, said to the judge: ``You only rule over this life. You are not
going to change what God has dictated.''
</P>
<P>
``You are the biggest hypocrite in the room,'' Duffy responded
after Ayyad sat down. ``Clearly you are the most culpable. ... God
gave you brains ... and what you have done is turn your life into a
total lie.
</P>
<P>
``You talk about the Koran,'' Duffy continued, as Ayyad, dressed in
a brown one-piece prison uniform, stared straight ahead. ``You have
shamed it. ... You violated the laws not only of man but of God.''
</P>
<P>
Although some of the conspirators shouted angrily at the jury after
their conviction on March 4, Tuesday was the first time they had
spoken at length in the courtroom. All four have said they are
innocent, and their attorneys have said they plan to appeal. In
Tuesday's speeches, halted every few seconds for translation from
Arabic into English, only one of the men talked about the horror of
the crime -- Ahmad Ajaj, a 28-year-old Palestinian who was in prison on
a false passport conviction when the bomb exploded.
</P>
<P>
Ajaj stood for almost three hours, telling stories about torture
and killing in the Middle East and blaming the United States for
``terrorism'' that included the country's treatment of American
Indians and blacks and the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
</P>
<P>
Ajaj, the jury decided, was the one who masterminded the technical
parts of making the trade center bomb even while he was in prison.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Salameh, 26, the Palestinian immigrant who rented a yellow
Ryder van and was captured when he tried to get his deposit refunded,
said he would ``not beg for mercy'' from the court. After Salameh
shouted remarks to the court, Duffy said that if Salameh and his
``cohorts'' had placed the bomb in a different place, it could have
knocked one of the towers down onto another. Or, he said, cyanide gas
could have been sucked into the air ducts, killing thousands.
</P>
<P>
Mahmud Abouhalima, 34, of Woodbridge, N.J., told of being tortured
by Egyptian police who captured him when he fled to Egypt after the
bombing and turned him over the U.S. authorities. He blamed the media
for ``a very effective negative role'' in focusing public opinion,
including the jurors'. He criticized jurors for sleeping through
testimony, and he complained that prison guards had not given him
prayer beads and rugs.
</P>
<P>
``You're a convicted felon,'' Duffy said, as he began Abouhalima's
sentencing. ``You're not some guy on vacation.''
</P>
<P>
Before the four were sentenced, Ed Smith, whose pregnant wife was
killed in the blast, read an appeal to the judge that the four would
be ``held in custody for the duration of their days on this Earth.''
</P>
<P>
Smith said that after the explosion, he began calling his wife
Monica's office. ``There was no answer, and there would never be an
answer.''
</P>
<P>
As people wept silently in the courtroom, Smith told of buying baby
furniture, of his despair at knowing his wife would not ever be able
to hold her son in her arms.
</P>
<P>
``All this because ... four men wanted to terrorize the United
States,'' he said.

 Pentagon Brass Tied to Firm That Sold U.S. Faulty Parts (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four federal agencies are examining allegations that
the Air Force sold useless fighter cockpit displays by a California
defense contractor whose board members at the time included William
Perry, now secretary of defense, and two other top Pentagon officials.
</P>
<P>
Under scrutiny is a 1987-91 contract between the Air Force and
Scientific Applications International Corp., based in San Diego .
During those four years, its high-powered board of directors included
Perry; John Deutch, now the deputy secretary of defense, and Anita
Jones, the new director of defense research and engineering.
</P>
<P>
After inquiries by Newsday, the three Clinton administration
officials recused themselves from control over the Pentagon portion of
the SAIC probe. The company paid a total of almost $900,000 in
severance payments to Perry, Deutch and Jones when they left the
company to join the Pentagon in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The investigation involves Air Force payment of $9.2 million,
primarily for F-15 fighter cockpit displays that SAIC made partially
from tiny Japanese television screens that cost only $650 each.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 20 cockpit indicators that were supposed to show
whether the plane was climbing or diving were made from color liquid
crystal displays, or LCDs. None of the 20 cockpit LCDs ever worked
properly.
</P>
<P>
While SAIC charges to the Air Force are one facet of the
investigation, court records and subsequent depositions obtained by
federal officials indicated that the investigation may hinge on SAIC
promises that the cockpit displays could become operable if the Air
Force paid an additional $320,000 for work on the project in 1991.
Former SAIC employees contend the company knew at the time that the
displays could not be fixed, federal investigators said.
</P>
<P>
Despite SAIC's failures with LCDs for cockpit displays, the LCD
technology has become a top priority for the Clinton administration's
Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department, two Pentagon investigative agencies and the
U.S. Attorney's office in San Diego have seized two truckloads of
documents relating to SAIC executives and board members. SAIC
President Lorenz Kull denied allegations of fraud made by company
whistleblowers.
</P>
<P>
``I think that was a bum rap,'' Kull said of the allegations of the
former employees.
</P>
<P>
Perry, Deutch and Jones refused Newsday's repeated requests to be
interviewed about their possible involvement with the contract. But in
a Pentagon statement to Newsday issued in their behalf, the three
recused themselves from the SAIC investigation.
</P>
<P>
``If the report comes to their offices for action, they will ask
the secretary of the Army to review it on their behalf,'' the Pentagon
said. Kathleen deLaski, the Pentagon spokeswoman, said the decision to
have Army Secretary Togo West oversee the issue was taken after
Newsday inquiries.
</P>
<P>
Interviews in San Diego and Washington provided a glimpse inside
the often secret world of defense companies that employ influential
politicians, retired military officers and scientists who at one time
or another pass through the Pentagon's revolving door.
</P>
<P>
When Perry, Deutch and Jones left the company for the Pentagon,
SAIC paid them $891,763 in severance fees. The payments, particularly
to Perry and Jones, were surprisingly high but reflected SAIC's
repurchase of privately held company stock issued to officials over
seven years of service as directors According to disclosure statements
filed with the Senate Armed Services Committee, Perry was entitled to
fees and stock from SAIC worth $354,474; Deutch, $456,591; and Jones,
$80,698.
</P>
<P>
Agents of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations and the
Defense Criminal Investigative Service took part in a federal raid on
five SAIC buildings last Feb. 15.
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Kull, the SAIC president, said that Perry, Deutch
and Jones were not involved in the contract, which was a relatively
small part of the company's $1.2 billion-a-year operation. The
Pentagon statement on the investigation made the same point. ``Dr.
Perry, Mr. Deutch and Dr. Jones did not have any personal involvement
relative to the Air Force contract during their service on the SAIC
board,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Whistleblower allegations led to the sweep by the U.S. Attorney's
office in San Diego. With search warrants, federal agents entered the
offices of Kull, board Chairman J.R. Beyster, as well as the legal
counsel and company officials involved in the Air Force contract.
</P>
<P>
Seized were 85 boxes containing 180,000 documents, including
records relating to the board of directors.
</P>
<P>
The documents seized from SAIC are still being computerized to
facilitate a detailed examination. One federal investigator who spoke
on condition he not be identified said, however, that Perry, Deutch,
Jones ``and the rest of the board are responsible for SAIC's
activities, and this was a very important new technology.''
</P>
<P>
In 1990, while Perry, Deutch and Jones were still on the board, the
U.S. Attorney's office won a conviction of the corporation on charges
of fraud in connection with altered lab tests by SAIC on
hazardous-waste sites. The company was fined $1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
According to an investigator, Air Force dismay over the cockpit
displays first surfaced in 1991, while all three current Pentagon
officials were on the board. ``There were plenty of red flags for top
management and board members,'' the investigator said.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
In April, the Pentagon announced a $580 million subsidy program for
U.S. companies willing to enter the flat-panel LCD production
industry. ``These screens are becoming increasingly critical to the
military to display information which we need to give us an advantage
in combat,'' Perry said in a May 5 speech.
</P>
<P>
But even before the new administration came to office, the Air
Force had planned to use four-by-four-inch LCD panels -- primarily on
F-15 Eagle fighters -- to replace horizontal indicators, a vital
cockpit display that shows whether the plane is going up or down.
After years of promises and demands for more money by SAIC's
technology division, however, the Air Force ended the project with an
angry letter to the company.
</P>
<P>
``None of the displays worked,'' said an Air Force official who
spoke on condition he not be identified. He worked on the program at
the Air Logistics Center at Robins Air Force Base, Ga.
</P>
<P>
Although the $9.2 million contract was small in Pentagon terms,
investigators said it involved development of one of the first
military flat-panel LCDs.
</P>
<P>
But SAIC had to scramble when potential U.S. suppliers failed to
supply their engineers with LCD screens for the Air Force cockpit
displays.
</P>
<P>
According to federal investigators, the company purchased Sharp,
Hitachi and other Japanese-made LCD television monitors at Target
Stores in the San Diego area. According to one Sharp official, the
screens retail for $650.
</P>
<P>
At SAIC, Kull said the controversy involved a legitimate dispute
with the Air Force over a difficult development project that ran out
of federal support before the cockpit displays were workable.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Kull told Newsday that SAIC informed the Air Force
in writing that the preliminary cockpit displays were made with LCDs
from Sharp and other commercial products. ``They (the Air Force) knew
what it was and they wanted to see what it would look like, to get a
feel,'' Kull said. He also said the LCDs in question were purchased
directly from the producers, not dismantled from discount store
television sets.
</P>
<P>
Perry served in a top Pentagon post during the Carter
administration. He joined the Clinton administration as deputy
secretary until he was elevated earlier this year with the departure
of Les Aspin as the defense chief.
</P>
<P>
Along with Deutch and Jones, Perry has been an adviser to the
defense community for years. All three are tenured science professors
at major universities. Their technical insights and Pentagon
connections enabled companies such as SAIC to be years ahead of
competitors for the $38 billion the Pentagon is spending -- under the
direction of Jones -- on research and development.
</P>
<P>
In addition to preparing for war, a major duty for all three is
leading an endless battle against waste, fraud and abuse by defense
contractors that have cost taxpayers billions of dollars.

 Calling Out the Heavy Artillery (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Science Applications International Corp. runs
afoul of federal laws, it is quick to insist that its influential
board of directors and top executives are not involved in the
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
But once U.S. law enforcement agents move against the government
contractor, based in San Diego, the company's board members are rolled
into position in Washington like heavy artillery.
</P>
<P>
Take the 1988 federal indictment of six employees on charges they
improperly reported lab tests on hazardous-waste site samples for the
Enviromental Protection Agency. The six employees pleaded guilty and
the San Diego U.S. attorney's office moved to indict the corporation
because of the severity of the fraud.
</P>
<P>
According to the government, the employees were victims of
corporate greed, ``lambs thrown to the wolves and then the corporation
walks out of here,'' the government said in a federal court statement.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, former Defense Secretary Melvin Laird, a member of the
company's board, wrote then-Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, asking
him to halt prosecution of the company. ``I can assure you there was
no wrongdoing on the part of the corporation,'' said Laird, defense
chief under President Nixon.
</P>
<P>
The letter was made public by the Project on Government Oversight,
a private watchdog group, which passed the documents on to
congressional investigators. In the face of the disclosures,
Thornburgh went ahead with the indictment and the company pleaded
guilty to 10 felony counts of fraud.
</P>
<P>
The company was fined $1.3 million in 1991, the largest fine
connected with the hazardous-waste program.

 U.S., Japan Differ on Trade Talk Agreement (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. and Japanese officials offered starkly different
interpretations Tuesday of their agreement ending a three-month
stalemate in trade negotiations, even as both sides hailed it as a
major breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
While U.S. officials said they had won Japan's commitment to use
``objective criteria'' to measure progressin opening specific sectors
of the Japanese market, including automobiles, auto parts,
communications and medical equipment, Japanese officials stressed that
progress in those areas was not a primary goal.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Japanese officials challenged the U.S. assertion that
the two sides had agreed to a ``results-oriented'' approach -- one that
stresses sales of foreign products in Japan -- to resolving their trade
differences.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese officials said the most significant part of the accord
was an explicit assurance that the United States would not rely solely
on numerical targets to measure Japanese progress.
</P>
<P>
U.S. negotiators minimized that provision, saying it was something
they had never sought.
</P>
<P>
Japanese have a favorite word to describe such vague agreements -- 
 tama-mushi iro, or having the color of the tama mushi, a common
Japanese beetle. The translucent wings of the tama mushi can seem
green or blue-or some other color entirely-depending on the light and
the viewer's perspective.
</P>
<P>
Japanese often use such ambiguity to paper over frictions and
maintain harmony in important relationships. But in the case of
Washington and Tokyo, such fuzziness seems to be breeding only greater
enmity.
</P>
<P>
Once again, it would seem, officials from two countries are looking
at the same beetle, but each seems to believe it has a completely
different hue.
</P>
<P>
The divergent visions of the accord, hammered out after five days
of feverish negotiations and numerous phone calls between top level of
officials in Washington and Tokyo, typified the sort of ambiguity and
confusion that has clouded relations between world's two largest
economies for much of the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Further, it casts doubt on President Clinton's pledge to transform
the nature of the U.S. effort to open the Japanese market.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the agreement announced Tuesday seems to do little more
than return the United States and Japan to the point at which their
trade negotiations started in Tokyo in July, when Clinton pressed
Japan's then-prime minister Kiichi Miyazawa into signing a ``framework
agreement'' to begin a much-ballyhooed market opening effort that
Clinton administration officials said would mark the beginning of a
new era in Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
But those talks bogged down almost as soon as they were launched as
it became clear that both sides had come away from the Tokyo meeting
with starkly divergent visions of just what had been agreed to.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's agreement clears the way for those talks to resume soon,
although the time and place of the next session has yet to be
determined.
</P>
<P>
In addition, there is no deadline for concluding the talks and no
sanction for failing to do so, although both sides will have to make a
public account of their progress when Clinton meets the Japanese prime
minister at the Group of Seven summit in Naples in July.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said Tuesday that negotiators now had clarified
several of the key flaws of the language of last July's agreement.
</P>
<P>
But the statements of officials on both sides left considerable
room for skepticism about that claim.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, a Japanese foreign ministry spokesman in Washington
seemed to suggest that the greatest achievement of the accord was less
a clarification of these points than an agreement to get the two
countries back to the bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
``The important thing is to get past this metaphysical debate-what
is what and what is not what-and get the working groups back
together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
``As a practical matter,'' one senior administration official said,
``the metaphysical debate is finished.''
</P>
<P>
Many analysts agreed that that was the real significance of the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The negotiators ``simply wanted to start up the framework talks
again and they needed some rationale ... .'' said Alan Tonelson,
research director at the Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington
think tank that has advocated taking a firm stand with Japan on trade
issues.
</P>
<P>
``They are not agreeing to the kind of provisions that would give
this agreement meaning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, U.S. trade negotiators sought to portray the agreement as
an important victory, saying the Japanese had agreed to a solution
that followed almost precisely a U.S. proposal U.S. Trade
Representative Mickey Kantor made last month to then-foreign minister
Tsutomu Hata, who is now prime minister, at a meeting in Morocco.
</P>
<P>
One negotiator boasted that the United States had broken the
deadlock without giving in on ``any U.S. negotiating position.''
</P>
<P>
But that claim underscores the point that the United States has
spent almost an entire year wrangling with Japan over the wording of
its bargaining arrangements even as Japan's trade surplus with the
United States remains enormous.
</P>
<P>
The real issue appears to be one of trust. As Hata told Kantor in a
late-night meeting in Washington in February, just between talks
between Clinton and Hosokawa broke down: ``The trouble is we can't
trust you with numbers and you can't trust us without them.''

 Each Trade Center Bomber Sentenced to 240 Years in Jail (New York) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Calculating a year in prison for each year of life lost
in the World Trade Center bombing, a judge Tuesday sentenced the four
convicted conspirators to die behind bars.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Court Judge Kevin Duffy called the bombers ``sneakin'
cowards'' and said they planned to bring down both towers ``like
dominoes'' and kill everyone inside the buildings with cyanide gas.
</P>
<P>
``My intention is you stay there for the rest of your life,'' said
a stern, disgusted Duffy. ``What you sought to do in the name of Islam
is what the Koran forbids.'' He quoted a section of the Muslim holy
book: ``These righteous people shall not be denied their reward. Allah
knows the righteous.''
</P>
<P>
The lengthy, daylong sentencing began with Edward Smith, husband of
blast victim Monica Smith, exhorting the judge to hand down the
harshest sentences possible. Then, one by one, the four Muslim men
convicted March 4 of the bombing defiantly declared their innocence
and were handed the same sentence.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Salameh, Nidal Ayyad, Mahmud Abouhalima and Ahmad Ajaj
each was sentenced to serve 240 years, a sum Duffy calculated by
combining the average life expectancy of each of the six people killed
in the blast -- 180 years -- plus 30 years on each additional count.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's sentencing brought to a close the first chapter in the
tale of terrorism that culminated Feb. 26, 1993, when a bomb rocked
the Trade Center, killing six, injuring 1,000 and causing more than
$500 million in damage.
</P>
<P>
Marshals lined the back of the standing-room-only courtroom
throughout the day. The only supporters present -- Ayyad's father and
Abouhalima's wife and sister-in-law -- listened silently to the
statements and sentences. The four men, shackled and dressed in brown
prison jumpsuits, were taken from the courtroom. They were expected to
be returned to the federal penitentiary in Lewisburg, Pa., Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday morning, when Smith read his statement, none of the four
raised their eyes to look at him. Smith described how he and his wife,
who was six months' pregnant when she was killed, happily anticipated
the birth of their son and how he learned of her death.
</P>
<P>
``Remember that these crimes are not, in the end, about a VIN
(vehicle identification) number found in rubble or chemical swabs
taken from a storage locker,'' said Smith. ``Remember that this
bombing was an act of multiple murder.''
</P>
<P>
Then Salameh, 26, who drove the bomb-laden Ryder van into the Trade
Center garage, stood and spoke in Arabic, which was translated for the
judge. The mostly unemployed undocumented alien from Jordan called the
trial ``unjust'' and hailed terrorist organizations around the world,
praising Islamic fundamentalist guerrillas in Egypt, Algeria and
``occupied Palestine.''
</P>
<P>
``I am not going to plead for mercy. (If) I had been judged
truthfully, I would accept the truth. I will rise above pleading for
mercy on falsehood,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Duffy, who maintained a casual if caustic demeanor during the
six-month trial, was visibly angry, glaring down from the bench.
``Allah knows the righteous,'' he said to Salameh. ``Not you.''
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Duffy was equally stern with Ayyad, 26, a Rutgers graduate,
chemical engineer and naturalized U.S citizen from Kuwait. ``You are
the biggest hypocrit in this room,'' Duffy said. ``You are clearly the
most culpable. You had the most breaks. You came to this country. You
had a chance to do something with your life. What right do you have to
talk about God? You talk about Islam. You have shamed it.''
</P>
<P>
Abouhalima, 34, the cab driver from Egypt, spent most of his
lengthy address describing his arrest and torture in Egypt and what he
considered Duffy's failure to provide a fair trial. He criticized the
jury, the values of American men ``who worship money'' and ``only see
women by their thighs.'' Abouhalima fled the United States four days
after the bombing and was arrested a week later at his father's home
near Cairo, Egypt.
</P>
<P>
At the end of his statement, Abouhalima suggested the assembled
spectators pray together. ``There is one god, Allah. Mohammed is the
prophet of us all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
``You are a convicted felon,'' Duffy said to Abouhalima. ``This is
not some guy on a vacation. You were convicted and justly convicted.''
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Ajaj, 27, the final defendant, was in federal prison the day of the
bombing. A Palestinian, he had been caught at Kennedy Airport Sept. 1,
1992, trying to slip into the country with a phony passport. Ajaj was
trying to bring bomb manuals into the country for the other
conspirators. His traveling companion was Ramzi Yousef, an alleged
bomber who remains a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
Ajaj carried on a filibuster for nearly three hours, detailing the
history of Palestine from 1917 through President Clinton's foreign
policy. He said he had been unjustly convicted. ``Up to this very
moment, I do not know where the World Trade Center is. I did not know
where the World Trade Center is located. It did not concern me.''
</P>
<P>
Duffy finally cut him off and handed him his 240 years. All four
are expected to file an appeal of their convictions.

 Contraband Sails Into Haiti Despite Embargo (Jacmel) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
JACMEL, Haiti
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite a reinforced U.N. embargo that went into
effect Sunday, a flotilla of ships carrying contraband has sailed into
this port city, carrying merchandise including gasoline, cars and
color television sets.
</P>
<P>
Local residents said at least nine ships have docked since the
strengthened embargo started, in theory barring everything except
pre-approved shipments of food, medicine and propane gas. Five
remained Monday, and army officers directed trucks onto the docks to
unload the merchandise.
</P>
<P>
The embargo was imposed in October and reinforced by the U.N.
Security Council on Sunday in an effort to force the military to allow
the return of ousted president Jean-Bertrand Aristide. He was
overthrown in a military coup in September 1991, six months after
becoming Haiti's first democratically elected leader.
</P>
<P>
The ships, which flew British, Jamaican, Colombian, Dominican,
Bahamian and Haitian flags, demonstrated how difficult it could be to
enforce the measure, especially since the ships largely ply the waters
between Haiti and the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
``So far, the ships have been triple-parked out there,'' said one
longtime resident, watching as ships bobbed, waiting to be unloaded.
``It has been years since the port was that busy.''
</P>
<P>
Diplomats involved in monitoring the embargo said it could take
weeks to figure out how to plug its leaks, and admitted that the
officers who control the contraband could build up substantial
stockpiles in the meantime. This means the measure would not really
begin to have an impact on the rich and on the officer corps for
several weeks, they said.
</P>
<P>
But it is a question whether the wealthy or the officer corps will
suffer. While reporters watched, uniformed army officers supervised
the unloading of a truckload of color televisions and other electronic
goods. At the port entrance, a small market has sprung up, and
residents said there had been an influx of prostitutes to keep pace
with the growing number of ships.
</P>
<P>
Residents said that at times over the weekend there were nine
tanker trucks on the dock getting fuel from tanks on visiting ships.
Other ships unloaded vehicles and luxury goods. The Bahamian-flagged
Sea Search, a seagoing tug that on Saturday was engaged by a U.S.
picket ship enforcing the embargo, was in port here Monday, its
barrels of fuel being unloaded under the supervision of military
officers.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said an armed fight nearly broke out in the stately La
Jacmelienne Hotel here Saturday night when a subordinate of powerful
police commander Lt. Col. Michel Francois, identified as Maj. Oiseau,
arrived with several other officers to supervise the unloading of
fuel.
</P>
<P>
According to several accounts, the owner of the hotel refused
Oiseau a room for the night because he and the other officers were not
paying for food or drinks. Oiseau reportedly began waving a gun around

brought out a gun. Only the intervention of Col. Lyonel Sylvain, the
regional commander, avoided a major shootout, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The witnesses, who asked not to be identified for their personal
safety, said another ship, the Oakleigh, flying the Union Jack and
registered in Aberdeen, Scotland, made several trips a week over the
last several months to the Dominican Republic, bringing back about
15,000 gallons of fuel at a time.
</P>
<P>
Residents here and knowledgeable sources in Port-au-Prince, the
capital, said much of the Jacmel fuel flow is controlled by an
important fuel wholesaler named Gerald Caroli. Knowledgeable sources
said Caroli is a major fuel supplier of the U.S. Embassy and other
diplomatic missions.
</P>
<P>
While ships were unloaded, a Dominican vessel sat about a mile from
the dock, abandoned because its captain, known only as ``Dirty
Harry,'' fled for his life when the buyers of his fuel found some of
the diesel was full of sludge and unusable.

 Expert Urges Use of Old Techniques to Fight Superbugs (New York) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A top cancer expert said Tuesday health officials facing
increasing antibiotic resistance among disease microbes should
consider returning to techniques that were abandoned when antibiotics
first came of age in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Matthew Scharff, director of the Albert Einstein Medical
School's Cancer Center in New York City, urged the medical
establishment to shift some of the emphasis from developing antibiotic
drugs to producing antisera made of human antibodies. This, he said,
could address two overlapping concerns: the rising number of severely
immune-deficient patients, and the rapid growth of so-called superbugs
that are resistant to many, or in some cases all, types of
antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
When antisera was used extensively against meningococcal meningitis
in the 1920s, Scharff said, it had a 30 percent success rate. ``It was
highly statistically significant,'' he said. ``It was a successful
treatment.''
</P>
<P>
Today, though, new technology exists that might make such antisera
a more successful option where antibiotics fail, Scharff said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before a New York City gathering of the Irvington Trust,
an investment banking group that funds medical research, Scharff said
patients who undergo cancer chemotherapy, transplant surgery,
radiation or who have AIDS commonly die of what, for other people, are
fairly benign fungal and bacterial infections -- including
staphylococcus, meningococcus, pneumococcus and cryptococcus.
</P>
<P>
``In the absence of our own immunity, even antibiotics cannot kill
these agents,'' Scharff said.
</P>
<P>
About 10 percent of all people with AIDS, for instance, die from
antibiotic-resistant cryptococcus, a ubiquitous fungus that causes
meningitis. Similarly, a variety of bacterial infections are
essentially incurable in cancer lymphoma patients: Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis died partly as a result of such an opportunistic, untreatable
bacterial infection.
</P>
<P>
In the the 1920s and 1930s, before the discovery of antibiotics,
physicians treated such problems with antisera created by injecting
samples of the bacteria plaguing their patients into a horse. The
horse's immune system reacted by making antibodies, which doctors then
withdrew from the horse's blood.
</P>
<P>
After purifying the antibodies, physicians then injected the
antisera into their human patients in order to give their immune
systems a better chance to fight off the original bacterial threat.
</P>
<P>
The biggest drawback was that humans often developed acute allergic
responses to horse proteins found in the antisera. Now, though,
so-called monoclonal antibodies are already in use for other medical
purposes, and the techniques for making pure antibodies are
well-established, Scharff said.
</P>
<P>
He said he and his colleagues have already made pure human antisera
against cryptococcus in test tubes that cured mice.
</P>
<P>
``I think we should look back at this,'' Scharff added. ``We have
to. We have nothing else.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Dr. Mark Jacobson, of the University of California, San Francisco,
however, said there are major questions about whether such a treatment
 -- which could cost $3,000 -- would be cost effective since it would be
helpful only to a small number of people.
</P>
<P>
About half of all AIDS patients recover from cryptococcus while on
antibiotics, Jacobsen said.
</P>
<P>
Scharff and his colleague Arturo Casadevall have met with several
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, hoping to find interest in
the antisera concept. So far, there is no interest because the market
is small.

 Researchers Study Whether Viruses Trigger Schizophrenia (Baltimore) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BALTIMORE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jumping into one of the liveliest debates in
psychiatry, researchers at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions will
investigate an unconventional theory that viruses or other infectious
agents trigger schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
The project, made possible by a $7 million grant from the private
Theodore and Vada Stanley Foundation of Arlington, Va., is a large
effort considering its speculative focus. It will involve nine faculty
members and nine research ``fellows'' to be recruited over three
years.
</P>
<P>
Most schizophrenia studies have been dominated by research
psychiatrists and geneticists, but this one will be centered in the
department of pediatric infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
``I wouldn't say that's unusual -- I'd say it's unheard of,'' said
Dr. E. Fuller Torrey, a clinical and research psychiatrist in
Washington, D.C., who runs the Stanley Foundation's Research Program
on Serious Mental Illnesses.
</P>
<P>
``This is not traditional mainstream psychiatric research,'' said
Torrey, adding that the theory was more popular 60 years ago than it
is today.
</P>
<P>
The study is based on the theory that exposure to an infectious
agent in the womb or in early childhood produces the brain
abnormalities responsible for schizophrenia later in life. One
possibility is that an infection interacts with heredity to cause the
disease.
</P>
<P>
Schizophrenia, the most common psychotic illness, with 1.5 million
sufferers in the United States alone, usually does not manifest itself
until the teens or early twenties.
</P>
<P>
It often causes people to hear strange voices, to withdraw socially
and to sink into disturbed thinking and disjointed, jumbled speech.
Medications can reduce symptoms, but victims frequently have trouble
holding jobs, maintaining friendships and functioning independently.
</P>
<P>
Torrey, speaking at a news briefing Tuesday, said the idea that
infections lie at the root of schizophrenia emerged early in the
century when many people who caught influenza in the great flu
epidemic of 1918 developed symptoms similar to those of schizophrenia
and mania, another mental disorder.
</P>
<P>
The notion fell out of favor as psychiatry became dominated by the
idea that mental illnesses -- including schizophrenia -- are caused by
poor parenting or other troubling experiences in life.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, however, the field has come full circle -- 
dominated now by evidence that severe mental disorders are diseases of
the brain.
</P>
<P>
The Hopkins study will be the largest into a viral cause, Torrey
said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, many researchers have focused on the role played
by genetics. The disease often runs in families, and in some cases
afflicts a startling number of family members within the span of a few
generations.
</P>
<P>
But the thesis that schizophrenia is inherited is far from settled.
While a third of schizophrenics have one or more close relatives with
the disease, the rest have no such family history.
</P>
<P>
If the disease were purely genetic, it would never afflict one
identical twin and not the other since the siblings have virtually the
same genetic makeup. But studies of identical twins have shown that
the disease is shared only 30 percent to 50 percent of the time in
remaining cases, only one twin is afflicted.
</P>
<P>
Evidence linking viruses or other infectious agents to
schizophrenia is purely circumstantial, Torrey said. Some studies, for
instance, have found high levels of antibodies to certain viruses in
the spinal fluid of schizophrenic patients.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Also, numerous studies have shown that people born in the late
winter and early spring -- when common viral illnesses are at their
peak -- have a greater chance of developing the disease than those born
at other times of year. This has fueled speculation that the disease
can be traced to a viral illness in infancy or during a prenatal
stage.
</P>
<P>
It is possible that some people carry genes that made them
vulnerable to an infection or its complications, said Dr. Robert H.
Yolken, chief of pediatric infectious diseases and the study's
director.
</P>
<P>
``Infections and genetics are not mutually exclusive,'' he said.

 Principal Allows `Zoot Suit' Showing but Nobody Shows Up (San Diego) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SAN DIEGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The principal at a suburban high school who had blocked
the showing of ``Zoot Suit'' a month ago relented and was prepared
Tuesday night to show the movie on campus. There was only one problem:
Not a single student showed up to see it.
</P>
<P>
Terrie Pennock, principal of Santana High School in Santee, said
she still believes the movie does not fit the school's 11th-grade
American literature curriculum. But she said she had been willing to
show the film to dispel any erroneous impression that her earlier
action was racist or censorial.
</P>
<P>
``Racism and censorship are the kinds of things I became an
educator to fight,'' Pennock said.
</P>
<P>
Attendance at the 7 p.m. showing was to have been optional and open
only to the 125 students from five American literature classes who had
their parents' permission. School rules require such permission when
any R-rated movie is shown.
</P>
<P>
Reiko Obata, the teacher who had wanted to show ``Zoot Suit'' and
had clashed with the principal and the chairwoman of the English
Department, remains suspended with pay.
</P>
<P>
Obata said her former students probably stayed away in a display of
solidarity with her. But Pennock said the no-show was probably an
indication that interest was never as high as Obata had suggested.
</P>
<P>
Obata and Pennock remain at odds over Obata's suspension.
</P>
<P>
Pennock said Obata was not suspended because of the ``Zoot Suit''
clash but rather for other reasons that Pennock could not discuss
because of a law requiring confidentiality in school personnel cases.
</P>
<P>
Obata has a one-semester contract as a fill-in teacher. Two days
after Pennock denied permission for ``Zoot Suit,'' Obata was ordered
to go home for the rest of the semester.
</P>
<P>
Obata said she was told by an assistant superintendent that she was
being suspended for going over the head of the department chairwoman
to seek permission to show the film. However, there are no documents
to verify that.
</P>
<P>
In the controversy that followed Obata's suspension, ``Zoot Suit''
star Edward James Olmos, the movie's writer and director Luis Valdez,
and a variety of Latino activists, civil libertarians and educators
issued statements supporting her. Valdez said he was ``appalled by the
bigotry and censorship'' at the school.
</P>
<P>
Pennock said the original decision was made because ``Zoot Suit''
was not suitable for use in the manner that Obata had wanted: to
prepare students for ``The House on Mango Street,'' a short-story
collection by Sandra Cisneros.
</P>
<P>
A better introduction for the Cisnernos' book, Pennock said, is the
movie that has since been used by the substitute hired to take Obata's
place, ``Stand By Me,'' also starring Olmos.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Both ``Stand By Me'' and ``The House on Mango Street'' deal with
Latino students struggling successfully against adversity, Pennock
said, while ``Zoot Suit'' deals with a murder trial, racial clashes
and institutional racism.
</P>
<P>
```There is nothing wrong with `Zoot Suit,' '' Pennock said, ``but
it is not a lead-in for `Mango Street.' ''
</P>
<P>
Valdez was unavailable for comment Tuesday. Phil Esparza, associate
producer of ``Zoot Suit'' and Valdez's artistic collaborator for 25
years, said that it was unfortunate that it took a public controversy
``to get this minimal action'' by the principal.

 GOP Gains Kentucky House Seat Natcher Held 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republican Ron Lewis Tuesday broke a 129-year Democratic hold on a
central Kentucky congressional district, revealing for the second time
in three weeks the dangers facing Democrats running in conservative
southern and border states and the liabilities of President Clinton in
these electorates.
</P>
<P>
With 100 percent of the vote counted, Lewis, a fundamentalist
Christian minister and bookstore owner, had 55 percent to Democrat Joe
Prather's 45 percent. Until Lewis, whose campaign was aided by
$200,000 from national GOP committees, began his assault on Prather
and Clinton, the Democrat had been the strong favorite to win the seat
that had been held for 41 years by Rep. William H. Natcher, who died
March 29. Democrats now hold a 256 to 178 advantage over the
Republicans in the House. There is one independent.
</P>
<P>
``Everywhere I went through the district there were people upset,''
Lewis declared. ``They actually were mad. ... They felt like they
needed to do something and say something that would change lives.''
</P>
<P>
Rep. Bill Paxon, N.Y., chairman of the National Republican
Comgressional Committee, declared that the results are ``a big defeat
for the president and the Democrats in Congress, and a warning message
to Democrats that 1994 is going to be a Republican year.''
</P>
<P>
A mobilization effort by the Christian right also helped Lewis, and
its success also augurs badly for Democrats. Twenty-one Democrats
retired this year, and 11 of them represent southern or border state
districts where the Christian right is strong.
</P>
<P>
Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., chairman of the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee, sought to play down the significance of the Lewis
victory. ``The outcome was not about message, it was about tactics,''
Fazio said, referring to Prather's decision to run a low key campaign
and the low turnout in which strong Christian mobilization and the
intense GOP media effort paid off.
</P>
<P>
In his commercials, Lewis charged that Democratic nominee Prather
was cut from the same mold as Clinton. His TV commercials stated
repeatedly that, ``Kentucky doesn't need Joe Prather. Send a message
to Bill Clinton. Send Ron Lewis to Congress. Ron Lewis, he's one of
us.'' As television screens showed pictures of Clinton and Prather
melding into each other, the announcer declared: ``In Frankfort
(Kentucky's capital), Joe Prather votes to increase taxes and fees
over 40 times. . . . Bill Clinton passes the largest tax increase in
history. . . . If you like Bill Clinton, you'll love Joe Prather.
Kentucky doesn't need another professional politician.''
</P>
<P>
The Lewis victory comes on the heels of the victory of Republican
Frank Lucas in a once rock-solid Democratic district in Oklahoma.
Lucas succeeds Rep. Glenn English (D), who resigned.
</P>
<P>
While the 2nd Congressional District in Kentucky has been
represented by Democrats for more than a century, it clearly has moved
toward the GOP in its presidential voting. In 1992, President George
Bush outpolled Clinton there by 45 to 41 percent, and in 1988, Bush
crushed Democratic presidential nominee Michael S. Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
The Lewis-Prather special election was the only
Republican-Democratic contest Tuesday, although the policies of the
Clinton administration were at issue in a number of primaries in
Kentucky, Arkansas and Idaho. In the 1st District of Kentucky just to
the west of the 2nd District, freshman Rep. Tom Barlow crushed a
challenge by fellow Democrat and state Sen. Henry Lackey. Barlow got
60 percent and Lackey 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the nearby 3rd District, former state representative Mike Ward
won a 10-way race for the Democratic nomination to succeed Rep. Romano
L. Mazzoli (D), who is retiring after 24 years. Former state
representative Susan B. Stokes, who ran for the seat and lost in 1992,
defeated two others for the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
In Idaho, Democratic Attorney General Larry EchoHawk is favored to
win his party's nomination in his drive to become the nation's first
American Indian governor. Gov. Cecil D. Andrus (D) is retiring after
four terms. Republican primary voters were expected to pick Phil Batt,
a former state senator and lieutenant governor, to oppose EchoHawk.
</P>
<P>
Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker (D), who succeeded Clinton after the
1992 presidential election, is unopposed in the Democratic
gubernatorial primary. Sheffield Nelson, one of Clinton's harshest
critics, was trailing state Sen. Steve Luelf for the GOP nomination
</P>
<P>
In a battle for the Democratic nomination in Arkansas' 4th
Congressional District, James McDougal, whose Whitewater real estate
development and savings and loan firm have been the subject of a
special counsel's investigation, trailed state Sen. Jay Bradford and
state Rep. John Parkerson. They were competing for the chance to take
on freshman Rep. Jay Dickey (R), who has no primary opposition.

 Rostenkowski Considers Felony Plea, Jail Time (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Defense attorneys for Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.,
are considering an agreement with federal prosecutors in which the
powerful House Ways and Means chairman would plead guilty to a felony
and serve some time in jail, if the government reduces the number and
scope of the charges against him, sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The options being discussed also include Rostenkowski's resignation
from Congress, sources said Tuesday. Although defense attorneys have
indicated that there may be room for compromise, a number of factors
have blocked a deal, particularly the question of jail time, which at
first Rostenkowski was said to oppose adamantly.
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski's attorneys have been pressing for days to narrow the
number of charges against him. Prosecutors have indicated that they
would compromise in this area, but they have remained firm that any
plea must include a felony charge and not just misdemeanors. One
source said that any guilty plea ``would have to incorporate certain
base line charges.''
</P>
<P>
Much of the haggling Tuesday centered on jail time, said one source
knowledgeable about the deliberations. Prosecutors want jail time as
part of any deal and are willing to be flexible only on the length of
the stay in prison. Rostenkowski's attorneys, who earlier had been
firm that Rostenkowski avoid prison, now are showing some flexibility
on the issue, sources said.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations continued Tuesday at a heated pitch with federal
prosecutors and defense attorneys still unable to finalize an
agreement. While progress has been made, the discussions could simply
fall apart, with prosecutors seeking an indictment this week, sources
said. Rostenkowski also reportedly wants to serve out the remainder of
his term, which may not be possible if there is a guilty plea. The
House would have to decide whether to expel Rostenkowski.
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys were publicly silent on the matter Tuesday, as
were prosecutors who had set this week as the point to seek an
indictment of Rostenkowski.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some House Republicans said they would call for hearings
if the Ways and Means Committee chairman received what they considered
too lenient a deal. However, politicians on Capitol Hill were offering
their opinions in increasing numbers, including House Minority Whip
Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
``Any plea bargain that was below some minimum standard would
automatically'' lead to Republican calls for Judiciary Committee
hearings, wire reports quoted Gingrich as saying.
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors have outlined a broad case of conspiracy to
defraud the government against Rostenkowski, including charges that
the veteran lawmaker paid employees for work not done, and that he
abused official accounts for leased cars, office supplies and office
space. He has publicly denied all the charges.

 MARKET BEAT: Why Bond Bulls Need to Wake Up and Smell the Coffee 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anyone trying to sell you a bond nowadays will tell you that the
recent jump in long-term interest rates is a false alarm, at least as
far as inflation is concerned. There is no inflation to speak of, the
bond bulls insist.
</P>
<P>
Unless, of course, you're a coffee drinker. The price of a pound of
coffee on futures markets has rocketed from 72 cents at the start of
the year to $1.33 now -- an 85 percent blip, and that the world economy
isn't strong enough to support higher raw materials prices, let alone
higher prices for finished goods.
</P>
<P>
Some contend commodities' recent gains are the work of professional
traders, not the result of ``real'' demand. There may be some truth to
that. Caroline Van, analyst at hedge-fund tracker International
Advisory Group in Nashville, Tenn., says her firm is increasingly
hearing from big investors who want to place money with hedge funds
that trade in commodities. ``They're interested in commodities as a
(new) asset class,'' Van says.
</P>
<P>
In Santa Monica, Calif., well-known hedge fund manager Mark Strome
believes metals such as copper, nickel and aluminum are poised for
dramatic price rises. ``I think this is the opportunity'' in
financial markets in '94, he says.
</P>
<P>
But for metals prices to surge, Strome concedes, real demand -- from
busier factories churning out more goods -- will have to be there
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Robert Genetski, who runs a Chicago-based economic advisory firm
bearing his name, predicts that the No. 1 surprise this year will be a
stronger U.S. economy than Wall Street now foresees. The Federal
Reserve Board, Genetski argues, allowed money to be so loose for so
long (1991 to 1993) that the seeds of robust future business and
consumer spending are already sown.
</P>
<P>
While the conventional wisdom is that the Fed's credit-tightening
moves this year will slow the economy, Genetski points to the surge in
bank loan demand from business borrowers in recent months as evidence
that the economic expansion is gaining steam, not losing it.
Commercial and industrial loans outstanding, which plunged from 1991
through '93, have jumped to $605 billion now from $585 billion at Jan.
1, even as rates have increased.
</P>
<P>
Higher demand for goods and services -- not just in America, but
also now in recovering Europe -- is what's behind the upward pressure
on prices of many once-glutted commodities, Genetski says. As those
higher prices stick, and work their way into the cost of products at
retail (like coffee), he believes the 2 percent to 3 percent inflation
of recent years will turn into 5 percent inflation in 1995 and 6
percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
What about global competition and rising productivity? Those
influences ought to suppress price increases, says investment
strategist Katherine Hensel at Lehman Bros. in New York. Plus, she
notes that raw materials generally account for only one-third of
manufacturing costs; labor is two-thirds, and there's certainly no
shortage of labor around the world, she adds.
</P>
<P>
Still, Genetski and other economy-bulls say the strength in
commodities this year is the inflation bell tolling -- softly so far,
but unmistakable.

 Million Dollar Prize Turns Into Teen-agers' Booby Trap (Los Angeles) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LOS ANGELES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sitting in the parking lot of a McDonald's in the Los
Angeles suburb of Norwalk on Easter Sunday, 1987, 17-year-old James V.
Beltran thought he held happiness in his hands.
</P>
<P>
He had just bought a Coke and picked up an instant game ticket
worth at least $1 million in a restaurant chain promotional contest
and he remembers feeling awestruck. ``I realized it would change my
life,'' he said. ``I thought it would make me the happiest person I
could be.''
</P>
<P>
There was just one problem that would cause Beltran's sweet
daydream to sour: as an assistant manager at the McDonald's in his
hometown of nearby Montebello, Beltran was ineligible to collect the
money. So, he asked 18-year-old Teresa J. Villafana, a friend at
Montebello High School, to claim the winning ticket in return for half
the $1,000 weekly before-tax proceeds. ``I totally trusted her,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
But the apparent good fortune of Villafana and Beltran quickly
turned bad, setting in motion a hellish swirl of greed, naivete and
dishonesty between two working-class teen-agers. Disagreements began
almost immediately, and in 1990 Villafana filed a lawsuit claiming
Beltran had broken their contract.
</P>
<P>
Now, seven years after Villafana's face was featured on McDonald's
posters in Latino neighborhoods as the lucky young woman who had
beaten the odds and won a lifetime income, the company also has filed
suit to make them give back more than $330,000. No one will say how,
but the company found out in February about the agreement to split the
winnings and filed a federal lawsuit in Los Angeles this month
charging that Villafana and Beltran had committed fraud.
</P>
<P>
The two said they no longer have the money.
</P>
<P>
``You can't get blood from a turnip,'' said Carolyn Olivares, who
with her husband, Tony, were Villafana's guardians until she moved out
of their Montebello townhouse soon after she began collecting the
prize money. ``There's nothing left.''
</P>
<P>
McDonald's spokesman Chuck Ebeling said the company filed the
lawsuit on principal, to ``see that the integrity of games or
sweepstakes that we are involved in is maintained.'' The money is also
important, he said, but ``it's really a question of protecting
participants' rights'' in contests.
</P>
<P>
The complaint filed by McDonald's contends Beltran broke the rules
because he was an employee and because he gave the ticket to
Villafana.
</P>
<P>
Attorney Ivan W. Halperin, who represents Beltran, said it will be
difficult for the company to prove its fraud claim. Beltran said he
obtained the ticket legitimately, winning against odds of 1 in
250,016,000, and that he did not know it was improper to give it to
Villafana. Halperin also said his client gave it to his friend on the
advice of his boss at McDonald's. ``With that set of facts, there's no
fraud here,'' Halperin said.
</P>
<P>
Villafana's attorney, Emilio T. Gurrola, declined to comment,
saying he was trying to negotiate a settlement with the restaurant
giant.
</P>
<P>
Villafana said in a brief telephone conversation that things had
not turned out as she hoped they would when Beltran came to her with
the proposed agreement. But she referred other questions to Gurrola.
</P>
<P>
Carolyn and Tony Olivares, Villafana's guardians, said arguments
between them and Villafana over how to handle the monthly checks for
$4,333.36 got so bad she moved out and didn't speak to them for a
year.
</P>
<P>
The problem, said Tony Olivares, was that both Beltran and
Villafana were young and had no clue about how to handle taxes,
insurance, or savings. Discussions over the money ``drove a wedge
between us at first because she didn't understand what we were trying
to do'' to help her, Carolyn Olivares said.
</P>
<P>
From the point she moved out, said Carolyn Olivares, ``it went
downhill very rapidly'' for Villafana.
</P>
<P>
She felt as if Beltran was bullying her and began to worry that
something wasn't right, according to legal papers that are part of the
Los Angeles County Superior Court lawsuit she filed against Beltran in
1990. And, she said, Beltran fed those worries by telling her that
what the two had conspired to do had been illegal and that she could
go to jail if it were discovered.
</P>
<P>
Villafana also said in legal papers that those fears caused her to
agree to Beltran's demands that she sign papers so that the insurance
company that issued the annuity would send a check directly to him,
with him promising to give her a share. Soon after, in 1989, Beltran
cut her off.
</P>
<P>
When Beltran stopped giving her money, Villafana's problems
mounted. She lost two apartments because she didn't pay the rent. Her
car, a Toyota Corolla she had purchased soon after receiving her first
check, was repossessed. A boyfriend ran up big bills on her credit
cards and then disappeared.
</P>
<P>
Her birth mother surfaced and asked for money to go to Mexico to
tend to Villafana's dying grandmother. Villafana fell behind in her
taxes and eventually had to work out a repayment agreement with the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
Although Beltran received far more money -- about $237,000 compared
to $94,000 for Villafana, he also has had difficulties.
</P>
<P>
He said problems began almost as soon as Villafana received the
first check in August 1987. In court papers, she said she made partial
payments to Beltran. The Olivareses said she paid Beltran in cash so
that he would not be connected to her when he cashed checks. But
Beltran now claims that he got almost nothing.
</P>
<P>
``I never thought she would do that, but I guess it's true that
money really does change you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
A year later, he persuaded Villafana to assign the annuity payments
to him. And, he acknowledged, once that happened he stopped splitting
the money with her. ``I felt no obligation to give her more,'' he said
in an interview.
</P>
<P>
In May 1992, a Superior Court judge endorsed an out-of-court
settlement of the lawsuit Villafana filed against Beltran that gave
him about three-quarters of the money. Villafana's share was to be
about a quarter of the money.
</P>
<P>
But, by then, the annuity had shrunk, too. The insurance company
that issued the annuity, Executive Life, had been forced by its own
financial problems to reorganize. As a result, the value of the
monthly check varied each month, dropping as low as $2,500.
</P>
<P>
In January, the money stopped altogether, because of Executive
Life's troubles. And in February, McDonald filed suit.
</P>
<P>
``They would have had it made,'' said Tony Olivares, shaking his
head in wonderment at how things turned out. ``There was enough money
for both of them.''

 WORLD REPORT: Threats to Withdraw U.N. Troops Stir Fears (Sarajevo) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Threats by Western countries to pull
U.N. troops out of embattled Bosnia may be as hard to deliver on as
earlier promises to protect civilians, but the prospect has
nevertheless stirred fears of devastating consequences for all of the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
As fighting in the region grinds through its third year and hopes
for a negotiated solution evaporate, fatigue and frustration have
prompted countries contributing troops to the U.N. command to impose
deadlines for a peaceful settlement or a pullout.
</P>
<P>
France has put UNPROFOR, the U.N. Protection Force, on notice that
it will cut its 6,800-troop contingent by 2,500, and Britain has
threatened to withdraw all 3,300 of its soldiers if the Bosnian
government and Serbian nationalist rebels have not made peace in two
months.
</P>
<P>
While those and similar warnings by other NATO-member countries
give the impression of a new, get-tough attitude with the Bosnian
combatants, the consequences of such a pullout could be lopsided and
would almost guarantee a widening of the war.
</P>
<P>
British Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, the U.N. commander for 15,000 troops
in Bosnia, said in interviews he is certain all sides recognize that a
pullout would lead to ``a nightmare scenario.''
</P>
<P>
``If we go, who is going to feed the 2.7 million people here who
are totally dependent on aid?'' Rose asked. ``Who is going to push the
peace process? The cease-fire in Sarajevo would unravel. Even in
central Bosnia, where there is already a political agreement, there is
the risk that everything would come unstuck.''
</P>
<P>
Without U.N. troops to protect aid convoys trying to reach hungry
civilians trapped behind the front lines, deliveries to besieged
pockets and this encircled capital city would have to stop, confirmed
Kris Janowski, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
Sarajevo, which the refugee agency uses as a base for feeding
440,000 Bosnians on both sides of the encircling confrontation line,
is served by a humanitarian airlift now operated and protected by U.N.
forces.
</P>
<P>
``If UNPROFOR pulled out, the airport would stop functioning and
there would probably be a huge escalation in the fighting,'' Janowski
predicted. ``And UNHCR cannot run an airlift under conditions of total
warfare.''
</P>
<P>
The eastern Bosnian pockets of Gorazde, Srebrenica and Zepa would
also likely lose their aid lifelines because there would be no U.N.
troops or armor to muscle deliveries through the Serbian rebel cordons
entrapping more than 150,000 people, mostly Muslims, in those
U.N.-designated havens.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and its aid agency have observed strict
neutrality throughout their nearly two years in Bosnia, feeding nearly
all of the population still left here after 200,000 deaths and the
flight to other countries of as many as half of the 2 million
displaced.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
But because the dependent Serbian civilians live in areas adjacent
to their patron state of Serbia or Croatian land conquered by fellow
Serbs during an earlier phase of the regional war, the nationalist
rebels have less at risk with the food pipeline if they defy the peace
deadline than the Muslim-led government, whose backers would be left
to starve.
</P>
<P>
Despite the inequity of aid deliveries that would result from a
U.N. withdrawal, officials of the Balkans force see counter-pressures
that they believe should compel the Serbian rebels to quit while they
are so far ahead and get what they can through negotiation.
</P>
<P>
``Implicit in a pullout is lifting of the arms embargo,'' one
officer said, pointing to the mounting pressures in Washington and
Western Europe to nullify a 1991 U.N. prohibition of arms deliveries
to what was then Yugoslavia but has since fractured into independent
republics, each of which holds widely disparate shares of the old
federation's weapon stockpile.
</P>
<P>
Serbia inherited the arsenal of tanks, heavy guns and aircraft that
belonged to the massive Yugoslav People's Army, the fourth-largest
force in Europe, which has given its Serbian rebel proxies in Bosnia
the military might to conquer more than 70 percent of this republic.
</P>
<P>
``If the U.N. is forced to leave, the chances of the Serbs getting
(U.N.-imposed economic) sanctions lifted is zero and they have to
worry about the Muslims being rearmed,'' another European officer
noted. ``In both respects, time would not be on the Serbs' side.''
</P>
<P>
Bosnia's Muslims and Croats had been fighting each other in a
war-within-a-war until March, when a U.S.-brokered agreement restored
their alliance against the Serbian land grab.
</P>
<P>
But the Serbs have so far refused to commit themselves to a
proposed Bosnian federation of ethnically based ministates, preferring
to press on with a quest to annex their conquered Bosnian territory to
a Greater Serbia.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Bosnian government have reacted with pique to the
threats of a pullout.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic denounced Britain's two-month
deadline as an attempt to force the leadership of a U.N.-member state
to cave in to its own destruction.
</P>
<P>
The United States recently joined Russia and nations of the
European Union (which formerly was known as the European Community) in
demanding that the Bosnian combatants accept an immediate cease-fire
and agree to a split of the territory that would give the Serbian
rebels internationally recognized authority over half of this
republic.
</P>
<P>
Some observers believe, though, that the threats are having the
desired effect of confronting the two sides with no other option but
to sit down and negotiate.
</P>
<P>
Mirko Pejanovic, a Bosnian vice president who is a non-nationalist
Serb, said he sees little chance of a U.N. pullout and growing signs
that the leadership is ready to compromise on the issue of how long
they will cease military activities to give the peace process a
chance.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers who met in Geneva insisted that both sides
agree to a four-month cease-fire and resume negotiations that
deadlocked early this year.
</P>
<P>
The Serbs insist that four months is too short, because they hope
to draw out the negotiations endlessly so as to strengthen their grip
on all the territory they now hold. The government, fearing that
delaying tactic, wants a finite term by which a fair settlement is
negotiated or the intransigent party punished for refusing to bargain
in good faith.
</P>
<P>
A well-known political analyst for the Sarajevo daily Oslobodjenje,
Merhet Husic, agrees the risk of a U.N. pullout is extremely slim.
</P>
<P>
``They're bluffing,'' he said of the British and French threats to
withdraw from Bosnia. ``They have to be here for the sake of their own
political futures. They don't care about Bosnia, but if they leave
this place while war continues, they would be admitting they are
nothing, that not even NATO can protect people from senseless
killing.''
</P>
<P>
Despite the obvious dangers of a U.N. pullout, officials warn that
political realities in the parliaments of Europe could pressure those
governments to put a limit on their patience and a mission whose costs
and casualties have become increasingly difficult to defend.
</P>
<P>
``There will come a stage where they have to say, `That's it,'''
Rose's aide, Lt. Col. Simon Shadbolt, said of the growing sentiment
for giving the combatants an ultimatum to make peace. ``We are not yet
at that stage, and the mission will continue. But if we have provided
the conditions for the peace process and both sides make clear they do
not want peace, there will come a stage where we have to ask ourselves
what the hell we're doing here.''

 Greek Embargo Plagues Macedonia (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SKOPJE, Macedonia
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To hear Macedonians on the streets of their
capital talk, the only ones suffering from the blockade Athens has
placed on this landlocked former Yugoslav republic are the Greeks
themselves.
</P>
<P>
``The Greeks are so dumb,'' jeered Emran Bajram, a taxi driver.
``They've lost all their Macedonian tourists to Turkey.'' He gestured
to a near-empty gas station. ``Look: There's no line. We always have
gas. When I need it, I just fill up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
``We can still get what we need from Turkey,'' said Irena
Dimitrieva, a travel agent. ``The only problem is that everybody would
love to go to Greece for holiday.''
</P>
<P>
Indeed, downtown shops are filled with everything from imported
cutlery to basketball shoes, and Macedonian women in the latest
Italian fashions still crowd Skopje's late-night discos.
</P>
<P>
But beneath the bravado and flashy goods, Macedonia stands to lose
far more than holidays on the Aegean. The trade blockade that Greece
imposed Feb. 16 to add economic pressure to a campaign to force
Macedonia to change its name, flag and constitution has left the
Skopje government struggling to prop up an increasingly weak economy,
and hoping it can contain nationalist sentiments that could tear the
country apart.
</P>
<P>
Greece has claimed that the name Macedonia and other symbols
adopted by the new country in 1991 are historically Greek, and that
their use reflects Skopje's designs on Greece's northern province,
also called Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
``If this embargo is prolonged, and if the economic difficulties
and tensions are increased, there is no guarantee that there won't be
an explosion here,'' President Kiro Gligorov warned during an
interview in his Skopje office.
</P>
<P>
Factories unable to obtain raw materials have shut down and many
planned enterprises aborted, exacerbating unemployment. Gligorov's
moderate but fragile coalition, facing elections in November, may fall
apart under nationalistic pressures, observers say. Fuel and other
prices are being kept artificially low by a government that is
mortgaging its future to shield its people temporarily from the
embargo's effects.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia's population of 2 million includes substantial Albanian
and Bulgarian minorities, and the region's conflicting territorial
claims have touched off two Balkan wars in this century.
</P>
<P>
``If this place comes apart, we have serious problems, because I
can't imagine it happening without seeing all the neighbors
involved,'' said Victor Comras, the U.S. government liaison to Skopje
and likely ambassador if and when Washington accords full diplomatic
relations. ``There have been too many Balkan wars fought over
Macedonia.''
</P>
<P>
Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou has ignored pleas from the
11 other members of the European Union to drop the embargo. Gligorov
maintains Macedonia is willing to make compromises, but says Greece
keeps creating new demands. President Clinton has appointed a special
envoy, Matthew Nimetz, to mediate the dispute, thus far without
breakthrough. And the EU has said it will take Greece to the European
Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
But some officials in Skopje fear a settlement of the problem will
come too late. ``We are very close to the edge,'' said Dimitar Belcev,
the Foreign Ministry's undersecretary for economic affairs.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, government officials here say the sanctions imposed by
the U.N. Security Council in 1992 against Serbian-dominated Yugoslavia
over its support for Serb forces in Bosnia are a bigger problem for
Macedonia than the Greek blockade.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions have largely cut Macedonia off from its
traditionally largest trading partner and have cut its land and river
links to Western Europe and the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
There are widespread violations of the sanctions via Macedonia,
U.S. and U.N. officials say. But all acknowledge that no country,
aside from Serbia, has suffered more from the sanctions, and that very
little of the promised economic compensation has been delivered to
Skopje.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions made Macedonia's outlet via the Greek port of
Salonika all the more important. ``The second and last railway link is
with Greece, our very dear neighbor to the south,'' said Belcev. With
the rail links through Serbia cut, ``the problem is we redirected
almost everything over Salonika.''
</P>
<P>
Oil and other goods are now being trucked through Bulgaria or
Albania, but transportation costs have risen 30 percent to 100
percent, according to the government.
</P>
<P>
Many raw materials no longer can be imported. Of grave concern to
the government, for example, is the loss of coke and phosphates needed
for zinc smelting. And because it is impossible to export products
such as steel plates and copper in bulk, foreign income is dwindling
and newly developed markets are being lost. ``The Italians are now
buying their steel pipes from Turkey,'' lamented Belcev.

 Foreign Companies Capitalize on Phone Sex for Americans (Hagerstown) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
HAGERSTOWN, Md.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Rebarick says he had no idea what or where
Sao Tome was until this winter, when a woman named Tanya gave him the
most expensive geography lesson of his life.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to her, the 33-year-old Hagerstown man now knows that Sao
Tome and Principe is a tiny island nation off the coast of West
Africa. He has also learned that one of its exports is sex talk -- 
which his roommate's girlfriend apparently imported liberally through
an international ``party line'' that bypassed the 900 call-blocking
service he signed up for the month before.
</P>
<P>
When the bills started coming in, she skipped town. Rebarick
doesn't know whether she was addicted to the sex talk lines or was
doing it for money. All he knows is she left him with about $3,500 in
phone bills -- more than $2,000 for calls to Sao Tome alone.
</P>
<P>
Rebarick is one of a growing number of victims of an increasingly
popular tactic among phone-sex merchants -- possibly in collaboration
with foreign phone companies.
</P>
<P>
By setting up overseas sex lines, they get around 900
call-blocking, a service used by many employers and parents. And when
the bills come in, as Rebarick found, the phone companies have one
response to customers: It's your phone, it's your responsibility.
</P>
<P>
For Rebarick, the burden of responsibility was too heavy. His phone
service has been cut off, and he says neither he nor his roommate has
enough money to have it restored.
</P>
<P>
Telephone company officials say they have heard relatively few
complaints about international sex lines so far, but they are worried
they could grow into a problem as serious as 900 lines were before
call-blocking and other protections were introduced. Rules adopted by
the FCC after Congress passed the 1991 Telephone Consumer Protection
Act require that charges be specified up front and that customers be
given a reasonable time to hang up without charge.
</P>
<P>
They also give customers broad rights to refuse payment for
unauthorized calls to 900 numbers -- a type of call where the local
phone company acts as the billing agent for the service provider. But
the international sex lines can evade those protections as well as
call-blocking.
</P>
<P>
The major long-distance companies are able to block all
international calls from a customer's number, but there's no
requirement that they offer the service. And while that solution might
work for a family with teen-agers, it could tie the hands of a company
with global interests.
</P>
<P>
Bob Spangler, deputy chief of enforcement at the Federal
Communications Commission, said there's little else U.S. long-distance
carriers can do. As common carriers, they are required to put calls
through without censorship and there is no way they can tell whether a
foreign number is a sex line until they start getting complaints. Even
then they have no authority to block calls to those lines.
</P>
<P>
Unlike U.S. 900 lines, callers do not pay a defined premium -- just
the basic cost of the long-distance call. So where are the profits
going?
</P>
<P>
Spangler points to the foreign carriers who collect money for
completing the call on their end -- in places such as Suriname, the
Netherlands Antilles, Portugal, the Dominican Republic and Sao Tome.
</P>
<P>
``We've been told that not only do they have an idea, but that
they're financing it,'' Spangler says. In many cases those phone
companies are government-owned, he notes, adding that the U.S.
government is trying to address the problem through diplomatic means.
He holds out little hope of a quick solution.
</P>
<P>
Sao Tome's phone company, which installed a new digital phone
system in January, is jointly owned by a Portuguese company and the
Sao Tome government.
</P>
<P>
AT T spokesman Dick Gundlach says his company is required under
international agreements to pay ``separation charges'' to the foreign
carriers that complete the call. He says each additional call going to
Sao Tome increases the monthly payment to Sao Tome's phone company at
the rate of 80 cents a minute.
</P>
<P>
So when a 30-minute prime-time call was placed from Rebarick's
phone to Sao Tome on the morning of Feb. 24, $24 of the $100 charge
went to the carrier in Sao Tome. On that day, when Rebarick and his
roommate say Tanya was the only person they knew to be in their home,
21 calls were placed to Sao Tome. Rebarick was billed $1,088.76, and
the Sao Tome phone company collected $278.40 that day.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Gundlach says AT T cannot legally deduct from its payments to the
Sao Tome carrier, regardless of whether Bell Atlantic or AT T ever
collects the money from Rebarick. AT T is negotiating with some
foreign companies and recently concluded an agreement with Codetel,
the Dominican Republic's phone carrier, allowing the American company
to deduct from its payments when a customer protests.
</P>
<P>
AT T security officials have noticed a growing number of
international sex line ads in such publications as High Society and
Hustler, Gundlach says. But potential callers need not buy a skin
magazine to get these numbers. Some daily newspapers accept classified
ads for international sex lines, alongside sexually oriented 900 lines
and 800 lines.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks after Moore's roommate Tanya left, she surfaced in
Minnesota to plead guilty to an earlier charge of phone credit card
fraud. She is now being sought for violating probation.

 RENO AT LARGE: Conservative Losers Still Winners 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Can it have been but 30 years since the forces of the far right in
the United States were led by such substantial figures as Barry
Goldwater and William F. Buckley?
</P>
<P>
Can it be 14 years since the legions of reaction adopted as their
messiah that somnolent and improbable former actor whose life in the
social orbit of Frank Sinatra was about as atypical of the
hearth-home-flag-prayer-abstinence-values wing of conservatism as a
divorced father of a dysfunctional family who ran off with a starlet
could be?
</P>
<P>
Taking stock of the ultra conservative movement, we now find the
amiable old gentleman of Bel-Air is about as involved and relevant as
an afternoon nap. And there is Barry Goldwater, obviously still well
short of his dotage, on television this week defending the right of
homosexuals to serve in the military and rather angrily denouncing the
``religious right.'' Bill Buckley, when he hasn't been coming out for
decriminalization of drugs, has been throwing a book publishing party
for that honored, unreconstructed and imperishable legend of the
American left, Murray Kempton.
</P>
<P>
And in the torrent of sometimes incoherent and invariably
lachrymose tributes to Richard Nixon, what finally stood out? It was
all the arguments that Nixon was, after all, a great, or at least
forgivable man for all the liberal things he did: cozying up to the
Chinese and the Russians, having a Keynesian domestic economic agenda,
supporting the arts, behaving charitably to blacks and Jews and all
the things that on the miles of yet unreleased National Archives tapes
we will some day discover Nixon actually despised with a curiously
perverse and almost touching envy.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, if you really think that liberalism has come to a craven
and miserable end in America, stop to realize that the
Goldwater-Buckley wing of what we used to think of as the pit of
darkness has been inherited by Oliver North, Pat Buchanan and, I
guess, Dan Quayle. First of all, can you imagine any of them maturing
in the mainstream fullness, tolerance and wisdom of old age, into a
Buckley or a Goldwater?
</P>
<P>
I can't.
</P>
<P>
Of course, victory is still theirs. It always is. That's the wonder
of it. They can make health care reform sound like the end of
capitalism as we know it, with the KGB roaming hospital corridors.
Hillary Clinton has become something of an ogre who makes grown
politicians scared to admit they're liberal. They can make a
single-payer, Canadian-style system sound like it came from Mars.
Fifty years ago, as immovable and pigheaded a conservative as Winston
Churchill described health care reform in Britain and state financing
of illness as merely a recognition of the fact that ``disease must be
attacked in the same way that a fire brigade will give assistance to
the humble cottage as readily as it will to the most important
mansion.''
</P>
<P>
That such a simple, inherently conservative and generous concept
could be reversed in our age to a squalid, well financed,
self-interested and mean-spirited movement as has now marshalled
itself against the sick people of America is to underscore the winds
of change. Either the insurance companies, doctors, hospitals, drug
companies and Mercedes drivers of this nation own it or the rest of us
do.

 Teamster President's Widow Investigated for Embezzlement (Cleveland) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
CLEVELAND
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Teamsters President Jackie Presser was one of the
nation's most controversial union chiefs when he died in 1988. At the
time, he was under indictment on racketeering charges, a case his
attorney had staved off by citing his role for more than a decade as a
secret informant for the FBI.
</P>
<P>
Now, a dispute over his surprisingly large $4.2 million estate has
surfaced in state court. It is Presser's ironic legacy: The case has
divided his family and involves potential criminality on the part of
his wife, Cynthia.
</P>
<P>
The court proceedings have arisen from the lavish lifestyle that
characterized the old-guard Teamster chieftain, and a widow who
refused to change that style after he succumbed to brain cancer.
Cynthia Presser -- his fifth wife -- has admitted misusing hundreds of
thousands of dollars from the estate and violating her duties as its
executor.
</P>
<P>
So blatant has been her conduct that a probate judge recently asked
the Cuyahoga County prosecutor's office to investigate Cynthia Presser
for possible embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
The case occurs at a time when frugality in the nation's largest
trade union is being stressed by a new Teamster president, Ron Carey,
who was elected on his pledge to reduce spending, cut costs and stamp
out corruption.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over the estate started with a civil proceeding filed
by John R. Climaco, Jackie Presser's former attorney and confidant,
and by Presser's two children from a previous marriage.
</P>
<P>
In a deposition filed in the case, Cynthia Presser said she has
spent $369,227 on clothes, decorating and furniture during her term as
executor of Presser's estate. Another $225,000 went to an ex-husband
and other relatives of hers.
</P>
<P>
``I know these look like exorbitant expenses,'' she said in her
sworn statement. ``But my life with my late husband provided me a life
like that, and I continued to live that life and that contributed to
these expenses.''
</P>
<P>
Although she was bequeathed a substantial sum by her late husband,
Cynthia Presser acknowledged she went beyond her inheritance by
dipping into funds that were set aside for her stepchildren, Gary and
Bari Presser.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
In her sworn statement, Cynthia Presser said her living expenses
have averaged $10,000 a month. In addition, she said she bought a
$10,000 diamond engagement ring for her son by a previous marriage to
give his fiancee and purchased a $629,000 lakefront home for herself
outside Cleveland. She told of buying a fur stole worth $3,000 in 1989
and spending $2,900 to have a larger closet built for her clothes.
</P>
<P>
She flew frequently to Arizona in the winter, she said. In
addition, she gave untold thousands of dollars -- in outright gifts or
loans -- to her parents, other relatives and friends, she testified.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Describing the lifestyle the Pressers enjoyed, a one-time close
associate of the late Teamster chief said in an interview: ``They
lived in a Washington condo paid for by the international union. It
was fully furnished and decorated in style, along with fine china,
silverware and crystal provided by the union. There were expensive
paintings on the walls and other artworks.
</P>
<P>
``She and Jackie got used to all-expense-paid vacations and
frequent business trips to California or Florida in the winter. The
union footed the bill for their accommodations at the finest hotels
and resorts, and they were picked up by limousine anywhere their
Teamsters' Gulfstream jet landed.''
</P>
<P>
How did Jackie Presser amass an estate of more than $4 million
while holding union posts his entire adult life?
</P>
<P>
Court records are silent on the matter, the ex-associate said.
``Jackie spent union funds lavishly but was frugal with his own money.
He had what amounted to an unlimited expense account and, therefore,
could save most of his union salary, which was considerable.''
</P>
<P>
In the years leading up to his death, Presser drew about $800,000
annually in pay. This included his $250,000 salary as general
president of the Teamsters, as well as pay from union posts he held.
</P>
<P>
Associates said he also made a profit of more than $1 million from
his investment in the 1970s in Cleveland's Front Row Theater. He
earned no fees from the 10 years he served as a secret informant for
the FBI, providing information on mobsters and Teamster rivals.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
The court records show that Cynthia Presser also is engaged in a
legal dispute with current union officials over the whereabouts and
ownership of some expensive furnishings that once adorned their
Washington condo. She is facing allegations that she shipped many of
these union-provided items to her home.
</P>
<P>
She agreed several months ago to pay $350,000 into Presser's
children's trust funds, as well as $200,000 in overdue legal fees. But
 -- unable to do so -- she filed for personal bankruptcy and was removed
as executor of the estate.
</P>
<P>
Now she is facing possible indictment in state court on grounds
that she embezzled more than $570,000.

 A Bittersweet Reunion in Gaza (Gaza City) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As they began to reunite from throughout
the Arab world with tears of joy and loss -- a catharsis that was a
quarter-century of occupation and separation in the making -- the Danaf
family of Gaza City had much to catch up on last week.
</P>
<P>
Shawky Danaf had to break the worst of it to his half-brother,
Arafat, who arrived in an Iraqi paratrooper's uniform along with
hundreds of other Palestinian police officers in newly autonomous
Jericho. After four years of war and isolation with the Palestine
Liberation Army brigade based in Baghdad, the news was hard for Arafat
to bear.
</P>
<P>
Their brother Mohammad was dead, Shawky told him by phone in a
voice choked with pain. He had been shot and killed by Israel's
occupation army three months short of this greatly anticipated reunion
 -- the coming together of a family long divided, like so many in the
occupied lands. Just before his death, Mohammad had spoken of this
reunion as a dream more distant only than the dream of living together
with his exiled father and four half-brothers in a liberated
Palestinian land.
</P>
<P>
By the end of their conversation, both Shawky and Arafat were in
tears.
</P>
<P>
The Danafs' saga speaks volumes about the events unfolding at
ground zero of the Middle East conflict, as Israel and the Palestine
Liberation Organization finally have begun the first concrete steps
toward peace.
</P>
<P>
They are a family of simple poverty among hundreds of thousands of
Palestinian refugees who are beginning the long process of erasing the
distance and pain of exile and occupation. And like the peace process
itself, the Danaf reunion is far from complete. In fact, it has just
begun.
</P>
<P>
The family's father, a former Palestinian fighter named Hassan,
fled to Gaza with his first wife from their Arab village in Southern
Israel in 1948, when the Israeli state was carved out of British-ruled
Palestine. Nineteen years later, he fled again after the Arabs lost
the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. He left his wife, three sons and two
daughters in Gaza, bounced from Arab land to Arab land and finally
settled with a second wife in Egypt, where he fathered two sons and
two daughters.
</P>
<P>
As the surviving half-brothers -- two in Gaza and two in the
Palestinian brigades destined to serve the autonomous zones -- 
anticipate their imminent reunion, it is Arafat and the slain Mohammad
who best symbolize both the decades of Israeli occupation and the
peace-building task now at hand.
</P>
<P>
The Danafs' complex story was gleaned in more than a dozen visits
to their home and to a Gaza City cafe that Mohammad had opened last
year while unemployed -- to keep from going mad, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is the story of the splintered and often confusing relationships
that typify Gazan families, of lifetimes of desperation and fading
hope now turned to bittersweet joy. And it is a story that
demonstrates the human impact of the beginning of both the end of
Israel's 27 years of occupation in the former Palestine and of the
effort still needed to restore enough hope to build Gaza and Jericho
into the core of a future Palestinian land.
</P>
<P>
Shawky, 32, and Arafat, 19, spoke for the first time in many years
when Shawky delivered the news of Mohammad's death in the phone call
to Arafat's military post. Gaza and Jericho, the two autonomous
Palestinian zones, are still divided by dozens of miles of Israeli
territory. A promised route for Palestinian safe passage is still
weeks -- or months -- away.
</P>
<P>
Not even Arafat's mother, Rida Wahbeh Abdul-Rasoul, who traveled
from Cairo to Gaza two weeks ago to begin the reunion, can see him
yet. The Egyptian second wife of Hassan came to Gaza not only to meet
the other half of her husband's family but also to see her own sons
Arafat and Sabar, for the first time in years.
</P>
<P>
Then last week, on the day Palestinian extremists gunned down two
Israeli soldiers near the Gaza border, Israel sealed off Gaza for at
least nine days, a further obstacle to the reunion.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad and Shawky's mother -- Halima Abu Obeid -- had little time
last week for the problems of her husband's second wife. After all,
Hassan had abandoned her when Mohammad, Shawky and the eldest brother,
Ibrahim, 36, were just infants, fleeing into exile.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Halima said, Rida was living with her in Gaza now.
Arafat and Halima's other stepson, Sabar, 25, are almost home after
serving in exiled Palestinian brigades in Iraq and Libya both during
and after the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Sabar, due to arrive in Gaza any day with his delayed brigade from
Libya, was ``a carbon copy'' of Mohammad, Halima said.
</P>
<P>
``When my husband called this morning from Cairo, he asked how I
was feeling now with the boys coming home,'' she recalled. ``With him,
I can still speak freely. I said, `I still feel a great sadness. My
hand is not complete. Still a big finger is missing. Our son Mohammad
is gone. We have lost him. And nothing can bring him back.' ''
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Last December, Mohammad knew his half-brothers, Arafat and Sabar,
were among the Palestinian fighters who would return to a homeland
they never knew. He learned that news from his father, in the same way
many Gazans kept up with relatives in Egypt after occupation. They
would travel to the divided city of Rafah that straddles the Egyptian
border in Gaza's extreme south and, at prearranged meetings, shout to
each other through barbed wire across 30 yards.
</P>
<P>
Even at the time, Mohammad stressed the significance of this
promised reunion -- a small but powerful step in the reuniting of more
than 2 million Palestinian relatives still separated by occupation and
exile. It was, he said then, almost too good to be true.
</P>
<P>
``Even if we have self-government in only one small piece of Gaza,
it will be better for us, of course. But I fear for the future,'' he
explained. ``I'd love to see the Palestine police force take control
of this region, but I doubt it will happen.''
</P>
<P>
It did happen, but he didn't see it.
</P>
<P>
Within weeks of its opening, Mohammad's cafe was trashed. It
happened during an armed clash with another Palestinian family over
ownership of the land. Desperate, Mohammad illegally crossed into
Israel and took back his old construction job. After two months,
Israeli authorities caught him. He was deported.
</P>
<P>
``Mohammad came home about midnight on Feb. 24,'' Shawky recalled.
``He was angry and exhausted. When he woke up about noon the next day
and heard what had happened that morning, something just snapped in
him. He left the house in a fury. The next time we saw him, he was
dead.''
</P>
<P>
That was the day in February when a Jewish settler opened fire
inside a Hebron mosque, killing about 30 Palestinian worshipers and
nearly destroying the autonomy plan for Gaza and Jericho. The killings
touched off demonstrations and riots throughout the occupied lands.
Mohammad joined one of them, outside the Israeli military camp near
his home. He was shot in the right side of his chest. He died in the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
As he sat outside the remains of the cafe last week, Shawky was in
tears.
</P>
<P>
``Of course we will be happy when we finally see our two (half)
brothers. But we are still in mourning for Mohammad, so there will be
no celebration,'' he said. ``After a time, I will try to reopen this
cafe. That was Mohammad's dream, and so now it is mine. But you must
understand, we already have paid the full price of this peace.''

 Human Rights In China 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The following editorial appeared in Wednesday's Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
China's respect for human rights -- or China's lack of it -- will
affect the lives of incalculable numbers of people over the coming
decades. China has not only a huge population of its own, but great
influence on other poor countries as it successfully and rapidly
becomes richer.
</P>
<P>
That's why President Clinton needs to keep pressing the Chinese
government on human rights. And that's why he needs a better
instrument than the threat to lift MFN -- most-favored-nation treatment
 -- and cut off Chinese exports to the United States.
</P>
<P>
It is important not to misunderstand the current scale of Chinese
abuse of political and religious freedom, or to allow the Chinese
government to argue that Americans are only trying to impose their own
legal practices on another culture.
</P>
<P>
Many of the worst trespasses, like the frequent resort to torture
by the police, are in violation of Chinese law. Large and persuasive
compilations of these cases have been published by such reputable
organizations as Amnesty International USA, Asia Watch and the Puebla
Institute.
</P>
<P>
The issue is how to bring the Chinese government into conformity
with its own laws, and with the principles accepted by most other
countries, rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
One danger in lifting MFN is that it would sharply diminish China's
contacts with this country. Ideas follow the trade routes, and
increased trade means increased openness to other changes as well.
</P>
<P>
Lifting MFN would also impede the development of a market economy
in China, and the emergence of a commercial middle class -- two forces
that are already undercutting the centralized Communist regime.
</P>
<P>
The United States has more effective ways to lean on China. A
warmer policy toward Taiwan and more public attention to the
repression in Tibet would remind China's rulers that there are real
penalties attached to violation of the world's standards -- penalties
that would not injure the people in China who are pushing their
country in the direction in which most Americans want to see it move.
</P>
<P>
Repeatedly calling a government to account for its human-rights
record and engaging it in a dialogue, privately and publicly, is a
diplomatic tactic that has had significant successes in many places
over the years.
</P>
<P>
There is hardly any exercise in international politics more
difficult than bringing a rising power peacefully into the world
system. China is a great power, with nuclear weapons and the world's
third-largest national economy. But it has not yet acknowledged the
responsibilities that its position carries.
</P>
<P>
Clinton needs a strategy not to shut China out, but to draw it more
deeply into the fabric of international agreements and organizations
that set governments' standards for dealing decently both with each
other and with their own people.
</P>
<P>
The welfare of Asia, and of the United States as a Pacific power,
will depend on his success.

words, by Shari Roan (Times) (l).

 WORDS: Permit No Usage Breach to Mar A Perfect Speech 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even under elegant academic robes, you can often spot serious
(breeches, breaches) of usage rules. Which words should this
commencement speaker choose in order to avoid mistakes?
</P>
<P>
``Distinguished faculty, (reverend, reverent) clergy, honored
graduates:
</P>
<P>
``I'm delighted to be standing at this (lectern, podium) this
morning, participating in this (ceremonial, ceremonious) ritual. As I
look out over the (luxurious, luxuriant) grass and trees of your
campus, I think I'll go golfing. So that's my speech. Thank you.''
(boos, wild applause.)
</P>
<P>
Answers:
</P>
<P>
1) Reverend. Whether they're priests, rabbis, ministers or monks,
they're all ``reverend'' (deserving reverence) on graduation day.
Calling them ``reverent,'' would mean that they themselves are filled
with reverence, which they probably are. But on this occasion, they're
the ones being revered.
</P>
<P>
2) Lectern. A lectern is a stand that supports a speaker's notes or
books. A podium is the elevated platform on which a speaker stands.
While, through common use (it gets scuffed a lot), ``podium'' has
acquired a secondary meaning of ``lectern,'' elevated grammarians
regard such usage as base.
</P>
<P>
3) Ceremonial. As long as we're standing on a podium, let's stand
on ceremony. ``Ceremonial'' refers to anything associated with a
ceremony, as in ``ceremonial offering.'' ``Ceremonious,'' which almost
always refers to people or behavior, means ``unusually formal or
meticulous in manner,'' and bears a negative connotation of being a
fussy and ritualistic.
</P>
<P>
4) Luxuriant. Strictly, ``luxuriant'' means lush or abundant (``a
luxuriant beard''), while ``luxurious'' means full of luxury or
sumptuous (``a luxurious penthouse'').
</P>
<P>
It's worth noting that respectable writers have often luxuriated in
the pleasure of using these words interchangeably. Theodore Dreiser
wrote of ``luxuriant restaurants,'' for instance, while Henry David
Thoreau described ``luxurious misty timber,'' which is where our
erstwhile graduation speaker probably hit his first tee shot.
</P>
<P>
5) Wild applause.

 Retailers, Publishers Gear Up for Booksellers' Convention 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's too costly, too important, too tiring, too silly, too long or
too short. It's the American Booksellers Association's annual
convention and trade exhibit, scheduled this weekend in Los Angeles.
Though retailers and publishers differ on the value of spending each
Memorial Day weekend talking up fall titles, and dashing from
luncheons to seminars to nightly parties, the expected attendance
shows that ``The ABA'' remains a seasonal rite that book-industry
players are loath to ignore.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 1,600 publishers and other exhibitors will display
their products in the Los Angeles Convention Center, covering 322,000
square feet, or 20 percent more space than was reserved by companies
at last year's show in Miami Beach. And 30,000 people are expected to
pass through, which would make this the second-best-attended
convention since the one held in 1991 in New York City.
</P>
<P>
The drill hasn't changed: The publishers plan to romance the
booksellers and try to whip up interest in new goods, and the
booksellers will revel in the attention as they consider the size of
their orders.
</P>
<P>
``The big publishing houses, with their sales reps around the
country, are so self-assured that they're there for the exercise,''
said Bernie Rath, executive director of the American Booksellers
Association, whose 4,500 members consist mainly of independently owned
businesses. ``But the medium- and smaller-sized publishers that have
no sales force on the road rely on the convention to meet the buyer.''
</P>
<P>
Michelle Sidrane, president of the Crown Publishing Group, one of
the major-league publishing companies, said she hopes to detour
booksellers off the busy convention floor to quieter meeting rooms in
order to present special promotions involving fall books. Crown's list
includes titles by Larry King, John Denver, Dave Barry and Martha
Stewart. In addition to these brand names, Sidrane said, the publisher
hopes to kindle enthusiasm for Judith Rossner's ``Olivia'' and two
other novels whose film rights have already been bought by Hollywood -- 
Nina Vida's ``Goodbye, Saigon'' and Mark Olshaker's ``The Edge.'' On
the festive side, Crown will present Barry in a night of standup
comedy at The Improv and Audrey Meadows at a party designed to
showcase her fall memoir, ``Love, Alice: My Life as a Honeymooner.''
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Suppliers of CD-ROMs and other electronic media will occupy about
10,000 square feet at the convention center -- vivid evidence that
these companies want bookstores to offer their products along with the
latest John Grisham thriller.
</P>
<P>
``We very much believe that the most convenient site for the
perusal of electronic media is the bookstore,'' said Morton E. David,
chairman of Franklin Electronic Publishers Inc., an exhibitor based in
Mount Holly, N.J. ``Booksellers, by and large, if they take a pass on
offering some kind of electronic media, are going to regret it four or
five years down the road.''
</P>
<P>
Franklin, which employs 200 people and posted $66 million in sales
last year, will be showing off various electronic books, including its
$99 Spanish Master, a pocket-sized bilingual dictionary that can speak
250,000 words in English and Spanish by using voice-synthesized
technology.

While this weekend's ABA offers no star-powered extravaganza like
the Putnam Publishing Group's blast last year for Ann-Margret (``My
Story'') or Alfred A. Knopf's lavish do for Oprah Winfrey (who ended
up scuttling the autobiography she planned to deliver), New York
publishers have planned an array of parties to promote their books.
Scribners has arranged a tea for Barbara Bush, whose autobiography
will be published in September; W.W. Norton Co. will celebrate the
release of Walter Mosley's new ``Black Betty,'' another of his Easy
Rawlins capers set in Los Angeles, with soul sounds at the Biltmore
Hotel; Warner Books' invitation to the St. James Club urges folks ``to
Get Down with Your Bad Self and Berry Gordy,'' the mainstay of Motown
Records, whose autobiography, ``To Be Loved,'' is scheduled for
October.
</P>
<P>
The list of RSVPs to Buzz's ABA party at House of Blues shows that
the reach of the upstart L.A. magazine extends to many top executives
in New York publishing. This especially pleases Eden Collinsworth, a
former New York book publisher who is now president and chief
executive officer of Buzz.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the home of television and Hollywood is a suitable
venue for purveyors of the printed word, Collinsworth said, ``I
certainly brought to L.A. a condescending, East Coast attitude toward
the city. But in the five years I've been here, it's certainly been
made clear to me that this is a far more confident and cosmopolitan
area than many back east assume.''

 Chain-saw Artist Isn't Type to Follow the Flock 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Damien Hirst is London's leading chain-saw artist. He
hacks dead livestock in half.
</P>
<P>
He split-cut a cow and a calf lengthwise and displayed them in
huge, sealed cases of formaldehyde at the 1993 Venice Biennale, like
... well ... like sides of beef in a butcher shop. The Venice Biennale
is, of course, one of the world's most prestigious art events.
</P>
<P>
He sawed a pig's head in half for this month's British edition of
Esquire. The artist is shown with his chain saw. We see the chain saw
in action. Close-up photos of the halves of the split pig's head are
printed as the magazine's centerfold, inside-out, as it were, very red
against a flesh-toned background. No airbrush has edited out offensive
parts to protect the squeamish as the old Playboy used to do.
</P>
<P>
He's routinely called the ``enfant terrible'' of the British art
world, the artist most talked about, doing the most striking work.
He's 28 and from Leeds, the old Yorkshire city, where he saw his first
preserved specimens in a mortuary when he was a schoolboy.
</P>
<P>
``I was just really kind of fascinated by them,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
He first floated into national notoriety two years ago with a
toothy, 14-foot tiger shark, immersed in its own preservative tank of
formaldehyde. He called the piece ``The Physical Impossibility of
Death in the Mind of Someone Living.'' He likes an expressive title.
The shark appeared at the very trendy Saatchi Gallery and launched him
into instant tabloid fame. His shark has been called the most
caricatured work of art since Whistler's Mother.
</P>
<P>
His latest animal act is a lamb, all woolly and cuddly-looking,
floating in a white-framed tank of faintly greenish-tinted
formaldehyde. It's in a show that opened this month at the Serpentine
Gallery.
</P>
<P>
Hirst is curator, and he has chosen 15 artists who share his
interests: ``fear, loss, hope, death, fantasy,'' the press release
says.
</P>
<P>
The work he's chosen includes eerie and exquisite photos, by
Hiroshi Sugimoto, of the serial killers in Madame Tussaud's waxworks;
a flayed, anatomical figure called Virgin Mary, sculpted in wax by
Kiki Smith; an orange, fiberglass cast of Rodin's Balzac by Michael
Joaquin Grey, hung upside-down from the ceiling; a bicycle packed with
plastics and bags by Andreas Slominksi, leaning against the gallery
wall as if abandoned by a homeless pilgrim.
</P>
<P>
The show is called ``Some Ran Away ... Some Went Mad.''
</P>
<P>
Hirst calls his preserved lamb ``Away From the Flock.''
</P>
<P>
``It's just like a shepherd's thing,'' he says at the opening. He's
leaning against a doorjamb, a polite, easygoing, round-faced guy in a
baseball hat, white T-shirt, jacket and jeans.
</P>
<P>
``There's an allegory that has to do with people and sheep,'' he
says. ``It's like: `You're just like sheep, you do what everyone else
does.' I do what I do, and it's different.
</P>
<P>
``So you're away from the flock in that way. But then I kind of see
it so tragic and dead and kind of cute, and looking out at the green
grass, which I quite think is good.''
</P>
<P>
The lamb gazes out of its formaldehyde tank onto the greensward of
Kensington Gardens. The galley is by the Serpentine, the lake that
winds between Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park.
</P>
<P>
Not everybody likes it, he says. Londoners are more used to lamb on
a menu than in a museum, eating dead meat rather than looking at it.
``I've heard a lot of people say it's terrible,'' he says. `` `Why do
you do that to a lamb? Oh my God.' ''
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
One free-lance art critic went from words to action, pouring ink
into the tank of formaldehyde one recent evening.
</P>
<P>
``It went completely black,'' a gallery visitor told Dalya Alberge
of The Independent. ``You could see the sheep disappear. There were a
lot of visitors there. Everyone was bewildered and highly amused.
People were laughing.''
</P>
<P>
Hirst, who already had sold the piece for $37,500, spent the night
draining and rinsing the animal in an attempt to wash out the ink. He
had no immediate comment. He has said his work ``has just got to get
people involved. The worst thing is if someone just walks in and out
without seeing anything.''
</P>
<P>
He thinks that in a way he's immortalized his lamb.
</P>
<P>
``You know it was already dead when I found it,'' he says. ``I
found it in a knacker's yard, where animals go when they die. I
resurrected it into this situation. It would have been dog food. So I
kind of saved it from that, in a way. And I quite like that. It's
tragic, but cute.''
</P>
<P>
And despite an undeniable macabre element to his work, he's not
interested in similarly preserving a human being.
</P>
<P>
``Not really,'' he says. ``I don't think you get metaphor with
people. It's too direct. You get metaphor with animals, but you don't
with people.''
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
His work will last, he thinks.
</P>
<P>
``I've seen pieces that are 200 years old,'' he says. ``As long as
they don't get out of the liquid, they'll stay like that.'' Which is a
good thing, because from here, the show goes to Finland, Germany and
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
The Serpentine show, incidentally, is sponsored by Haagen-Dazs. The
company passed out chocolate-covered ice cream on a stick.

 Guidelines Should Help Decide Treatment for Ear Infections 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Artinian's ear infections began within weeks of his birth.
Every few weeks, says his mother, Chris, the baby would fret and fuss
with the pain of a new infection.
</P>
<P>
His pediatrician tried antibiotics for months. The milder ones did
nothing and infections even flared up when Michael was taking the
strongest antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
Finally, when Michael was 8 months old, the doctor suggested a
surgical procedure called a tympanostomy -- in which ear tubes are
inserted to drain fluid from the middle ear and clear up infection.
The Artinians agreed.
</P>
<P>
Parents often wonder if they are doing the right thing by choosing
surgery to heal chronic ear infections, which generally occur as a
result of a cold, sore throat or other respiratory infection. Their
doubts stem from disagreements in the medical community about whether
the procedure is overdone.
</P>
<P>
``It's never easy to put your child through surgery,'' says
Artinian. ``But, as a parent, you have to get hooked up with the right
doctor -- a doctor you are in sync with.''
</P>
<P>
But now parents may have more to rely on than just their doctors.
</P>
<P>
An article in last month's Journal of the American Medical
Association suggested a set of guidelines for tympanostomy (while
noting that as many as one-fourth of all ear-tube surgeries now
performed may be unnecessary).
</P>
<P>
And, this summer, the federal Agency for Health Care Policy and
Research will release guidelines for doctors and parents on the
treatment of childhood middle ear infection, or otitis media.
</P>
<P>
Otitis media is the most common reason for doctor visits in
children under 6, accounting for about 30 million visits a year. Yet
there are no clear-cut guidelines to help doctors and parents know
which of several treatment options -- antibiotics, surgery to insert
ear tubes or doing nothing -- work best and with the least risk to the
child.
</P>
<P>
``The reason we suggest certain disorders for the guidelines is
that there is substantial variation in care,'' says Rose Findley, an
agency spokeswoman. ``One doctor treats it one way and across town
there is a completely different type of treatment pattern. There isn't
much consensus. And, (the nation) is spending a lot of money on it,
but we don't know what the best or most appropriate treatment might
be.''
</P>
<P>
The guidelines are highly anticipated, not only because of the
magnitude of the problem but because of the contentiousness that has
arisen among doctors on how to treat otitis media.
</P>
<P>
The experts who contributed to the new federal report, joked one
doctor, ``will then enter the government's Witness Protection
Program.''
</P>
<P>
``I think there is a fair amount of data, but I think it's
confusing and difficult to synthesize,'' says Dr. Lawrence C.
Kleinman, a Harvard physician and author of the JAMA report. In that
study, a panel of doctors reviewed research on tympanostomies to
develop criteria on when the surgery should be considered.
</P>
<P>
Using the panel's criteria, the study found that of the 670,000
tympanostomies performed each year, 41 percent were appropriate, 32
percent had equivocal indications and 27 percent were found to be
inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
An appropriate reason to choose surgery, the article states, would
be for a child who has fluid trapped in the middle ear behind the
eardrum (called otitis media with effusion) that does not clear up
despite treatment with antibiotics. The tiny tube inserted in the
eardrum during surgery allows the fluid to drain and restores a
child's hearing, which can be muffled when fluid has collected. The
tubes remain in the ear for several months to a year and fall out on
their own.
</P>
<P>
Surgery is considered inappropriate, for example, if a child had
fewer than four ear infections a year or had not been treated
sufficiently with antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
But, Kleinman says, it is impossible to predict how any individual
child will fare.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
The guidelines might divert surgeries that take place out of
frustration, Kleinman adds. Recurrent ear infections can cause misery
for families, causing the child a lot of discomfort and parents many
sleepless nights. Moreover, doctors and parents worry about the small
chance that ear infections will cause hearing loss and speech delay.
</P>
<P>
``Sometimes the level of frustration with ear infections can lead
to hasty actions that are not well considered,'' Kleinman says.
</P>
<P>
No guidelines should revoke the right of doctors and parents to
individualize their decisions, says Dr. David Bergman, a Stanford
University physician who worked on the federal guidelines.
</P>
<P>
``The bottom line, to me, is that you have to take each case
individually and not use expert consensus as a way of driving your
decision one way or another,'' he says.

 ROSENBERG ON TV: TV's Drama About Blacks Is All Behind the Scenes 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's an old story -- television's ultimate blacklisting or
brownlisting.
</P>
<P>
Black sitcoms appear indelibly affixed to prime time, yet getting a
family drama about blacks, or Asian-Americans or Latinos, on the air
remains the hardest of hard sells.
</P>
<P>
Take the case of current prime-time ratings champ CBS. It has vowed
to widen its audience beyond Norman Rockwell folk to include more of
the nation's urban young, but in picking new series to open the
1994-95 season, the network omitted the worthy ``Under One Roof,'' a
weekly drama that was developed by its own production arm and may lack
only one prerequisite for prime time.
</P>
<P>
Whiteness.
</P>
<P>
``We haven't passed on it,'' said CBS spokeswoman Susan Tick.
</P>
<P>
``I'm very pessimistic,'' said executive producer Thomas Carter
(``Equal Justice'').
</P>
<P>
Television's minstrels appear in multiple shades, and Fox's new
fall lineup includes an action show, ``M.A.N.T.I.S.,'' whose hero is
black. When it comes to drama, however, TV seeks to seduce a rainbow
of Americans with mostly a single color. Implicit here is that most
programmers are ethnocentric, believing that non-whites will be
riveted to whites in non-comedic situations, but not vice versa.
</P>
<P>
Black families have been nearly invisible in family drama, a
situation ``Under One Roof'' could help remedy. Its protagonists are
the Langstons, a middle-of-the-middle-class black family living in
Seattle. No drugs, no violence, no gangs, not even an absentee father.
No major dysfunction, just a highly appealing family.
</P>
<P>
Although not faultless, the pilot for ``Under One Roof'' ripples
with more promise than 90 percent of what presently passes for drama
in prime time. Its humor is unforced, its conflicts between
generations are genuine, and its interesting, endearing characters
relate in ways that likely would earn them the empathy of real-life
families.
</P>
<P>
Plus, the cast is first-rate. Joe Morton is Ron Langston, a former
career military man trying his hand at business. Vanessa Bell Calloway
is his wife, Maggie, who resumed school to get a nursing degree. James
Earl Jones is Ron's father, Neb, a cop who lives downstairs with a
street youth he and his late wife took in. Joe and Maggie have two
kids of their own, and Ron's younger sister is also part of this
likable extended brood.
</P>
<P>
Written by Martha Williamson, Michael Henry Brown and Paul Aaron
(the latter two wrote HBO's ``Laurel Avenue''), the pilot's teleplay
has an edge while also projecting the kind of warmth and even teary
poignancy that usually has network programmers bawling all the way to
the bank. If ever a contemporary black family drama was going to make
the schedule in the '90s, you'd think this would be it.
</P>
<P>
``Under One Roof'' is not only absent from the fall lineup,
however, it also received no backup order from CBS, said Carter,
making it questionable even for mid-season emergence.
</P>
<P>
But CBS has not written all of its 1994-'95 backup orders, and
``Under One Roof'' could still get one, spokeswoman Tick said. ``It's
still in play here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
``I think their first concern is about the characters being
black,'' said Carter, who directed the pilot. ``I think they're also
concerned that this is a very honest show. They're a slave to
gimmicks. We would have had a better chance to get it on the air if we
had a tragedy that brings the family together.''
</P>
<P>
Carter said it was CBS Entertainment President Peter Tortorici who
(when still the division's No. 2 executive) approached him about doing
a ``black show -- he would have accepted a comedy -- with a strong male
figure'' for CBS Productions. Carter said when ``Under One Roof'' was
screened for CBS executives in Los Angeles, ``they loved it and
thought the show was a slam dunk.'' But when the pilot was viewed by
network management in New York, he said, the attitude changed and
``everything went askew.''
</P>
<P>
Equally askew is an industry that rarely finds room for blacks who
live in the real world and don't speak the language of one-liners.

FOOD FOR THOUGHT: ``Mmmm, I love garlic,'' Katie Couric said last
Wednesday morning, starting a cooking segment for NBC's traveling
``Today'' program at a Boston seafood restaurant.
</P>
<P>
For Couric and ``Today,'' the grotesquely sadistic act that
followed was just a big laugher. Inadvertently, though, they provided
an educational service by erasing the abstraction and graphically
showing the process by which some of the animals we eat arrive on our
plate.
</P>
<P>
The fare was lobster.
</P>
<P>
No, not a lobster boiled alive in a pot of water, but something
even yummier and rather more exotic. After heating the garlic in a pan
and adding some crushed red pepper, the chef picked up the entree -- a
live lobster -- and twisted off its claws as it writhed. A wincing
Couric quickly turned away. ``I can't look. Hurry!''
</P>
<P>
But fine cuisine can't be hurried. The chef then selected a large
knife and, as Couric cringed, sliced the still-moving lobster in half.
``Oh, what a way to go,'' Couric said fliply.
</P>
<P>
Then the chef took the upper half of the still-moving lobster and
began sauteing it in the pan. ``Oh, it's still moving,'' Couric said,
then wittily joked: ``Can't you give him sleeping pills or something
before you cut him up?''
</P>
<P>
After the mirth subsided, it was time to add wine and tomato sauce
in preparation for cooking the lobster for 10 to 12 minutes. Couric:
``And we'll be back in a moment to hear some music from the Boston
Pops.''
</P>
<P>
Bon appetit.

THE WORD: Although he does some goofy things from time to time,
Phil Donahue at least can be counted on, usually, to be an effective
devil's advocate. On Monday's episode of ``Donahue,'' though, he was
overwhelmed and rendered inept by controversial Nation of Islam
lecturer Khalid Abdul Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
Muhammad, a disciple and suspended aide of National of Islam leader
Louis Farrakhan, was the hour's only guest. The invective-spewing
verbal barrage by him and his boisterous followers, who were packed
into the front of the studio, targeted all whites in general, all Jews
in particular. Donahue and a few doddering audience members made some
feeble attempts at rebuttal, but were no match for the relentless
assault, and Donahue, in particular, ultimately appeared to give up.
</P>
<P>
Thus, he did not challenge repeated broad claims that Muhammad's
assertions about historical Jewish oppression of blacks were endorsed
by ``Jewish scholars.'' Rushing through the audience with his mike, he
did not challenge a man who insisted that the Bible calls Jews ``the
synagogue of Satan.'' He did not quiz a man who urged Allah to
``remove all white folks from the planet Earth.''
</P>
<P>
Can you imagine Donahue not asking a loony white guy what he meant
by urging God to erase all blacks? Or Donahue letting Ku Klux Klan
members slander blacks virtually at will? It wouldn't happen.

 Is Panic Attack a Matter of False Alarm Over Fear? 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Spontaneous panic attacks, once thought to be the physical
manifestation of inner angst, may instead be triggered by a glitch in
the body's respiratory system, according to a new study.
</P>
<P>
``It is not anxiety or fear at all,'' said Dr. Donald Klein,
professor of psychiatry at Columbia University College of Physicians
and Surgeons. ``Panic attacks result from a physiological
abnormality'' in which the body's natural suffocation alarm is falsely
tripped.
</P>
<P>
That alarm, Klein said, is located in the carotid body, an area in
the neck that acts like a sensor to measure the amount of oxygen and
carbon dioxide in the blood. It normally goes off, he explained, only
when levels of the two chemicals are dramatically altered -- for
instance, when you're being smothered. However, Klein said that people
who tend to suffer panic attacks appear for an as-yet unknown reason
to be more sensitive than others to even a tiny fluctuation in the
amount of carbon dioxide in their bodies.
</P>
<P>
This, he theorizes, can prompt the carotid to send a false signal
to the brain, causing it to shut down the respiratory system. And the
shutdown, in turn, prompts classic ``panic attack'' symptoms:
shortness of breath or smothering sensations; dizziness, unsteadiness,
or faintness; an accelerated heart rate or palpitations; trembling;
hot or cold flashes; and nausea.
</P>
<P>
Klein's theory, which is backed by intriguing data gathered by him
and his colleagues at the New York State Psychiatric Institute, could
alter the concept of these frightening attacks, leading to novel
treatments that prompt a drop in carbon dioxide in the body, experts
say. This might include progesterone, a natural hormone, and Diamox, a
drug used for glaucoma.
</P>
<P>
The findings are to be reported this week during the American
Psychiatric Association's annual meeting in Philadelphia. About 1.2
million Americans experience spontaneous panic attacks, which experts
previously thought were triggered by inner fears or, as Sigmund Freud
explained it, threatening impulses. But Klein, boldly marking new
territory in the disease, says, ``That's a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
He said that since the 1950s he has listened to patient after
patient complain of panic attacks that left them gasping for breath,
and feeling that they were going to die. ``It was an overwhelming
experience of shortness of breath verging on smothering,'' the
psychiatrist said.
</P>
<P>
Those descriptions caused him to suspect that panic patients were
suffering a respiratory dysfunction, rather than a psychological one.
If the theory holds up, experts say, it could help explain why these
attacks don't seem to occur any more frequently during frightening and
stressful times as when they are relaxed, even sleeping.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Thomas Uhde, chairman of psychiatry and behavioral
neurosciences at Wayne State University and an expert on panic
disorders, believes Klein is ``on to something,'' adding, ``We will be
testing his ideas.''
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Klein said he and his colleagues are in the midst of
gathering more scientific proof to back these ideas. The theory was
built on recent studies, also carried out at Columbia, showing that
lactate and carbon dioxide can trigger a panic attack in people prone
to the condition, and does nothing to others without such attacks.
</P>
<P>
Lactate is a substance that is normally produced in the body from
pyruvate, which allows the body to continue to oxidize glucose even
when it's running low on oxygen. Humans don't normally breathe in
carbon dioxide, but it is a gas found in tiny amounts in the lungs -- 
about 5 percent. Interestingly, more than half of panic patients say
they frequently hyperventilate, which helps them to avoid a panic
attack, Klein said, by blowing off carbon dioxide. Further evidence
that the suffocation alarm may be tripped comes from a higher than
normal percent of people with panic attacks among those with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. They have obvious
respiratory difficulties. Klein says that his colleagues have also
done some work to suggest that women in childbirth almost never
experience an attack. During labor, when women often hyperventilate,
carbon dioxide is at its lowest level, Klein said.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
However, the most interesting evidence of the existence of a
``suffocation alarm'' comes from a group of children with congenital
central hypoventilation syndrome, referred to as Ondine's Curse.
</P>
<P>
These children have a rare disease that affects one in 100,000
people. It is named after the mythological water nymph whose father
turned her lover's every minute, involuntary movement into a voluntary
act.
</P>
<P>
The Ondine children can't breathe when asleep, and thus many die
soon after birth. The few survivors -- the oldest ones are in their
teens -- have been kept alive through radio-frequency coils implanted
in their phrenic nerves that stimulate contraction of the diaphragm
every five seconds during sleep. These children, according to studies
conducted by Klein and Dr. Debra Weese-Mayer of Rush Presbyterian-St.
Lukes Medical Center in Chicago, lack a suffocation alarm reflex.
</P>
<P>
Their studies have shown that these children can be bathed in
carbon dioxide and it does not stimulate respiration. They have no
feeling of suffocation -- even when they are running low on oxygen and
turning blue. What's more, these children rarely express fear or
anxiety over their dreadful and life-threatening illness, counter to
studies that have shown a high degree of anxiety among children with
chronic medical conditions.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Klein also looked at situations where people were actually
suffocating, finding it in studies of people attempting to commit
suicide using exhaust fumes in their garage. Carbon monoxide, the gas
that is put out in car exhaust fumes, binds hemoglobin and prevents it
from carrying oxygen throughout the body. Ironically, it is a painless
way to die, Klein explains, because carbon monoxide inhibits activity
in the carotid, the possible seat of the body's suffocation center.
Klein suspects that carbon monoxide could be acting as an anti-panic
agent.
</P>
<P>
This idea will be tested soon at the psychiatric institute. Klein
and his colleagues will be collecting panic patients for a study using
carbon dioxide, which has been shown to trigger these attacks in these
people, and small amounts of carbon monoxide. If carbon monoxide is an
anti-panic substance, as Klein suspects, it should block the attack.
</P>
<P>
``That carbon monoxide might actually block panic would be really
peculiar,'' said Klein, who turns his back on conventional theories
because they liken panic attacks to the utmost in fear. ``Fear almost
never produces an intense smothering response,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
``We are excited about the work,'' said Dr. Jack Gorman, a
professor of psychiatry at Columbia and scientific director of the
Phobia, Stress and Anxiety Disorders Clinic at Long Island
Jewish-Hillside Medical Center. Gorman, an expert on panic conditions,
has been working with David Anderson of the National Institute on
Aging on a computerized bodysuit that can be used to measure the depth
and rate of breathing during a panic attack. Such a monitor could help
determine whether patients are suffering from a respiratory defect.

 Who Knows What Sleepers Lurk in Theaters This Summer? 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
HOLLYWOOD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few months ago, the special-effects-laden
action-comedy ``The Mask'' might have been considered a bona fide
summer sleeper. But now the New Line Cinema film starring a
green-faced Jim Carrey has developed such buzz in Hollywood that it is
projected to be one of the summer's hits.
</P>
<P>
``Speed,'' starring Keanu Reeves as a SWAT cop trying to save a
careening busload of passengers, also might have been considered a
summer sleeper earlier this year. Now advance screenings have created
positive word of mouth for the 20th Century Fox film, leaving some to
question whether the term ``sleeper'' applies anymore.
</P>
<P>
The real fun in Hollywood these days is predicting what movies
without big expectations will become box-office hits, along the lines
of last summer's surprise hits, ``Free Willy'' and ``Sleepless in
Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
If you listen to the studio publicity departments, you might
believe anything other than their biggest summer films are potential
sleepers.
</P>
<P>
Two baseball movies are now being hyped as summer sleepers:
``Angels in the Outfield'' with Danny Glover from Walt Disney/Caravan
and ``Little Big League'' with Jason Robards from Columbia.
</P>
<P>
Another touted sleeper is ``The Shadow,'' a Universal film about
the caped crime-fighter of radio lore, starring Alec Baldwin (``Who
knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The Shadow knows'').
</P>
<P>
But there are those who argue that all this talk about summer
sleepers is often designed by studios to start an undercurrent of hype
for certain films.
</P>
<P>
``They want you to believe that we made it for $80 million, but
it's a sleeper,'' said entertainment attorney David Colden, adding
sarcastically: ``Yeah ... ''
</P>
<P>
John Krier, president of Exhibitor Relations Inc., a motion picture
research company, is another who believes that when you look across
the landscape of films this summer, most really don't qualify as
sleeper candidates.
</P>
<P>
How can ``Angels in the Outfield'' be considered a sleeper, Krier
asked, when ``exhibitors are expecting big things from it?''
</P>
<P>
And he doesn't see how anyone can still say that ``Speed'' is a
summer sleeper, no matter what Fox executives might say.
</P>
<P>
``A sleeper is something that is unheralded and then pops up all of
a sudden,'' Krier said. It has a low to moderate budget, no big stars,
usually opens small, but benefits from good word of mouth and has
``legs,'' is either critically praised or trashed, has no heavy
advance promotion by the studio, does more at the box office than is
initially expected, and is usually not given the most advantageous
playing time.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Some current examples, Krier said, would be ``Ace Ventura: Pet
Detective,'' which came out of nowhere with comedian Carrey earlier
this year to gross $70 million, and ``Four Weddings and a Funeral,''
which has grossed $34 million.
</P>
<P>
``The Mask'' was a sleeper, he said, until exhibitors viewed the
trailer at the ShoWest exhibitors' convention in Las Vegas earlier
this year and loved it. Now, it would be a shock if it didn't succeed.
</P>
<P>
A film does not necessarily have to be devoid of stars to be
considered a sleeper.
</P>
<P>
Take ``Sleepless in Seattle,'' which last year grossed $126 million
for TriStar Pictures. ``It was a movie which had a fairly well-known
cast with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan and, given its cost and the subject
matter, would normally be expected to do about $20-$40 million at the
box office,'' said one source. ``Therefore, given the expectations the
film industry had for that movie, it could be called a sleeper.''
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
So, what are the real potential sleepers this summer?
</P>
<P>
If ``Andre'' -- a film about a 9-year-old girl and a lovable seal -- 
makes a big splash at the box office for Paramount Pictures, it would
be a bona fide sleeper, just as the killer-whale movie ``Free Willy''
was for Warners when it grossed $77 million.
</P>
<P>
They might also include ``Pulp Fiction,'' the Quentin Tarantino
paean to criminals starring John Travolta and Uma Thurman, which on
Monday won the Golden Palm award at Cannes; the super-hero adventure
comedy ``Blankman'' starring Damon Wayans; and, ``Airheads,'' a tale
of an unknown band that takes a radio station hostage to get some
airplay.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Or perhaps ``Fear of a Black Hat,'' a comedy rap version of ``This
Is Spinal Tap'' from the Samuel Goldwyn Co. will be the real summer
sleeper. A parody of a fictitious rap group called N.W.H., it has
tested well with middle-age, white male audiences, which could provide
it the crossover needed to become a financial hit.
</P>
<P>
Or maybe it will be an Andrew Bergman movie from Castle Rock
Entertainment called ``It Could Happen to You'' (Nicolas Cage, Bridget
Fonda), a little romantic film that some say hits all the right notes.
Bergman's ``Honeymoon in Vegas'' in 1992, after all, while not really
a sleeper, nevertheless became a big hit with audiences.
</P>
<P>
But would a comedy like ``In the Army Now'' starring Pauly Shore be
considered a sleeper if it did well? Not necessarily, say some
industry experts.
</P>
<P>
To become a true sleeper, ``In the Army Now'' would have to gross a
lot more than $30 million, because Pauly Shore movies usually pull in
that amount, said one source. If it makes $100 million, on the other
hand, it would be a true sleeper.

 Two Women, Two Eras, Two Role Models (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One was the perfect hostess who charmed the world and
redefined the title of first lady with her style, elegance and
dignity.
</P>
<P>
The other, a driven professional who wins admiration with her
eloquence, intellect and unflinching determination, is revolutionizing
the role of presidential spouse.
</P>
<P>
Three decades separate the reigns of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and
Hillary Rodham Clinton, and no two women better illustrate the sea
change in public perception of the ``ideal woman.''
</P>
<P>
``It's a very different image,'' said Brenda Castro, 50, one of
hundreds of longtime Jackie admirers who assembled at Arlington
National Cemetery Monday to bid her farewell. ``Jackie's from an era
of grace and elegance, when women were supposed to be charming
hostesses and adoring wives. Hillary is from a different era. She's
from an era when you should get an education and go out and make
change and be very verbal about it.''
</P>
<P>
But both women stand apart from other first ladies because they
epitomize -- Jackie for the 1960s and Hillary for the 1990s -- what a
woman ``should be.''
</P>
<P>
As she waited for the motorcade carrying Jackie Kennedy Onassis'
body, Jenifer Lucas, 48, of Arlington, Va., said the difference
between the two first ladies reflected the amazing metamorphosis
American women have made in recent years.
</P>
<P>
As a young woman in the early 1960s in Topeka, Kan., she said, she
aspired to be like Jackie Kennedy. ``She epitomized so much of what
girls of our age were brought up to think we should be,'' Lucas said.
</P>
<P>
But now, as an attorney for the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, she looks to Hillary Clinton as a role model.
</P>
<P>
``We grew up in a time when women were expected to be educated but
not have careers,'' she said. ``You were supposed to be a supportive
wife, a gracious hostess and a good mother. That was Jackie. Now women
are expected to have successful careers. That's Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
Castro, Lucas and other women gathered along the avenue leading to
the cemetery recalled the impact Jackie Kennedy had on American women
of all ages, ethnic backgrounds and economic classes, starting with
the 1960 presidential campaign. She showed them that a woman could be
a supportive wife and mother, dazzle people with her looks and still
have an identity of her own.
</P>
<P>
``I remember voting for her,'' Castro said enthusiastically, making
it clear that in her view, casting a vote for JFK was casting a vote
for Jackie as well. ``It was John and Jackie, not just John.''
</P>
<P>
Not until the Clintons started campaigning did Castro again feel
that she was supporting a couple and not just a candidate.
</P>
<P>
With her pillbox hats, command of foreign languages and dashing,
accomplished husband, Jackie was the standard of a successful woman in
the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
``Hillary does that now for people my age and younger because she
speaks on the issues we care about,'' Castro said. ``But she's a
totally different woman, and we admire different things in her. She's
intelligent, forceful without being aggressive, focused, directed,
accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
In Hillary Clinton's unprecedented 66-minute news conference in
April, she presented herself as a ``transitional'' first lady. Dressed
in pink to highlight her traditional femininity, she expertly defended
her role in making unusually successful investments for her family.
</P>
<P>
Doris Kearns Goodwin, the author of ``The Fitzgeralds and the
Kennedys,'' argues that Jackie Kennedy was also a transitional first
lady. Although she was praised for being ladylike and having unrivaled
fashion sense, she helped in her own way to open the door for the
women's movement.
</P>
<P>
``There was an independence in the way she approached the first
ladyship,'' Goodwin said. ``Even though she was doing traditional
feminine interests -- art, culture and fashion -- she was independent in
how she pursued them. She was a symbol of the coming independence of
women to do as they like.''
</P>
<P>
Goodwin stressed that it was much easier in the 1960s, when the
media spotlight did not shine so relentlessly, for a first lady to
become a public idol. People saw Jackie when she wanted to be seen,
and they hardly ever heard her speak. To most Americans, she was the
silent, dignified image that she projected on television screens and
in the newspapers.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
``Some of Jackie's majesty depended on her mystery,'' Goodwin said.
``I'm not sure that kind of political celebrity can exist today. We
know so much more today about everyone.''
</P>
<P>
Jackie Kennedy, for instance, was never pressed by reporters about
her husband's infidelities. But Hillary Clinton had to face such
questions before and after her husband came to office.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Hillary Clinton, who has described herself as a very private
person, clearly envies the distance Jackie Kennedy was able to create
between her family and the press. The morning after Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis died, Hillary Clinton told CNN how grateful she was for
conversations that the two first ladies had had about ``how she had
managed so well to carve out the space and privacy that children need
to grow into what they have a right to become.''
</P>
<P>
To be a role model in the 1990s, Goodwin said, takes a woman like
Hillary Clinton, who can dazzle the Senate with her intellect rather
than her wardrobe. ``What Hillary has going for her is a whole
generation of women trying to do what she's doing -- balancing a career
and a family life.''
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
If the Jackie Kennedy the world knew in the 1960s was in the White
House today, ``she would not have a connection to young women of
today's generation the way Hillary does,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
Paul Costello, deputy press secretary for former first lady
Rosalynn Carter, said the two first ladies are also exceptional among
the women who have held that title because they changed the job
description for the spouse of a president.
</P>
<P>
``Every first lady since Jackie Kennedy has been judged by the
standard of style and elegance that she set in the White House,''
Costello said. ``Every first lady post-Hillary will be judged by her
standard of substance.''
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
But not everyone agrees that Hillary Clinton represents the ideal
woman of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
``The way a first lady would more accurately reflect the evolution
of the role of a woman would be to leave the White House every day and
go to a job that is not dependent on her husband,'' said Sheila Tate,
press secretary first to Nancy Reagan and then to George Bush's
successful 1988 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
``Hillary Clinton's role is really no different from any other
first lady's because she has borrowed her husband's power. Very few
women in America have had authority handed to them. They have had to
earn it.''

If she had a Cesarean section, she would need eight weeks to heal.
</P>
<P>
If she had a vaginal birth, six weeks.
</P>
<P>
By then, she figured, her life would be back to normal. She would
be rested, ready to return to work, adjusted to her baby, with the
household running smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Right?
</P>
<P>
Wrong.
</P>
<P>
``It took me much longer than eight weeks,'' she recalls. ``I felt
better about the eighth month .''
</P>
<P>
Having spent her career nurturing others back to health, the irony
of the situation didn't escape Friedman, a certified lactation
consultant in Pasadena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of women would categorize having a baby as a
joyous event, full of rewards and moments of sheer delight. But when
the tears flow, it's often because society's benchmark for when new
mothers should be recovered -- six weeks to eight weeks -- is
unrealistic for many.
</P>
<P>
``A joke,'' says one woman, aptly.
</P>
<P>
``Ridiculous,'' says another.
</P>
<P>
``It's almost brutal,'' says Friedman.
</P>
<P>
Scientific studies -- and new mothers themselves -- attest to a much
longer adjustment period, something akin to a fourth trimester.
</P>
<P>
In a study published last year, researchers found that most women
need months -- maybe as much as a year -- to fully recover from
childbirth.
</P>
<P>
One month after delivery, women still complained of breast
problems, fatigue, hemorrhoids, poor appetite, constipation, increased
sweating, acne, hand numbness or tingling, dizziness and hot flashes.
</P>
<P>
Three months after delivery, many of these symptoms continue, the
study reported, while 40 percent of mothers also reported pain during
sexual intercourse, as well as respiratory infections and hair loss at
three to six months.
</P>
<P>
Even at nine months postpartum, many women said they experienced
vaginal discomfort and constipation.
</P>
<P>
And 20 percent reported problems related to sexual function one
year after childbirth, says researcher Dwenda K. Gjeringen of the
University of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, as many as 10 percent of women suffer postpartum
depression in the months following childbirth, other research has
shown. Postpartum depression is a severe mood disorder linked to
changing hormones in which stress and fatigue can play a major role.
</P>
<P>
Even without experiencing such a serious postpartum illness,
``Recovery from childbirth often requires more than the six weeks
traditionally allotted,'' Gjeringen says.
</P>
<P>
Baby is now 2 months old and signs are everywhere that Mother
should be up to speed.
</P>
<P>
At six or eight weeks, disability payments usually stop -- a
not-so-subtle hint that a woman should now be ready to return to work.
</P>
<P>
Yet, according to Gjeringen's study, the postpartum adjustment
period is especially hard for women who return to the work force -- 
about half of all new mothers -- soon after childbirth. The average
working woman takes eight weeks off for childbirth, according to 9 to
5, the National Association of Working Women.
</P>
<P>
At six weeks, the last visit with the obstetrician takes place.
That is when, according to medical textbooks, the uterus has returned
to its non-reproductive state.
</P>
<P>
Using that as the benchmark of recovery, physicians pronounce most
of their patients fit and ready to resume sexual relations. Never mind
that the typical patient is still 20 pounds overweight, exhausted and
sore.
</P>
<P>
There is also a tacit assumption in many quarters that the mother
should have her baby on some kind of schedule at six weeks. After all,
when are the in-laws ever wrong?
</P>
<P>
In truth, the postpartum adjustment period differs greatly among
women, and recovery simply cannot be predicted or planned, experts
say.
</P>
<P>
``A lot of it depends on whether the baby is an easy baby or not,''
says Sandy Hill, the owner of a Southern California parent-care
service called After the Stork. For example, some babies have health
problems, develop colic, are hard to feed, sleep fitfully or are
ill-tempered.
</P>
<P>
``Women often say, `What's wrong with me? I'm not adjusting. Why is
this so hard?' But it's usually because the baby is a difficult
baby,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Physically, too, recovery varies widely.
</P>
<P>
``The physical recovery is usually much slower than what people
expect,'' says psychologist Georgiana G. Rodiger, a mother of five and
founder of the Rodiger Center in Pasadena. ``Childbirth is a much more
traumatic -- especially for a first birth -- than most people care to
describe. And one of the worst parts is you don't get sleep. That goes
on for months.''
</P>
<P>
Some new mothers also feel pressure to lose all their added weight
a couple months after childbirth. If a woman is returning to work at
six weeks, she's lucky if her regular clothes even fit, Friedman says.
</P>
<P>
``Most of us have body-image issues at that time,'' she says. ``But
it's very natural not to have lost the weight at that point.''
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Postpartum recovery is clearly on the fast track these days,
beginning from the moment of birth.
</P>
<P>
It is common now for women who have an uncomplicated vaginal birth
to be discharged in one day and women who undergo C-sections in three
days.
</P>
<P>
And, under some insurance policies, childbirth is just a pit stop:
Women with vaginal births go home in eight to 12 hours. ``These
mothers are still in a fog,'' Friedman says. ``I'm trying to tell them
how to change a diaper and they're saying `What?' ''
</P>
<P>
The trend in early discharge and a light-speed postpartum recovery
sometimes seems like a backlash to the days a generation ago when new
mothers spent five to seven days in the hospital and came home to a
supportive extended family and a neighborhood full of
casserole-bearing, stay-at-home moms.
</P>
<P>
``In the old days, the mother was in bed and everyone said, `Oh,
that's ridiculous -- this isn't an illness,' '' notes Susan, a Los
Angeles woman who asked that her full name not be used. ``Then it
became a thing of who can get out the door the quickest.''
</P>
<P>
New mothers who refuse to get with the program are subject to
ridicule, says Lola Clark Tirre, a herbalist and mother of three who
lives in San Clemente, Calif.
</P>
<P>
``I don't think it's respected if a woman says she is going to stay
home and bond with her baby for several weeks. People think you are
kind of kooky.''
</P>
<P>
Not many women have the luxury of staying home and cocooning, says
Linda Juergens, director of the New York-based National Association of
Mothers' Centers, a network of non-profit discussion groups.
</P>
<P>
``Certain societies have ways of relieving new mothers of duties as
she recovers and having a mentoring period with other mothers. In our
society, we have nothing built in to support a new mother. The
extended family is gone.''
</P>
<P>
Part of the solution to the cultural crisis facing today's new moms
may be a return to old customs.
</P>
<P>
For example, new moms are increasingly joining breast-feeding or
parenting organizations, says Friedman, the owner of two stores that
carry lactation equipment and clothing. At her Mothers with Style
store in Glendale, Calif., women meet weekly for support.
</P>
<P>
Women are not only helped individually, but a forum is created for
them to air their concerns, says Juergens, of the National Assocation
of Mothers' Centers.
</P>
<P>
``As a national organization, our hope is to raise the
consciousness among people about these issues,'' she says. ``We want
to expand the maternal voice and get women to feel entitled to make
their needs and wants known.''

 Are There Male Bimbos? 
 Sweeney is editorial page editor of The Greenwich Time. 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that Paula Jones has filed her lawsuit accusing Bill Clinton of
sexual harassment, America once again is tossing around the word
``bimbo,'' using it to describe Jones in a pejorative way, usually in
defense of the president.
</P>
<P>
I can't imagine anyone hasn't heard about the case. Jones contends
that when Clinton was Arkansas governor and she was on the state
payroll, she was brought to meet him in a hotel room, where he dropped
his pants and propositioned her. Jones said she refused and left, but
that hasn't kept people from referring to her as a bimbo, though some
people who say they knew her as a ``party girl'' might think the term
is apt.
</P>
<P>
So the word bimbo is back, just as it was used to describe Tonya
Harding, Gennifer Flowers, or Donna Rice (remember Gary Hart and the
good ship ``Monkey Business''?).
</P>
<P>
For a country that is being accused more and more of embracing
attitudes that are politically correct, this kind of linguistic
behavior strikes me as a serious lapse, and one that isn't positive.
It seems that the nation has come to accept the term bimbo without
considering the connotations it has.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it's best to define exactly what a bimbo is. Webster's New
World Dictionary lists three slang definitions, of which the third is
most pertinent to the current usage: ``a sexually promiscuous woman.''
The second definition -- ``a silly or stupid person: used especially of
a woman'' -- often seems to be implicit when people speak of bimbos,
too. After talking with people about what they consider the essence
of, well, call it bimbosity, I think you also need to add that the
popular notion of a bimbo involves someone who dresses provocatively,
usually in tight, revealing clothing.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, I can't think of anyone who uses the first definition,
deemed old slang by the dictionary: ``a guy, fellow.'' In fact, the
whole notion of a bimbo seems to be quite gender-specific. There seems
to be no male equivalent. Would you, for example, think of Joey
Buttafuoco as a male bimbo? How about Fabio? See what I mean?
</P>
<P>
Sure, men have been called hunks, but that term seems pretty
passive when compared to what we mean when we refer to a woman as a
bimbo. Think for a moment of the TV commercial that portrays women
leering at a bare-chested construction worker. The guy, I'm told, is a
hunk. But he's not dealing in sexuality; he's just taken off his shirt
because he's perspiring. On the other hand, do you think the women
doing the leering are bimbos? Maybe yes, maybe no, right?
</P>
<P>
Then there is the term ``stud,'' which certainly carries a sexual
connotation. Yet it isn't the same kind of pejorative that bimbo is. I
can't imagine any women considering bimbo a positive description, but
there are plenty of men who would welcome being called a stud. And we
better forget about the word womanizer, which has such an elite
connotation to it you almost picture someone in a pin-striped suit and
wing-tips. Think of it this way: JFK was a womanizer; Judith Exner was
a bimbo. Note the difference.
</P>
<P>
All of which makes me wonder exactly how far we have come toward
gender equality. The word bimbo reinforces the stereotype of a woman
using sexuality to promote herself. That there is no equivalent male
term is significant, but not as important as the fact that we seem
willing to use the word bimbo unquestioningly. Women use it, too,
including some women who pride themselves on promoting feminist
equality. That is perhaps the ultimate irony, for it pretty
effectively undercuts the notion of women being held to the same
standards as men, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
Some of the newer feminist writers surely would criticize the
notion of women ever being bimbos. Among this group, dubbed the
``do-me feminists'' by Esquire magazine, are those who believe women
finally are acting sexually demanding in much the same way men
traditionally have. They would find the notion of sexually promiscuous
behavior to be just fine, without any of the negative connotations
that the word bimbo would conjure up.
</P>
<P>
But society seems ill at ease with the idea of a woman who leers at
men, dresses to enhance her sexuality, or even enjoys the pleasures of
the flesh. Hence the continued use of the word bimbo in a way that can
only be considered demeaning, not only to the woman being labeled, but
to women in general. Thinking about it that way, we can be certain the
double standard is alive and well, despite all the efforts by women -- 
and men -- to try to level the playing field for both genders.
</P>
<P>
What is perhaps surprising, however, is the rancor Jones has
stirred through her lawsuit. People across a broad spectrum have come
to Clinton's defense. Even Gennifer Flowers, who claims to have had a
longtime affair with Clinton, says Jones' story doesn't ring true.
</P>
<P>
Based on that, Jones might be the only person I can think of who
could be accused of giving bimbos a bad name.

 ON THE BEACH: Ordeal at Charlie's Market 
 Al Martinez 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LOS ANGELES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I was a kid, I stole a bag of doughnuts once
from a grocery store. They were glazed doughnuts in a brown bag. I did
it because we were poor and I was hungry, and because it was an
exciting thing to do.
</P>
<P>
I hid the doughnuts inside a jacket and sidled out of the store as
casually as I could, but I was a clumsy thief and the grocer, a man
named Fred Barnes, saw me.
</P>
<P>
He shouted ``Hey!'' and came after me, red-faced and snorting fire,
and cornered me in an alley about a block away.
</P>
<P>
I made a run at him to try knocking him out of the way, but he
caught me by the nape of the neck, marched me back to the store and
took my name and address.
</P>
<P>
He said he'd be notifying my parents and juvenile authorities and I
would be catching everyone's hell in just a few days.
</P>
<P>
Which brings me to Aldo Vega.
</P>
<P>
He stole a box of cookies from a place called Charlie's Market and
also was a clumsy thief.
</P>
<P>
The owner of the market, Michael Kim, saw him. Aldo, a 14-year-old,
took off. Kim jumped in his car and caught him three blocks away. Then
he shot him.
</P>
<P>
He did it, Kim said, because the boy with Aldo had a knife. No
knife was found, but a screwdriver was later recovered. He did it, Kim
said, because Aldo appeared to be reaching for a weapon. There was no
weapon, but Aldo admits hiking up his shirt and reaching into his
pocket.
</P>
<P>
There was just that damned box of cookies scattered on the
sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
No criminal charges were filed against Kim because the kid stole
cookies, didn't he, and Kim feared for his life, didn't he? Cookie
thieves are notorious for murdering grocers.
</P>
<P>
The case was instantly compared to the killing of 15-year-old
Latasha Harlins in Compton, Calif., three years ago. She was shot dead
by grocer Soon Ja Du after the two had struggled over a $1.79 bottle
of orange juice.
</P>
<P>
Du was fined $500 and placed on probation. Few killers are granted
such an easy way out.
</P>
<P>
Aldo didn't die. The bullet fired from Kim's .38 missed his heart.
The district attorney's office announced magnanimously that it would
not file shoplifting charges against him.
</P>
<P>
There are similarities between the shootings of Latasha and Aldo.
Both guns were fired by Korean Americans, though Latasha was black and
Aldo is Latino. Both shootings were set in motion by the theft of
items worth less than $2.
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles District Attorney Gil Garcetti said no charges would be
filed against Kim because no prosecutable crime occurred.
Commentators, defending Kim's actions, pointed out that 35 Korean
American owners of small businesses have been shot in L.A. in the past
year. He had a right not to become No. 36.
</P>
<P>
But Chicano activist Armando Sotomayor cut through the statistics
and legal justification when he stood on the steps of the Criminal
Courts Building and said, ``You don't shoot a 14-year-old boy over a
49-cent box of cookies.''
</P>
<P>
There are those who see the shooting of a Latino by a Korean as a
racial incident. I don't. I see it as a metaphor of the time and place
in which we live, in a society packaged by violence and summarized by
clashing rights.
</P>
<P>
Aldo Vega had no right to steal from the store. Michael Kim had a
right to pursue him. Aldo Vega had no right to make a threatening
gesture. Michael Kim had a right to defend himself.
</P>
<P>
Rights are endlessly debated in a nation that revolves around them.
But the debate ends when guns are fired.
</P>
<P>
There are an estimated 200 million firearms in private hands in
this country, and arguments are increasingly terminated, and rights
defended, by their use.
</P>
<P>
Homeowners shoot at intruders, car owners shoot at thieves,
property owners shoot at trespassers ... and grocery store owners
shoot at kids who steal orange juice and cookies.
</P>
<P>
No one will ever know whether Kim actually feared for his life or
was trying, in his way, to teach a lesson. Give him the benefit of the
doubt. He was in a state of terror.
</P>
<P>
But I can't help wondering what would have happened to me those
many years ago had similar conditions existed. Would Fred Barnes have
armed himself, pursued me and shot me dead when I lunged at him?
</P>
<P>
I doubt it. We were a different world back then, less prone to
cause pain and more inclined to weigh the value of a human life
against the loss of a grocery product.
</P>
<P>
Barnes took my name, but never turned me in. I lived in fear for
weeks that he might, and the fear stamped its message on my life. The
grocer taught a lesson without a shot being fired.
</P>
<P>
You didn't shoot a kid over a bag of doughnuts back then. Sadly,
things have changed. Michael Kim and Aldo Vega, thrust together in the
context of petty crime and excessive punishment, will symbolize that
change for a long time to come.

 Resurrection of Poussin's `Crucifixion' (Hartford) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
HARTFORD, Conn.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Visitors to the Wadsworth Atheneum in recent
years have been mystified by the increasingly dark, murky appearance
of the ``Crucifixion,'' a 17th-century masterwork by the great French
painter Nicolas Poussin.
</P>
<P>
The work's spectral shapes shrouded in gloom had over time
unaccountably darkened far beyond Poussin's original, deliberately
somber palette.
</P>
<P>
But now, thanks to a two-year conservation project, the once
ghostly figures have emerged from shadowy mists.
</P>
<P>
Viewers can once again see how Poussin, a master storyteller, made
his characters -- the crucified Christ on the cross, the Virgin Mary,
Mary Magdalen, Roman soldiers casting dice for Christ's garments, a
centurion on a rearing horse, crucified thieves, a resurrected body
dramatically bursting from its rocky grave and other characters in the
cast at Calvary -- play off one another like a powerful ensemble on
stage.
</P>
<P>
A deeply devout Catholic, Poussin portrayed the crucifixion at the
moment of Christ's death, a tumultuous time when, the New Testament
says, the heavens darkened, graves heaved open and bodies of saints
were raised from the dead.
</P>
<P>
The newly restored painting is being displayed in a
before-and-after exhibition called ``Restoring a French Masterpiece:
Poussin's `Crucifixion.''' Installed in the second-floor Connector
Gallery, it runs through July 31.
</P>
<P>
Treating the nearly 350-year-old painting much like an ill, elderly
patient, chief conservator Stephen Kornhauser and conservator Patricia
Garland first had to diagnose the cause of the baffling darkening
effect. The two sleuth-like conservators also unearthed evidence
revealing what they believe to be the cause of the painting's painful
surface affliction called ``cupping,'' a blistering effect in which
paint curls up in cup-like patches.
</P>
<P>
To get to the bottom of the enigmatic darkening process, the
Atheneum dispatched the painting and the two conservators to
California to the Getty Conservation Institute, a prestigious
scientific/diagnostic clinic for ailing artworks.
</P>
<P>
Probing for clues in the painting's skin and body chemistry, Getty
scientists discovered a suspicious, foreign substance, a resin
possibly from a tree of the balsam, pine or spruce families lurking in
pigment samples.
</P>
<P>
Such resins were most unusual for 17th-century paintings. But in
the 19th century, the resin copaiva balsam was often rubbed onto
paintings to lighten a dark surface, Kornhauser says.
</P>
<P>
Based on the Getty lab's findings, Garland and Kornhauser theorize
that some unknown 19th-century restorer tried to lighten the Poussin's
naturally dark surface with copaiva balsam, a common practice of that
period, they say. So here at last was the villain of the piece, the
guilty agent of the painting's darkening malaise.
</P>
<P>
``It looks great for a while,'' Garland explains of the balsam's
initially lightening effect, ``but then it darkens itself, and it just
keeps darkening and darkening.''
</P>
<P>
Before the painting was purchased by the Atheneum in 1935, other
unknown hands had tried to lighten the painting's original dark tones
by cleaning it with caustic solutions, Garland and Kornhauser say. But
that caustic cleaner brought not lighter tones but abrasions to the
surface.
</P>
<P>
Last summer the conservators began operating on their patient,
attempting to restore the splendid old invalid to a condition as close
as possible to its original state when Poussin painted it for his
friend, the French abbot Jacques Auguste de Thou, a member of the
French Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The restoration process was a struggle not only against the natural
ravages of aging, but also against earlier, abortive attempts in
pre-Atheneum days to conserve or brighten the painting that was never
meant to be bright.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
First, the conservators removed coats of discolored varnish and
layers of old retouching. Then, to reconstruct lost areas of paint,
they employed a process called ``inpainting,'' the exacting task of
matching colors with the original pigments and re-creating damaged
forms by knitting together fragments of the original that remain.
</P>
<P>
As a reference point, the conservators used a 17th-century copy of
the work attributed to Antoine Bouzonnet-Stella, a friend of Poussin
and an established artist of that period. The copy was especially
helpful in understanding the original's most damaged areas, the
conservators say. Borrowed from a Swiss collection, the copy will be
part of the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
``It was a very long and agonizing process. It was even agonizing
to decide whether we should do it or not,'' Kornhauser says.
</P>
<P>
Because the painting's condition was so critical, there was an
almost ethical/medical question about whether operating on it would
bring more gain than pain, or even perhaps permanent loss, Kornhauser
says.
</P>
<P>
``We weigh every decision about a major treatment like this very,
very carefully and try to figure out what the benefits are. As part of
all these preliminary visual examinations, we were able to see there
was an enormous amount of loss and weren't sure what we would gain.
Each individual painting is treated as an individual object, just as a
doctor would treat his or her patients,'' Garland says.
</P>
<P>
Besides displaying the resurrection of clarity and drama in the
``Crucifixion,'' the exhibition documents the conservators' findings
on the causes of the painting's baffling pigmentation problem and its
severe skin abrasions.
</P>
<P>
X-ray photos, infra-red photography, blown-up photos of microcosmic
areas of the canvas and, of course, a color photo of the painting
before it underwent conservation are part of the exhibition and give
it an almost clinical ambiance.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
The ``Crucifixion,'' which is the Atheneum's only Poussin, will go
to Paris to be exhibited at the Louvre from Sept. 27 through Jan. 2,
1995. From there it goes to London where it will be shown at the Royal
Academy from Jan. 20 to April 16 before its return to Hartford. In the
Louvre, with its new facelift, it will hang alongside other
masterworks by Poussin in an exhibition marking the 400th anniversary
of the French master's birth.
</P>
<P>
Considered France's greatest painter of the 17th century, Poussin
was born in Normandy in 1594 and died in 1665 in Rome, then the art
capital of the world.
</P>
<P>
Cardinal Richelieu, eminence grise to French King Louis XIII, and
even King Louis, fervently courted Poussin, the expatriate, trying to
convince him to come home again from Italy and become France's
permanent royal superstar painter. But Poussin spent virtually all of
his fruitful career in Italy, although he did return to his native
land for a year and a half to serve as chief painter at the French
court. But this was a most unpleasant experience that drove him back
to his beloved Rome, where he remained for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
Jean Cadogan, the Atheneum's curator of European art, notes in her
exhibition essay that, yes, the restored ``Crucifixion'' is ``still
dark and in some cases mysterious.''
</P>
<P>
Yet the figures ``are now more legible, their gestures and
placement describe the narrative action of the subject, and (the
painting) tells the story of the Crucifixion in a dramatic and moving
way, as Poussin intended it should.'' Cadogan says the conservation
has also restored the painting's dramatic, three-dimensional quality,
one of Poussin's stylistic hallmarks.
</P>
<P>
``I'm confident now,'' the curator says, ``that when we put this
painting in the Paris show with the rest of the Poussins, including
all the great Poussins in the Louvre, it's going to take its place
rather than look like an anomaly.''

 Emerging Democracies in Danger of Sliding Back to Authoritarianism 
 Brysk is an assistant professor of politics at Pomona College 
 and author of ``The Politics of Human Rights in Argentina'' 
 (Stanford University Press.)
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Photos of newly enfranchised voters thronging polling places have
become commonplace, from Russia to South Africa to El Salvador. But
just as Americans begin to replace our image of the guerrilla with the
citizen, nagging rips appear at the edges of the new picture. Why has
democracy been reversed so quickly in Peru, Haiti and Serbia? Will
political openings in Mexico and Indochina be endangered by social
unrest?
</P>
<P>
We Americans are notorious for our optimism, our pragmatism and our
lack of historical consciousness. As the world democratizes, our
optimistic assumption of a clean slate imperils the pragmatism
necessary for making policy.
</P>
<P>
Elections, we must remember, are a necessary but not a sufficient
condition for democracy. If elections do not include major sectors of
society (like peasants or former communists) or address key issues
(like land reform or economic adjustment), new citizens will quickly
become alienated and anti-system. Democracy must also include human
rights, civilian control of the military and some measure of
accountability for the new government once it has been elected.
Citizenship implies empowerment, and elections are only the first step
in that process.
</P>
<P>
Rather than treat emerging democracies as infant republics, it is
appropriate to see them as ``recovering authoritarians.'' Like
recovering alcoholics, new democracies emerge damaged by a pattern of
learned behavior to which they will always be especially susceptible.
The bad news is that these countries' heritage will often war with
their institutions. The good news is that this heritage is not
cultural or eternal; learned behavior can be unlearned and the
analysis of common patterns may help manage recovery. Thus, we should
not be surprised at the problems shared by recovering authoritarians
in all parts of the world: poverty, policing and polarization.
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the previous level or path of economic development,
recovering authoritarians experience poverty because unaccountable
states have been inefficient and predatory economic managers. This is
more than the conventional wisdom about distorting markets;
market-oriented authoritarians have also dismantled infrastructure and
looted the national patrimony.
</P>
<P>
New democracies often face a crisis of policing because social
order has never been rooted in a social contract that rewards
restraint with security and opportunity. When massive coercion is
removed -- or shifted from the military or secret police to the police
proper -- no ``thin blue line'' can stem the tide of self-seeking,
anti-social behavior by citizens bereft of social guarantees or
guidance.
</P>
<P>
Finally, democratizing societies quickly polarize along lines of
ethnicity, class and ideology. Civil societies never developed where
social institutions such as churches were controlled by the state or
closed off entirely. In many cases, a society temporarily integrated
by the authoritarian regime -- or by opposition to it -- suddenly
collapses with the transition to democracy.
</P>
<P>
What is to be done? As sympathetic outsiders, we cannot repair the
damage of authoritarianism but we can support, with our policies, the
general principles of recovery. First, the recovering polity itself
must accept responsibility and come to terms with the past. This may
involve measures such as human-rights investigations (as in Chile) or
reconstruction of social and economic infrastructure (as in East
Germany). We also need to make it clear that new democracies cannot
afford the ``first drink'' of a postponed election or suspended
constitution. Finally, the world community can form support groups for
democratization and its challenges. The Organization of American
States seems to be moving toward this role for Latin America.
Different cases will require different levels of U.S. involvement.
Where possible, however, we must provide reparations and multilateral
support. At the same time, we must shed the dysfunctional bonds that
all too often propped up the previous authoritarian regime.

 LITTWIN COMMENTARY: The Capriati Descent Should Surprise No One 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jennifer Capriati, little Jenny of the bouncy smile and sparkly
eyes, is in a drug rehab center. She was allegedly caught holding some
dope in a semi-seedy hotel room. The guy who was with her said they
spent the weekend there, partying on booze and drugs.
</P>
<P>
She's the bright little girl gone bad, and there's much wringing of
hands as to what went wrong, as if we didn't know.
</P>
<P>
It's an ugly, sordid mess that is in no way surprising. Actually,
there's one surprise: that she's the first of the tennis teen
prodigies to end up like this.
</P>
<P>
Of course, she was the first to do a lot of things. The youngest to
win a match at Wimbledon. The youngest to be a semifinalist at a
grand-slam event. She was 13 when she joined the tennis tour and 17
when she left, saying she wanted to go to high school and live a
normal life.
</P>
<P>
Ah, the normal life. For her, normal life as a high school student
meant her own apartment in a different city from where her parents
live.
</P>
<P>
She's 18 now and in big trouble.
</P>
<P>
Surprising?
</P>
<P>
You try growing up the way she did. You try living out your puberty
in the living room of strangers.
</P>
<P>
You try being 15 and having to explain to the TV camera why you
lost in the first round of a tournament.
</P>
<P>
You try to figure out wrong from right when right apparently means
being pushed by your parents to grab everything you can as soon as you
can and worry about the future some other time.
</P>
<P>
What's amazing is how many of the young people who grow up this way
turn out all right.
</P>
<P>
I first knew for sure that something was very wrong when Capriati,
then 14, was playing an exhibition match for $20,000 -- on a school
night. She had already signed several million-dollar endorsements.
What was she doing out there? Who was that money for?
</P>
<P>
Let's consider the ordinary, hormone-driven, late-night-tears,
minor-rebellions, life-is-too-much-to-bear adolescence. You may have
teen-age kids, or you may have been one yourself. In either case, you
should know what I'm talking about.
</P>
<P>
You're either too tall, short, fat, thin, smart, dumb. And nobody
likes you. Or nobody knows you. You've been there.
</P>
<P>
Some kids carry extra burdens. They are prodigies of a kind. They
play piano, except not like our kids do. Or they swim. Or they dance.
They have special gifts that need to be treated in a special way.
</P>
<P>
But most get to explore their talents in relative privacy.
</P>
<P>
Even child actors, who grow up on the screen, don't have to face
the press every day to explain their defeats or to tell their life
stories as if they'd had any time to live lives yet.
</P>
<P>
On the tennis tour, there is everyday pressure that breaks grown
men and women, much less kids too young to drive.
</P>
<P>
Putting your 13-year-old out there is a form of child abuse. It's
that simple. And we're all to blame. We think they're so cute, these
little darlings in pigtails. Capriati got her millions in endorsements
based on that principle. Once she got in trouble, the endorsements
vanished.
</P>
<P>
The fact is that nearly all who turn pro by age 14 -- Tracy Austin
or Andrea Jaeger come to mind -- break down, usually physically.
</P>
<P>
Is there a rush? Will the money disappear?
</P>
<P>
We watched little Jenny grow up, and I've heard the talk about how
we should have known there was trouble ahead. You see, a few years
ago, she painted her nails black. She wears four earrings at a time.
She even has a ring for her nostril. And, yes, she was caught
shoplifting.
</P>
<P>
She must be ... a kid.
</P>
<P>
Her father said it was just a teen-age problem. He was right. And
he was wrong. It's a teen-age problem that many kids face, except few
have to read about it in the morning paper.
</P>
<P>
Monica Seles, while still a teen-ager, mysteriously skipped
Wimbledon one year. She ended up on an estate owned by Donald Trump.
Can you imagine a worse call: ``Dad, I'm staying with The Donald for a
while.''
</P>
<P>
The papers were all over that one. There were the rumors, including
one that she had gotten pregnant. One columnist wrote that she and
Billy Joe McAllister were seen throwing something off the Tallahatchee
bridge.
</P>
<P>
Growing up is hard. It gets harder every day in this speeded-up
world of too many temptations and too little supervision. Throw fame
and money and high-stakes pressure into the mix, and you can end up
like Capriati. She's 18, and under the law, she's responsible for her
acts. She's responsible, but who's to blame?

 KIDS' HEALTH: Tomboyishness Not a Problem if Daughter Is Happy 
 Dr. Wilson is director of general pediatrics at the Johns Hopkins 
 Children's Center; Dr. Joffe is director of adolescent medicine. 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q: My 11-year-old daughter is a real tomboy. She likes to dress
casually, hangs around boys and really doesn't have many girlfriends.
Should I be concerned?
</P>
<P>
A: As long as your daughter seems happy, is doing well at school
and does not complain or appear concerned about her choice of friends
and activities, you can be reassured that she is quite all right. Her
decision to hang around boys likely reflects the fact that at this
point in her life, she finds their activities challenging and in line
with her own interests. Being a tomboy at age 11, however, does not
indicate that she will continue to share these same interests as she
gets older nor does it imply that she will be ``manly'' when she
reaches adulthood. It is impossible to predict what she will be like
in the future as she progresses through adolescence and beyond.

 ON CALL: Skin Must Be Monitored Carefully After Cancer 
 Margolis is professor of medicine and biological chemistry at the 
 Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q: When my husband recently had a skin cancer removed from the
face, he was told that he was cured and need not worry that the cancer
had spread to any other place. I though all cancers could spread, and
I am concerned that my husband's doctor just reassured him so that he
wouldn't worry. Is there anything further he should be doing?
</P>
<P>
A: The three common types of skin cancer are basal cell carcinoma,
melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Melanomas and squamous cell
carcinomas DO spread (metastasize) to other body sites. It is more
likely that your husband had a basal cell carcinoma because it is by
far the most common type of skin cancer. If this is the case, his
doctor was not trying to keep your husband from worrying.
</P>
<P>
Basal cell cancers continue to grow slowly and rarely spread to
other sites in the body. More than 90 percent of people are completely
cured when the carcinoma is removed surgically or treated with liquid
nitrogen, although if left to grow over time, it can invade and
destroy nearby tissue. Exposure to the ultraviolet rays of the sun is
believed to be the principal cause of basal cell cancers. As a result,
they tend to occur on those areas of the skin most commonly in
fair-skinned people who have relatively little melanin to protect them
against the sun's rays.
</P>
<P>
Your husband should take measures to avoid excessive exposure to
sunlight, since the presence of one basal cell carcinoma increases the
risk that others may develop in the future. He should, for example,
avoid direct sunlight during the middle of the day, use protective
clothing, such as hats and shirts with long sleeves, apply a sunscreen
before going out into the sun and, of course, avoid sunlamps and
tanning booths. He should examine the skin regularly for the
appearance of new growths and make an appointment with his doctor if
any are found. A biopsy is necessary to make the diagnosis. In any
case, He should see his physician at least once a year for a full skin
exam.

 A Plea Bargain, a Health Plan -- a Conflict? 
 Uhlmann is a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center 
 in Washington. 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First, the facts:
</P>
<P>
-- The House Ways and Means Committee is the most powerful committee
in Congress. Membership is highly prized and aggressively sought. Even
junior members acquire a certain cachet among their colleagues. They
also get noticed by lobbyists, who pay inordinate attention to what
goes on in Ways and Means -- and to the political fortunes of its
members. Not for nothing is the hallway outside the committee hearing
room known as ``Gucci Gulch.''
</P>
<P>
-- The Ways and Means chairman, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., -- 
``Rosty'' -- is one of Washington's most famous faces and a man no
president can safely ignore. That's because the committee's
jurisdiction includes the crown jewels of the modern state, including
international trade, Social Security and welfare entitlements, tax
bills of every description and health-care financing. President
Clinton has become particularly dependent on Rostenkowski because his
political future is staked on matters that must pass through Ways and
Means before they become law. Clinton's only notable legislative
achievements to date, the North American Free Trade Agreement and his
tax bill, both owe their success to Rostenkowski's formidable clout.
Nothing will happen on welfare reform unless Rostenkowski nods and,
without him, Clinton's health-care reform proposal doesn't have a
prayer.
</P>
<P>
-- Not surprisingly, the president and the chairman have become
political intimates. The president went out of his way to support
Rostenkowski during a hotly contested primary earlier this year, even
appearing at a Chicago fund-raiser. (Memory does not recall the last
time a sitting president made a personal appearance during a
congressional primary fight.)
</P>
<P>
-- Rostenkowski has been in political hot water since 1992, when it
was revealed that the U.S. attorney's office in Washington was
investigating him for fraud, misuse of government funds and payroll
padding. Rostenkowski denies the charges, but indications are that a
felony indictment is near. Under the rules of the House, a felony
indictment would require Rostenkowski to resign as Ways and Means
chairman, a step that would almost certainly doom the president's
prized health-care proposal. On the other hand, something less than a
felony indictment would enable Rostenkowski not only to retain his
chairmanship but also to avoid the shame and burden of grave criminal
sanction.
</P>
<P>
-- Rostenkowski dismissed his first lawyer last year and retained
Robert Bennett -- yes, the same respected criminal defense attorney who
became a household name a few weeks ago when the president tapped him
to defend against Paula Corbin Jones' sexual-harassment charges.
</P>
<P>
-- The Rostenkowski investigation is clearly headed toward its
denouement. Plea-bargaining is under way between Bennett and the
Justice Department, although it is not clear who is negotiating for
the government. One story has it that Atty. Gen. Janet Reno will
follow the recommendation of the U.S. attorney, come what may. Another
has it that Bennett, dissatisfied with progress at lower levels, is
seeking to take the negotiation ``upstairs'' within the department.
But neither the ordinarily garrulous Bennett, nor Reno nor the White
House is commenting directly. The major participants, in short, are
being unusually mum about one of the more dramatic events now on the
Washington stage.
</P>
<P>
Now, some questions:
</P>
<P>
Do you suppose the White House might have a political interest in
the outcome of the plea-bargaining with Rostenkowski? Do you think it
likely that someone in the White House may have spoken to someone in
the Justice Department about it? Do you think it likely that the
president has spoken with his counsel (or vice versa) about it? What
do you suppose goes through the minds of Justice Department political
appointees when the man they know to be the president's personal
lawyer negotiates on behalf of the president's most powerful ally on
Capitol Hill?
</P>
<P>
What do you suppose Clinton's lawyer is saying to Rostenkowski's
lawyer about all this? To avoid a conflict or an appearance of a
conflict, it is sometimes necessary for one lawyer to wall himself
from others in the same firm, but how does an attorney erect a Chinese
Wall within his own brain?
</P>
<P>
Does anything about the foregoing bother you? If a non-felony plea
bargain is negotiated, would you be surprised? Before that happens,
don't you think it would be a good idea if the press started asking
some hard questions?

 Struggling in Vain to Be Forever Young 
 Gabriel writes a weekly column for The Advocate. 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We can tell ourselves we're not getting older, we're getting
better, but do we really believe it?
</P>
<P>
For women, the passage of time can become downright threatening
when they reach 40-something.
</P>
<P>
I'm not speaking about myself, of course. I've reached the
accommodation between me then and me now. Aside from the occasional
shock when I'm passing a mirror and see the streaks of gray in my hair
or the added couple of inches at my waist, I know that getting older
is the only option if one plans on continuing to live.
</P>
<P>
But I understand the women who gaze at themselves anxiously,
wondering whether the time has come for the first facelift -- even if
it is a pre-emptive strike at this point. I understand the anxiety
tinged with despair that colors their voices when they talk about
becoming middle-aged.
</P>
<P>
They don't want to be fat. They don't want to be gray. They don't
want to be wrinkled. They want gravity to go away, so that whatever
has begun to sag will suddenly lift, as if they were 20 again.
</P>
<P>
Some of this anxiety is of our own making. Women -- all of us -- are
taught to put way too much stock in the way we look, as if we're some
prized race horse or heifer whose vital statistics define us and
determine our value.
</P>
<P>
But some of the anxiety is caused by societal expectations. Young
is beautiful, especially when it comes to women. Sean Connery can play
007 until he's almost 60, but the female objects of his desire don't
age with him. They are still the nubile things of 20- or 30-something
that he always courted. Men can age and be just as appealing as
they've always been. It's a lot harder for women.
</P>
<P>
We strive to contain the cellulite, wash away the gray, tuck the
tummy. Each birthday seems to be a call for action.
</P>
<P>
I remember one friend whose birthday present one year to herself
was liposuction. She felt it was the gift that kept on giving, because
it restored her girlish figure without her having to do 200 sit-ups a
night.
</P>
<P>
Another friend I know disappeared for a week and returned with a
face that was taut where it had begun to sag. ``How do you like my
face?'' she asked me.
</P>
<P>
``I've always liked your face, and I still do,'' I replied.
</P>
<P>
There is something nice about age lines, even about wrinkles. It's
sad that for so many women these are hated signs of aging that
translate in their minds into threats to their continued
attractiveness and, therefore, to their value.
</P>
<P>
Those wrinkles on the forehead are really frown lines caused by
deep thinking. Surely, there's nothing wrong with that. Those crinkles
at the edges of their eyes are either the result of smiling or of
squinting because they are too vain to wear their glasses. Both are
the result of living. A lived-in face is a warm and comforting thing.
</P>
<P>
This fixation some women have with aging and their appearance gets
in the way of their enjoying their progress through life.
</P>
<P>
``There's no one more invisible than a middle-aged woman,'' one
friend said to me.
</P>
<P>
It was fun to be an ingenue, but being 40-something has its value.
Most days.
</P>
<P>
I marvel at the things I've learned between my 20s and my 40s, the
people I've known, the children I've had, the jars of jam I've canned,
the stories I've written, the places I've been. Looked at that way,
those decades are achievement badges, the only kind life hands out. I
wouldn't want to go back. I know too much. Besides, there's too much
ahead to explore and experience.
</P>
<P>
Still, I hedge my bets. I apply eye cream faithfully, hoping it
will minimize the circles under my eyes. I wash away some of that
gray. Why not?
</P>
<P>
I figure I'm still holding the high ground because I refuse to lie
about my age. Of course, my friend Holly, loyal pal that she is, took
me out for my birthday and solemnly toasted my 39th -- once again. And
I have to admit it had a nice ring to it.

 RU-486 Q A: Answering Questions About French Abortion Drug 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This fall, some American women seeking an abortion will be offered
their first alternative to surgery: RU-486, the abortion drug widely
used in Europe and China.
</P>
<P>
The Population Council, a non-profit contraceptive research
organization in New York, holds the American patent rights to the
drug. It soon will select sites for clinical trials required by the
Food and Drug Administration before the drug can be made available to
the public. The Population Council expects approval in two years.
</P>
<P>
RU-486, manufactured by the French company Roussel Uclaf, is also
used outside the United States as a contraceptive ``morning after''
pill which prevents a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus
after unprotected sex. This usage of the drug is being tested now at
the University of California, San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
As an abortion drug, however, RU-486 will be tested in conjunction
with a prostaglandin pill; the RU-486, given first, makes the embryo
detach from the uterus while the other stimulates the body to expel
it. The treatment, given during the early weeks of pregnancy, is
painful and usually takes two to three days. A woman visits a doctor
several times over the course of treatment.
</P>
<P>
The benefits of using RU-486 include avoiding surgery and
anesthesia, permitting women to terminate pregnancy at an earlier
stage and affording them greater privacy. It allows women to obtain an
abortion from any physician who is trained in pregnancy and its
complications rather than requiring them to travel to centers where
surgical abortions are performed. Some women also believe this
non-invasive method gives them greater control over their bodies.
</P>
<P>
A surgical abortion, on the other hand, takes less time, is
slightly more effective -- 99 percent compared to 97 percent -- and
requires fewer office visits. In addition, women usually experience
less cramping and notice a lighter blood flow than they do with
RU-486.
</P>
<P>
The French manufacturer recommends women who are over age 35, who
are smokers and who have any other cardiovascular risks should not
take RU-486.
</P>
<P>
The Population Council will conduct its clinical tests on 2,000
women at as many as a dozen hospitals and clinics throughout the
country. Women seeking an abortion at these sites will be offered a
choice of RU-486 in lieu of surgery.
</P>
<P>
Until this new treatment becomes more widely used, misconceptions
may remain. Dr. George Huggins, chairman of the department of
obstetrics and gynecology at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, one
of the institutions applying to serve as a test site, recently
considered some basic questions about the drug.
</P>
<P>
Q: What is RU-486?
</P>
<P>
A: It's a compound that blocks the functioning of the progesterone
hormone. Progesterone is necessary for the maintenance of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
Q: Why is more than one pill necessary to cause an abortion?
</P>
<P>
A: Prostaglandins cause the uterus to contract and expel the
pregnancy. Most of the protocols today include giving prostaglandins
one or two days after RU-486.
</P>
<P>
Q: Must women always take prostaglandins in addition to RU-486?
</P>
<P>
A: If a woman just uses RU-486, the percentage completing the
pregnancy termination by themselves is somewhere between 65 and 85
percent.
</P>
<P>
Q: How long does it take to expel the embryo after taking the
prostaglandin pill?
</P>
<P>
A: Somewhere from six to 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
Q: How far into a pregnancy can a woman use this method?
</P>
<P>
A: Up to 54 days from the first day of her last menstrual period.
</P>
<P>
Q: What are the side effects?
</P>
<P>
A: There is a small incidence of prolonged bleeding of more than a
day or so. Because of the prostaglandins, a fair number of women get
nauseated, have diarrhea and headaches while they are going through
the abortion process.
</P>
<P>
Q: What should a woman expect to feel physically?
</P>
<P>
A: This is a medical abortion, not a heavy period. A woman will
have significant cramping and significant bleeding. It's painful
enough so that, in one study, 37 percent of the women needed to take
some kind of pain medication during the process.
</P>
<P>
Q: How much will this method cost?
</P>
<P>
A: I have no idea on cost yet.
</P>
<P>
Q: What are the benefits of RU-486 over surgical abortion?
</P>
<P>
A: In some countries, surgical abortions are very expensive. In
France and in England, the health system requires that abortions be
performed in hospitals and that patients stay overnight. That makes
this method much more convenient and less expensive.
</P>
<P>
The major advantage to this method is in the developing world where
many surgical abortions are not clean or are not done with good
equipment or the skill of the provider might not be of very high
caliber. This will be significantly safer for those women. But that's
not true in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately in the United States today, surgical termination of
early pregnancy is a very safe procedure and has a very low
complication rate. Some 90 percent of surgical abortions are done in
outpatient facilities and patients go home in a couple of hours.
</P>
<P>
This new procedure is going to be more time-consuming for the
patients than a surgical termination. From a standpoint of cost and
convenience, RU-486 is not going to have quite the same advantages as
it does elsewhere. ... I think it's going to be more complicated than
surgical termination.
</P>
<P>
Q: Who do you anticipate will seek this treatment if it becomes
available?
</P>
<P>
A: Most of the women seeking abortions in our (Hopkins Bayview)
population are single. In the country, most of the women seeking
abortions are married.
</P>
<P>
We have no idea who this is going to appeal to -- or even whether it
will appeal -- to any specific segment of the population.

 CLASSIC SOUNDS: Conductor Does Justice to Shotakovich's 8th Symphony 
 Shostakovich, Symphony No. 8 in C Minor (opus 65); ``Funeral and 
 Triumphal Prelude'' (opus 130); ``Novorossiisk Chimes,'' 
 performed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Vladimir Ashkenazy 
 conductor (London 436 736-2). 
 Shostakovich, Symphony No. 8, performed by the Berlin Philharmonic, 
 Semyon Bychkov conductor (Philips 432 090-2). 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Of Shostakovich's harrowing symphonies, No. 8 may be the greatest.
It used to be classified as the composer's response to the horrors of
World War II. But the piece was written as the Germans fled the Red
Army after their collapse at Stalingrad and it has been argued more
recently -- by Ashkenazy, among others -- that the Eighth is more
generally about the tragedy of life in a totalitarian system and is
filled with fears about the future.
</P>
<P>
Certainly, it is Ashkenazy's favorite among Shostakovich's 15
symphonies, and this latest release ranks as one of the finest
performances of the Eighth in modern sound. In fact, Ashkenazy's only
genuine rival may be the great recording by his friend, Bernard
Haitink, with the Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
The Russian-born conductor understands the context of this piece -- 
the brutally repressive realities of his homeland under Stalin and his
successors. And like Haitink, Ashkenazy is not intimidated by the
structural complexities of the symphony, which begin with a gigantic
and wrenching 25-minute adagio, continue with two savage but very
different scherzos and yet another painfully searching slow movement
and conclude with a strange fifth movement allegretto, which nearly
tears itself apart with raging crescendos only to end with exhausted
and otherworldly resignation.
</P>
<P>
Ashkenazy's approach eschews flash for architectural strength: He
holds the huge opening movement together, sustaining its tension and
building inexorably to its shattering climaxes. His interpretation of
the pitiless third movement toccata, with its remorselessly repeated
rhythmic figure, seems initially unexciting, but grows exhilaratingly
to screeching satirical heights. And his pacing of the final movement
is masterly, suggesting the ``all passion spent'' of Milton's tragic
``Samson Agonistes'' at the symphony's equivocal close.
</P>
<P>
Choosing between this recording (which includes two short, moving
tributes to Russia's war dead as fillers) and Haitink's is difficult.
The Dutch conductor's great Amsterdam players make Ashkenazy's
Londoners sound almost like a bunch of ragamuffins. But Shostakovich
can take the rough and ready better than other composers.
</P>
<P>
That is demonstrated by Bychkov's recording of the Eighth with what
may be the world's greatest orchestra. The beautiful,
polished-to-perfection playing of the Berliners is insufficient
recompense for a first movement that is insufficiently sustained, a
third movement marred by rhythmic mannerisms and a final one that
fails to solve the riddle of the coda.
</P>
<P>
The best available recording of this piece, however, remains the
1982 live performance (Philips) of what was then the Leningrad (and is
now the St. Petersburg) Philharmonic under Evgeny Mravinsky, to whom
the work was dedicated and who conducted its premiere.
</P>
<P>
The sound, while not great, is good, and the performance has a
ferocity and conviction unmatched by any other -- save the same
conductor's long out-of-print, 1950s recording, once available as an
LP on the MK label. That earlier performance will probably resurface

 HIMOWITZ ON COMPUTERS: Fax Modems Provide Two Ways To Transmit 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not long ago, fax modems were exotic, expensive, cutting-edge
technology. Today they're standard equipment on many home and small
business PC packages. In fact, it's hard to find a modem today that
doesn't have fax capabilities built in.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, many users who have fax modems ignore their fax
capabilities, passing up a handy, dual-purpose tool. Others buy fax
modems thinking that at $100 to $200, they're cheap substitutes for an
honest-to-goodness fax machine, which is not the case.
</P>
<P>
Most fax modems today have two functions. They can operate as
standard modems for normal communications. They can run as fast as
14,400 bits per second (bps). That's the equivalent of 1,440 text
characters a second, or enough to fill a computer screen in a second
and a half. You can still find cheap modems that offer standard
communications at only 2,400 bps, but the cost of high-speed
communication has come down so quickly that the increased performance
is well worth the extra money.
</P>
<P>
In addition to standard modem innards, fax modems have chips that
emulate the transmission and receive circuitry in standard fax
machines.
</P>
<P>
There's a big difference between the two types of communication,
even if they're packaged in the same modem case. Let's say you're
collaborating on a report or book with someone in another city. If
you're using the same word processing software, you can use a standard
modem to send the actual file you're working on. Your correspondent
can call up that document, make changes, and send it back.
</P>
<P>
When you fax a document, all you're sending is a picture, a
collection of dots that means something to you because your brain is
smart enough to turn them into words and numbers. But those dots mean
nothing to your word processor. Some high-end fax programs include
optical character recognition software that can turn those dots back
into usable text for your application programs, but the process is
tedious and inaccurate at best.
</P>
<P>
In facsimile mode, fax modems also differ from desktop fax machines
in the source of the images they send and the destination of the
images they receive.
</P>
<P>
A desktop fax machine actually has three parts. There's a scanner,
which converts documents into digital images; a telephone and
facsimile modem that transmits and receives those images, and a
printer that reproduces the image on paper. No matter how much you pay
for a fax machine, the basic technology inside is the same. That's why
different brands of fax machines can talk to one another without so
much as a hiccup.
</P>
<P>
Instead of scanning existing documents, fax modems get their images
from your computer. For IBM compatibles running older DOS programs,
this presents some difficulty. Memory-resident DOS fax programs chew
up memory, and because they lack font recognition technology, the
output on the other end often looks as though it came from a cheap
dot-matrix printer.
</P>
<P>
For PCs running Windows and for Apple Macintoshes, fax modems are
far more useful. That's because the fax software is installed as a
printer driver - a program that tells the computer's underlying
software how to communicate with a printer.
</P>
<P>
When you select the fax modem as your printer and print a document,
your software will typically pop up a screen asking you for the phone
number of the receiving fax, or allow you to choose the number from a
dialing directory. The program will dial the number and send the
document with no further intervention.
</P>
<P>
But there's a big difference at the other end; in fact a document
faxed directly will look like no other fax you've ever seen. Your
software essentially treats the receiving fax as a 200 dot-per-inch
printer. While it's not quite up to laser standards, your document
will come out with its fonts, graphics and logos sharp and intact. By
eliminating the middleman - the cheap scanners built into most fax
machines - your fax modem delivers remarkable quality.
</P>
<P>
This has made fax modems a favorite with travelers using laptop
computers. If you need a printed copy of a report stored on your PC,
all you have to do is fax yourself a copy at your hotel or business
destination.
</P>
<P>
Fax receiving software typically runs in the background, alerting
you when faxes come in. The faxes can be stored on your disk, viewed
on screen or printed. Some users like this because it saves trees.
They can throw away junk faxes before they're committed to paper.
</P>
<P>
Fax modems generally come with basic software to make them work
their magic, although more sophisticated fax programs provide more
flexibility. Elementary fax programs may let you do little more than
set up a phone directory of fax numbers, and that may be all you need.
More sophisticated programs will automatically send the cover page of
your choice, transmit a scanned signature at the end of your document
and allow you to set up groups of phone numbers for mass fax
broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
Now the downside. Not every document you'll want to fax will be
created on your computer. You may want to send a copy of a report from
another department, a magazine article, a drawing or diagram, or a
copy of Aunt Rhoda's chocolate cake recipe. The only way to do this
with your computer is to buy a full-page scanner -- at $700 to $1,500 -- 
and then master the scanning software.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, a fax modem is no substitute for a shared fax machine in
an office environment where many people need to send and receive
documents. And for those who receive faxes at odd hours, I question
the wisdom of leaving a $2,000 computer running around- the-clock to
save the expense of a $300 fax machine.
</P>
<P>
Even with these limitations, fax modems are good buys, particularly
for owners of Macintoshes or PCs running Microsoft Windows. While
they're not complete substitutes for regular fax machines, they're
convenient for sending documents created on your computer.

 Protect Estate and Heirs by Setting Up a Trust 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You didn't work hard all your life just for the IRS to claim a big
chunk of your savings after you die.
</P>
<P>
Instead, you want to make sure your estate will be distributed to
your heirs according to your wishes. That's where trusts can help.
</P>
<P>
But creating the right trust requires considerable planning and
some tough decision-making. Put bluntly, trust planning requires you
to mentally kill off every generation of your family, says Charles
Groppe, a partner at the law firm of Putney, Twombly, Hall Hirson in
New York. The idea is to imagine who would be the beneficiary of your
estate in different scenarios, depending on who dies first.
</P>
<P>
This macabre mental exercise can become especially complicated if
you have been married more than once and have children from one or
more of the marriages. Imagine that a husband wants to provide for his
new wife after he dies, but he also wants to be sure his children from
a first marriage receive some inheritance after she dies. If he
bequeaths his estate to his second wife, he has no assurance she will
include his children in her will.
</P>
<P>
The solution, says Lisa Berger, author of a book about retirement
planning called ``Feathering Your Nest,'' is a Qualified Terminable
Interest Property Trust, or QTIP.
</P>
<P>
The husband sets up a trust so that after he dies, his wife will
receive the income from the trust. He may even structure the trust so
she has access to some of the assets at the discretion of the trustee
who runs it. But she has no direct control over the trust assets.
After she dies, the remaining estate goes to the trust's beneficiaries
 -- in this case, the man's children by a first marriage.
</P>
<P>
A word of warning: Depending on where you reside, you may not be
able use a trust to prevent your surviving spouse from taking part of
your estate outright.
</P>
<P>
Trusts also can be useful if a father is worried that his children
will squander their inheritance, or if he wants to specify how the
inheritance can be used, such as for a college education. In that
case, the father can set up a trust that will provide income for his
children, but will be managed by a trustee according to his wishes.
</P>
<P>
Parents of a disabled child may want to create a trust to be sure
the child is adequately cared for after they die. If a trust is drawn
up correctly, it can help shelter assets so that the child can
continue to receive government aid. Karen Greenberg, a financial
planner in Baldwin, N.Y., who specializes in financial advice for
parents of disabled children, says that a special needs trust, or
Escher trust, is a means of ensuring the disabled person will qualify
for government benefits, while still receiving income and principal
from the trust for other ``quality of life'' items.
</P>
<P>
Trusts are also commonly used to reduce estate taxes. This is not
usually an important consideration unless you have an estate worth
more than $600,000 -- the threshold for federal estate taxes. That may
sound like a lot of money. But by the time you add together the
current value of your home, your pension plan, 401(k) plan, life
insurance policy and other savings, you may have a much larger estate
than you think.
</P>
<P>
You are allowed to deduct certain expenses from this total before
you arrive at the amount used for calculating federal estate tax. They
include such things as funeral expenses, income taxes owed, and other
bills that must be paid from the estate.
</P>
<P>
Don't forget that in addition to federal estate taxes you may have
to pay state estate taxes or inheritance taxes, or both. Five states
</P>
<P>
have no inheritance tax on the recipient but instead levy taxes on
the entire estate, Berger says. The state's threshold may be lower
than for federal tax.
</P>
<P>
The good news is that the IRS and most states allow an unlimited
marital deduction. That means no matter how large your estate, if you
bequeath it to your spouse, there will be no estate tax.
</P>
<P>
However, the tax bite comes after your spouse dies. Say for
example, your estate is worth $1.2 million. You leave it all to your
wife so there is no estate tax. When she dies, however, half of it
will be tax exempt and the other half will be subject to estate tax.
And that can add up to quite a bite. Groppe says that in New York, for
instance, the combined federal and state estate tax on $600,000 is
$240,000.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
In this scenario, there is a way to avoid getting hit with any
taxes. It's often referred to as a bypass trust or a credit shelter
trust. And it basically works this way: When the husband dies, he
leaves his wife $600,000 outright. And he puts $600,000 into a family
trust that will provide income for his wife as long as she lives. When
she dies, she bequeaths $600,000 tax-free to her heirs. And because
the trust is a separate entity, it can be passed on tax-free to the
designated beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
Be careful if you are considering bypassing your children and
giving your estate to your grandchildren, Groppe says. This may
trigger an additional generation-skipping tax. The government imposes
this tax because, in effect, you have deprived it of a generation's
worth of taxes. There is a $1 million exemption. But this is a
complicated area of the tax law, requiring professional advice.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
There are also a variety of irrevocable trusts that can effectively
shelter assets from estate taxes. For example, there are irrevocable
life insurance trusts. Some parents who don't want their children to
have to sell property or the family business to pay for estate taxes
set up insurance trusts. That way the policy can be passed tax-free to
the heirs, who then can use the cash to pay the estate tax bill. And
there are charitable remainder trusts, which are one of the few tax
shelters left because they can reduce your income tax while you're
alive.
</P>
<P>
The hitch with an irrevocable trust is that once you create one,
you can't change it.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Before you consult a lawyer or other professional about setting up
a trust, it's a good idea to educate yourself. Learn more about the
different kinds of trusts and carefully consider how they may fit your
goals. Martin Censor, a lawyer and senior editor at Warren Gorham
Lamont, a New York publishing company, says that most people could cut
the amount of time spent with a lawyer and save up to 50 percent in
professional fees if they prepare themselves first.
</P>
<P>
Finally, shop around for a good lawyer or financial adviser. Don't
be shy about interviewing several experts about their fees and
services. And, as Berger notes in her book, ``Be suspicious of an
attorney, financial planner or bank trust department that urges you to
completely turn over the reins to your estate by giving total power of
attorney.''

 Reality in the China Trade 
 The following editorial appeared in Wednesday's Baltimore Sun: 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the national interest, President Clinton must find a way out of
the trap he laid for himself in his executive order a year ago giving
China one year to improve human rights in order to retain most favored
nation (that is, ordinary) trading relations.
</P>
<P>
China is the world's emerging superpower. Removing MFN status would
mean raising tariffs about 40 percent, accepting retaliation, and
nullifying U.S. companies' opportunities in the world's greatest
growth market, including oil exploration and construction. The issue
is not about isolating China so much as isolating the United States.
</P>
<P>
China is a boisterous economy of regions out of control of central
direction. But China's central government is paranoid about disorder,
having experienced the lunacy of China's Cultural Revolution of the
1960s. Hence the crackdown on dissidents from 1989 -- a crackdown that
is unabated despite U.S. censure. China's Premier Li Peng will not
leap through hoops for the domestic agenda of Clinton. This, however,
does not lessen the need for the United States to engage China in
dialogue, knit it into the world community, encourage free enterprise
and free spirits. Exactly the opposite of what a trade war would do.
</P>
<P>
There is much the U.S. president can say from his bully pulpit
about human rights, both for imprisoned heroes of Tiananmen Square
and, more cogently, the culturally suppressed people of Tibet. Citizen
groups like Human Rights Watch should not muffle their agitation. But
pretending the U.S. government is a human rights referee who must be
obeyed, or that trade is a favor the U.S. bestows, is a fantasy this
nation can no longer afford.
</P>
<P>
Drawing away from still another example of untenable foreign-policy
posturing will be awkward for Clinton. But he can make the point that
under U.S. pressure China has halted exports made with prison labor
and has eased barriers to emigration -- the two specific conditions set
out in his executive order a year ago. He should reject a proposed
half-way measure banning goods made by state-owned enterprises,
including those of the People's Liberation Army. As Sun correspondent
Robert Benjamin has reported from Beijing, such a move would hurt the
U.S. as much or more than China. State firms were the major buyers of
$8.8 billion in U.S. export sales to China last year.
</P>
<P>
It is counter-productive for the United States to engage in a
gratuitous struggle of wills with a China whose cooperation is needed,
for example, in dealing with the North Korean nuclear threat or in
stopping its missile sales to South Asia and the Middle East. If trade
is to be an issue, let it concern Chinese pirating of U.S. patents and
copyrights or opening Chinese markets to U.S. competition.
</P>
<P>
What Clinton must come to terms with in his imminent executive
order is that he is shaping policy for years to come. The situation is
far too important for play-acting about the internal affairs China, or
for grandstanding that ignores real U.S. national interests.

<TEXT>
   ACE VENTURA: PET DETECTIVE (PG-13). Every body movement and facial
tic of Jim Carrey (of ``In Living Color'' fame) is so broadly
exaggerated here, he makes goofy Jim Varney look like stoic Charles
Bronson by comparison. A movie revolving around as manic a presence as
Carrey's sounds like it could be hell, but his starring debut proves
surprisingly capable of provoking unexpected giggle fits. The movie is
uneven, but his cartoonish inhumanness is nearly heroic.

   BABYFEVER. ``For those who hear their clock ticking....'' That
would be the entire audience after two unrelenting hours of
procreation talk. This filmic baby shower from women's best friend
Henry Jaglom is so packed with improvising actresses (there are
dozens) that it's a remarkably compleatist documentary on infant
morality in the '90s. But it's way too formless -- all the way to its
diapers-ex-machina ending -- to count much as drama. Jaglom's wife,
Victoria Foyt, is good enough in the lead to be the rare auteur 
spouse you actually want to see more of in a movie.

   BACKBEAT (R). Engaging, uneven movie about the early pre-Fab days
of the Beatles when Stu Sutcliffe and Pete Best were in the group and
Ringo wasn't. The film is basically about Stu's connection to the
group and his vehement friendship with John Lennon. Stephen Dorff
plays Stu, Ian Hart is excellent as Lennon.

   BAD GIRLS (R). Even cowgirls get the guns. This Western is
shamelessly high concept but sometimes enjoyable anyway. Andie
MacDowell, Mary Stuart Masterson, Drew Barrymore and Madeleine Stowe
play prostitutes who rampage with righteous fury while showing off the
latest designer fashions from the Old West. Stowe is remarkable, as
usual.

   BEING HUMAN (PG-13). Robin Williams stars for writer-director Bill
Forsyth (``Local Hero'') in a series of interwoven vignettes
concerning a character who travels through history searching for love,
self-worth and fulfillment. John Turturro also stars.

   BELLE EPOQUE (R). Fernando Trueba's Oscar-winning film captures a
sunny yet fleeting moment in 1932 Spain, an interlude of unconscious
freedom and joy as the monarchy fades and the republic is born. The
setting is a rural community dominated by the open-minded Don Manolo
(Fernando Fernan Gomez), whose four attractive daughters beguile a
handsome young army deserter (Juan Sanz).

   BEVERLY HILLS COP III (R). Eddie Murphy's back as Axel Foley. This
time he's lured to an amusement park with a criminal element. John
Landis directs; Judge Reinhold and Hector Elizondo co-star.

   BITTER MOON (R). Roman Polanski's carnal black comedy about an
obsessively masochistic couple, Peter Coyote and Emmanuelle Seigner,
and the British couple, Hugh Grant and Kristin Scott-Thomas, they
dragoon on a luxury cruise. Laughable and watchable.

   BRAINSCAN (R). Edward Furlong stars as a diffident teen-ager swept
up in a virtual reality game in which a series of murders may actually
be real. Scary, in a workmanlike way, but the film doesn't live up to
its full potential. With Frank Langella.

   CLEAN SLATE (PG-13). Dana Carvey plays a small-time gumshoe who
suffers from a rare form of amnesia that makes each morning when he
wakes a tabula rasa. Intermittently funny but flimsy. The premise far
better than the execution. Barkley the wonder dog shares comic honors
with Carvey.

   COPS AND ROBBERSONS (PG). Michael Ritchie's slyly subversive family
comedy in which Chevy Chase plays a suburbanite who thinks his big
chance to be a hero occurs when crusty cop Jack Palance uses his tract
house to stake out his villainous next door neighbor (Robert Davi).
Funny, inspired but with a tinge of sadness amid the laughter. With
Dianne Wiest as Chase's too-perfect wife.

   CROOKLYN (PG-13). Though the story of an African American family in
1970s Brooklyn is based in part on director-cowriter Spike Lee's own
experience growing up, the film that resulted, despite some moments of
emotional connection, is more aimless than involving. Good
performances by Alfre Woodard and Delroy Lindo don't really go
anywhere.

   The Crow (R). The only reason for a grown person to see this
hyper-violent doom-and-gloom comic strip adaptation is for the late
Brandon Lee's charismatic presence. As the murdered rock guitarist who
comes back to life for vengeance, Lee has a kinetic power. His
balletic rampages are like waking nightmares. Otherwise, this film
will probably be a hit with tortured male adolescents.

   D2 THE MIGHTY DUCKS (PG). A disappointing, overly contrived sequel
to the impressive and popular 1992 original. Once again an energetic
Emilio Estevez is coaching his peewee ice hockey team, but the first
film's clear concern for values gets badly muddled this time out.

   EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES (R). Making Tom Robbins' trendy novel
of virtuoso hitchhiker Sissy Hankshaw (Uma Thurman) and her oversized
thumbs into a movie was a questionable idea at best, but combining
writer-director Gus Van Sant's deadpan aesthetic of boredom with
Robbins' flimsy jokiness proves to be a recipe for disaster. Only k.d.
lang Ben Mink's fine score survives the wreckage.

   THE FAVOR (R). Pleasant romantic comedy starring Harley Jane Kozak
as a thirtysomething housewife who develops an itch for her high
school boy friend (Ken Wahl) as their 15th high school reunion
approaches -- and who comes up with the cockamamie idea that her
single, liberated best pal (Elizabeth McGovern) ought to scratch it
for her. With Bill Pullman, Brad Pitt.

   THE FLINTSTONES (PG). John Goodman dons a saber-toothed tiger suit
as Fred, with Rick Moranis as neighbor Barney Rubble. When Fred gets a
promotion at Slate Co. quarry, things really change for that modern
Stone Age family. Elizabeth Perkins, Rosie O'Donnell, Kyle MacLachlan,
Halle Berry and Elizabeth Taylor co-star. Brian Levant directs.

   FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL (R). A cheerful and witty bit of
business that belies its no-nonsense title, the latest from director
Mike Newell (``Enchanted April'') provides the kind of sly pleasure
typical of British comedy at its best. Hugh Grant stars as a
marriage-shy young man who keeps running into the very eligible Andie
MacDowell at wedding after wedding. A tasty romp that garnishes its
humor with style.

   HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN'S THUMBELINA (G). Animators Don Bluth and
Gary Goldman once again cast their spell so effectively that you don't
have to be a child to be swept away into its magical Never-Never Land,
where the diminutive Thumbelina hopes to find a Prince Charming her
size. Traditional in style yet imaginative, with lyrics by Jack
Feldman and Bruce Sussman and music by Barry Manilow. Adroit use of
such familiar voices as those of Carol Channing, Charo and John Hurt.

   THE HOUSE OF THE SPIRITS (R). A lumbering oaf of a movie that turns
Isabel Allende's best-selling novel of half a century of personal and
political turmoil in South America into an extended sleeping pill. Not
even the presence of a glittering cast, including Jeremy Irons, Meryl
Streep and Glenn Close, can overcome Bille August's misguided
direction.

   THE HUDSUCKER PROXY (PG). Those pristine perfectionists the Coen
brothers have done it again with a technically dazzling tribute to the
films of the 1940s that is more than a little cold around the heart.
Fine performances by Tim Robbins and Jennifer Jason Leigh and the best
art direction in the world can't break the frost.

   THE INKWELL (R). Widely unveven second film from ``Straight Out of
Brooklyn'' director Matty Rich, at once a heavyhanded,
way-over-the-top satire of the black bourgeoisie in the '70s and a
tender coming-of-age story. Set in an area of Martha's Vineyard called
the Inkwell, a black enclave since the turn of the century. Larenz
Tate stars.

   JIMMY HOLLYWOOD (R). This amusing look at the would-be actors of
the world is a return to small-scale, shambling humor by
writer-director Barry Levinson. Joe Pesci is clever and effective as
Jimmy Alto, convinced that the break he needs is just this far away,
but his engaging performance has to contend with a minimalist plot
that grandly bypasses plausibility.

   LITTLE BUDDHA (PG). Director Bernardo Bertolucci's latest combines
a modern story about Tibetan monks looking for their reincarnated
master with an idealized travelogue on the life of the Buddha and
comes up with the most elaborate and expensive After School Special
ever. Well suited for children, but, luscious images notwithstanding,
without enough nuance to captivate most adults.

   MAJOR LEAGUE II (PG). The inevitable sequel to the 1989 baseball
hit is a so-so clobber comedy with a few funny moments, most from Bob
Uecker as the play-by-play announcer of the laggard but pennant-bound
Cleveland Indians. Charlie Sheen, Dennis Haysbert, Tom Berenger and
others recap their roles from the first film.

   MAVERICK (PG). High-priced crowd-pleaser that reaches for Feel Good
and settles for Feel OK. Mel Gibson stars as Maverick, the spineless,
jaunty gambler first seen in the ABC TV series, and he's exhaustingly
sporty. Jodie Foster and James Garner co-star. The flimsy
facetiousness of this comedy places it somewhere between ``Butch
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'' and ``The Apple Dumpling Gang.''

   A MILLION TO JUAN (PG). Paul Rodriguez stars in and directed this
clunky sort-of comedy with socially conscious overtones. A poor
Mexican immigrant is mysteriously handed a check for a million
dollars. Based on a Mark Twain story that was also the basis for a
fine, neglected 1954 comedy starring Gregory Peck.

   MR. WRITE (PG-13). It's really ``Mr. Wrong,'' a stale, labored
romantic comedy about a nebbishy struggling playwright (Paul Reiser)
who falls for a beautiful woman (Jessica Tuck) he meets while
appearing in a candy commercial. With Martin Mull.

   MONKEY TROUBLE (PG). Harvey Keitel is the con artist who has taught
a darling little simian how to excel as a pickpocket. Thora Birch
later adopts the animal, and an wild adventure ensues when Keitel
attempts to retrieve his former partner in crime. Mimi Rogers
co-stars; Franco Amurri directs.

   NAKED GUN 33 1/3: THE FINAL INSULT (PG-13). The third in the
``Naked Gun'' series is not as funny as the first two but is still
chock-filled with good gags. Leslie Nielsen's Lt. Frank Drebin is
retired but not for long.

   NIGHT OF THE DEMONS II (R). Smart, sexy and amusing horror picture,
which finds students at a posh Catholic coed prep school surprised to
find themselves caught up for real in a struggle between the forces of
good and evil when they break into a spooky deserted old house on
Halloween Eve. With Jennifer Rhodes, Amelia Kinkade.

   NO ESCAPE (R). It's 2022 and prisoners too tough for maximum
security are airlifted to a peninsula called Absalom and left to fend
for themselves between warring jungle lords. Ray Liotta's Marine Capt.
John Robbins is the antihero convict who tries to survive in the
jungle. It's a no-brainer with some exciting action sequences and lots
of grunting, decapitating and gougings.

   ON DEADLY GROUND (R). Steven Seagal makes a lively if preachy
directorial debut starring as an oil rigger who discovers his
villainous employer (a deliciously nasty Michael Caine) is cutting
corners to the extent of endangering the environment. Although one
could wish Seagal had delivered his message with a less heavy hand, he
is on target in his sentiments and quite possibly will be reaching
audiences who never thought about the environment before.

   THE PAPER (R). This Ron Howard-directed ensemble piece about a day
in the life of a bustling New York City tabloid newspaper and its
quirky staff can be awfully funny when it chooses to be, but too much
of the time it is unwisely intent on showing the serious side of its
characters' lives. A lot of energetic acting from its cast, especially
Michael Keaton in the lead, does help. (Turan)

   PCU (PG-13). The spoofing of campus politics is haphazard and
directed mainly at feminists in this anemic venture whose real point
is to get down and party, but it comes across as a pale, passe carbon
of ``Animal House'' that's not half as much fun. With Chris Young,
Jeremy Piven, Jessica Walter.

   PHILADELPHIA (PG-13). Nothing is so fatal to effective drama as the
air of dogoodism that hangs over Hollywood's first attempt to deal
with the AIDS crisis. Tom Hanks plays a high-powered lawyer who feels
he's been fired because of the disease and Denzel Washington co-stars
as the initially homophobic attorney who takes his case. Not intended
to be subtle, with the good and bad guys clearly labeled, this is
mainstream socially conscious filmmaking that is not worried about
sacrificing nuance to make its points.

   THE PIANO (R). Using Holly Hunter and Harvey Keitel in ways never
seen before, writer-director Jane Campion has given a sweepingly
romantic 19th century tale an almost avant-garde edge. Telling the
story of Ada, a mute arranged bride who comes to primitive 1852 New
Zealand with her piano and powerfully affects the lives of Keitel and
Sam Neill, Campion shows herself to have a command of the visual and
the emotional that is fearless and profound. Winner of two prizes at
Cannes, and deservedly so. Won Academy Awards for original screenplay
(Campion), actress (Hunter) and supporting actress (Anna Paquin).

   REALITY BITES (PG-13). The most appealing film yet about the
nameless post-collegiate generation, this romantic comedy starring
Winona Ryder, Ethan Hawke and Ben Stiller (who makes his directing
debut) is cheerful, edgy and alive. A traditional triangle detailing
the rivalry for one woman's affection, it is turned by Helen
Childress' clever and clear-eyed script and Stiller's direction into a
natural and assured piece of business.

   SCHINDLER'S LIST (R). A most unlikely director, Steven Spielberg,
tells the quietly devastating story of the most unlikely of Holocaust
heroes, Oskar Schindler, a convivial sensualist, gambler and war
profiteer who rescued 1,100 Jews and ended up the only Nazi Party
member to be buried in Jerusalem's Mount Zion cemetary. Put together
with care, emotion and, most importantly, restraint, this is as good a
fiction film on the Holocaust as we are likely to get.

   SERIAL MOM (R). John Waters' latest black comedy is one of his
best. Kathleen Turner plays a spic-and-span housewife who is actually
an avenging mom. It's her best comic role since the neglected ``The
Man With Two Brains.''

   SIRENS (R). Silly, sexy romp about a stuffy reverend and his wife
who go on a religious mission to the mountain retreat of a pagan
painter and get taken in by the free-floating sensuality. Closer to
the Playboy Channel than D.H. Lawrence, and probably the better for
it. Hugh Grant and Sam Neill star, also Elle MacPherson, in the buff.

   SURVIVING THE GAME (R). A small group of hunters track human prey
(in the form of Ice-T) in the Pacific Northwest. What they'll
painfully learn is that their quarry will fashion his street smarts
into an effective method of retribution. Rutger Hauer and F. Murray
Abraham star; Ernest Dickerson directs.

   THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT! III (G). A showy tribute to that most
glorious -- and most indisputably extinct -- of Hollywood genres, the
glossy MGM musical. Though the introductions by aging stars leans too
heavily on canned banalities, the clips, especially behind-the-scene
footage and numbers cut from original productions, are lively and
invigorating.

   3 NINJAS KICK BACK (PG). Lively and imaginative sequel to the 1992
original. This time a Japanese American grandfather (Victor Wong)
finds he's competing with the growing lure of basebell as he continues
to instill his three grandsons with the skills and virtues of martial
arts, which nevertheless pay off when they're all caught up in an
adventure that takes them to Japan.

   THREESOME (R). Obnoxious comedy about three college roommates -- 
played by Lara Flynn Boyle, Josh Charles and Stephen Baldwin -- who
learn all about role-playing and sexual preference while carrying on
like overheated banshees. It's sitcom stuff with a carnal overlay.

   TRADING MOM (PG). Writer-director Tia Brelis makes a delightful
feature debut in bringing her mother's novel ``The Mommy Market'' to
the screen. It's a fantasy about three children who unexpectedly get
their wish to exchange their harried single mother (Sissy Spacek) for
a model of their own choice.

   WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN (R). Meg Ryan and Andry Garcia star as a
modern couple, as much in trouble as they are in love, coping with the
effects of her problem drinking. Though both actors work hard and do
affecting jobs, the film's overall artificiality, the way it piles on
woe upon woe, detracts from the honesty of their performances.

   WHITE FANG 2: MYTH OF THE WHITE WOLF (PG). That half-wolf, half-dog
supercanine is back with a new master (Scott Bairstow) in a
less-than-riveting, stultifyingly politically correct adventure
involving a starving Native American tribe.

   WIDOW'S PEAK (PG). Lovely piffle set in Ireland in the early '20s
and starring Natasha Richardson, Joan Plowright and Mia Farrow, all in
fine form. Scripted by Hugh Leonard and directed by John Irvin, it's a
whodunit trussed up as a domestic comedy.

   WITH HONORS (PG-13). Brendan Fraser plays a Harvard student who
reluctantly befriends a homeless man played by Joe Pesci. Too many
drippy life lessons, but Fraser and Pesci have some rapport and the
college scenes are at least more believable than the ones in
``Threesome.''

   YOU SO CRAZY (NC-17). Comic Martin Lawrence may be in-your-face
raunchy and scatological, an enthusiastic detailer of all kinds of
sexual situations, but this fluid and funny performance film shows he
is also a sure comic presence, an adept social commentator and a
promoter of values that can only be called mainstream.

 Saving for Retirement: Earlier the Start, the Better (Washn) 
 James K. Glassman writes regularly on financial affairs 
 for The Washington Post. 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a vision of Yuppie Hell, consider some retirement
figures that arrived in the mail the other day.
</P>
<P>
They show what happens to a nest egg of $500,000 after 11 years: It
disappears. In other words, if you retire at age 62, this rather
sizable nest egg runs out eight years before the actuarial die.
</P>
<P>
This predicament reminded me of a terrifying short story by
Somerset Maugham called ``The Lotus Eater.'' I'll get back to the
figures and what you can do about them shortly, but first the plot of
the story:
</P>
<P>
Thomas Wilson is a London bank manager, a widower who has worked
hard since he was 17. He saves his money and decides in 1898, at the
age of 35, that he will retire to the idyllic Italian island of Capri.
</P>
<P>
But he has only enough funds to purchase a 25-year annuity -- an
investment contract that guarantees him an income for a fixed period
and then runs out.
</P>
<P>
At that point, Wilson would be 60. What then? Considering the
prospect, Wilson tells the narrator: ``Don't you think after 25 years
of perfect happiness one ought to be satisfied to call it a day?''
</P>
<P>
In other words, if he's not dead at 60, Wilson plans to kill
himself. But when the time comes, his will fails. ``It was difficult
to know what to do with him. He had no money and no means of getting
any.'' So he survives in wretched poverty, living in a woodshed,
wandering the hills, bumming food. He dies at 66.
</P>
<P>
This is a pretty nasty little story, and certainly a modern-day
Thomas Wilson would have welfare or Social Security to fall back on.
But the truth is that to retire comfortably takes a much larger chunk
of money than most people realize.
</P>
<P>
Back to the retirement figures. The Smith Barney Shearson
Consulting Group, which compiled them, made these assumptions: A
couple wants to have $80,000 a year in income -- money not just for
necessities, but for travel and for funding the grandchildren's
college education.
</P>
<P>
Retiring at 62, the husband, the main earner, draws a fixed
$20,000-a-year company pension. The couple also receives about $10,000
in Social Security benefits, adjusted annually for inflation.
</P>
<P>
The Consulting Group assumes that inflation runs at 4 percent a
year, so the couple needs $82,400 in the second year to have $80,000
in purchasing power. The final assumption is that the nest egg's
investments will earn 7 percent a year after taxes.
</P>
<P>
Now, you can argue with some of these assumptions. Perhaps you
don't need $80,000. Perhaps you can earn more than 7 percent a year.
But then again, perhaps you don't have $20,000 coming in from a
pension or other sources.
</P>
<P>
What makes the numbers especially daunting for baby boomers is
this: The nest egg comprises $500,000 in today's dollars. If you're 44
years old and plan to retire at 62-and if inflation runs at 4 percent
for the next 18 years-then what you will need when you're ready to
retire in 2012 is not $500,000, but $1 million!
</P>
<P>
In 2012, it will take one million bucks to buy you those measly 11
years of Lotus Land at an annual purchasing power (in today's dollars)
of $80,000. After that, it's the Thomas Wilson routine.
</P>
<P>
Actually, $1 million is a good number to shoot for. If you can cut
your needs down to $40,000 instead of $80,000, then you'll avoid the
fate of Maugham's hero and eke out a retirement until you reach your
actuarial reckoning. But how to get to a million?
</P>
<P>
The best answer is to start early. Say you want to retire at 62. If
you can manage to sock away $5,000 a year in a tax-deferred account
that produces a 10 percent return, you'll have your million dollars-as
long as you start when you're 31. But if you wait until you're 41 to
begin, you'll have only $300,000. And if you start at age 51, you'll
have less than $100,000.
</P>
<P>
Also, if you begin early, you will be able to devote a higher
proportion of your portfolio to stocks, which produce a better return
than bonds and money market funds but which carry more risk.
</P>
<P>
While time is the greatest engine of investment growth,
tax-deferral runs a close second. Critics of our current system
believe that one reason the United States has such a low savings rate
 -- less than 5 percent, compared with 15 percent for Japan and 13
percent for Germany -- is that we penalize savers with taxes.
</P>
<P>
It's true that the nation would be well served if we brought back
the tax-deductibility of contributions to individual retirement
accounts. But, even in their current form, IRAs provide a great way to
shield your money from taxes as it accumulates.
</P>
<P>
For example, T. Rowe Price Associates calculates that if you invest
$2,000 a year in a taxable account that earns 9 percent a year, you'll
have $183,000 after 30 years. But in a tax-deferred account, you'll
accumulate $297,000 before taxes and $231,000 after taxes. (Both
scenarios assume a 28 percent tax bite.)
</P>
<P>
Even more interesting is how the IRA helps you while you're
distributing the proceeds during your retirement. Using the above
example and assuming you live to be 90, the IRA will provide you with
$19,200 in after-tax income a year for 25 years while the taxable
account will provide you with just $13,250 annually.
</P>
<P>
That's the good news. The bad news is that $19,200 won't be a whole
lot of money 60 years from now.
</P>
<P>
And there's more bad news. A survey by Merrill Lynch Co. last
year found baby boomers saving at about one-third the rate required
for a secure retirement. And then there are these sage words, written
by Laurence Kotlikoff, a Boston University economics professor and an
expert on savings:
</P>
<P>
``Compared with their parents, baby boomers can expect to . . rely
less on inheritances, receive less help from children, experience
slower real wage growth, face higher taxes and replace a smaller
fraction of their pre-retirement earnings with Social Security
retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
``Unless baby boomers change their saving habits and change them
quickly, they may experience much higher rates of poverty in their old
age than those currently observed among U.S. elderly.''
</P>
<P>
You don't want to end up like Thomas Wilson, do you? So start
saving.

 Split Means Reforms Likely to Be Modest (NY) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Clinton administration and financial regulators are
unsure how best to rein in the risky Wall Street trading instruments
called financial derivatives, according to high-level sources familiar
with discussions on the subject.
</P>
<P>
As a result, regulators are likely to tinker with a few small fixes
without making sweeping reforms. What consensus has emerged is largely
to jury-rig the existing structure. The modest list includes better
risk monitoring, more public disclosure and more complete examination
of dealers.
</P>
<P>
``I am afraid we need a financial crisis before Washington moves on
this,'' said one source. ``There is enormous opposition from Wall
Street.''
</P>
<P>
Some White House officials worry that the $12 trillion market in
derivatives poses a threat to the financial system and the U.S.
economy and want comprehensive controls placed on their trading.
</P>
<P>
Other senior policy makers are less sure of the risks and more
concerned that tighter regulation would push the booming business in
derivatives offshore without significantly reducing the threats to
U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
Given the split, major regulation, such as requiring big players to
pony up more money if they want to be active derivatives traders, are
longer-term options, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
At present, securities firms and insurance companies that have set
up businesses to deal in derivatives get no regulatory scrutiny; banks
that trade derivatives are more closely watched, primarily by the
Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
(OCC).
</P>
<P>
Congress' appetite for a legislative solution is not yet widely
shared within the administration or the regulatory world, sources say,
largely because they fear that Congress will go too far.
</P>
<P>
``Our primary hesitation,'' said Darcy Bradbury, deputy assistant
Treasury secretary for federal finance, ``is that we have not yet
exhausted our current regulatory authority. We may need legislation
down the road, but it is a bit premature.''
</P>
<P>
Financial derivatives, so named because their values derive from
such underlying securities as stocks, bonds, foreign exchange and
commodities, have become central to the global financial markets.
</P>
<P>
They are increasingly used by Wall Street and large U.S.
corporations seeking to make big, highly leveraged bets or to hedge
unwanted risks. U.S. banks and securities firms are the industry
leaders and derive huge profits from the business. But some U.S.
banks, brokerages, speculators, mutual funds and industrial companies
have taken derivative-related losses as interest rates changed
direction in recent months.
</P>
<P>
The General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, issued
a report on derivatives last week that spotted ``regulatory gaps'' and
called for aggressive reforms, some of which would require
legislation.
</P>
<P>
This week, the House subcommittee on Energy and Commerce chaired by
Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., hears from Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan, comptroller of the currency Eugene Ludwig and Securities
and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr.
</P>
<P>
Markey wants legislation to bring securities firms and insurance
companies that deal in derivatives under the same, albeit spotty,
regulatory scrutiny that U.S. banks get. Their derivatives affiliates
are now unregulated.
</P>
<P>
Frank Newman, undersecretary for domestic finance, said the
administration's interagency working group on financial markets is
assessing the extent of the risks tied to derivatives.
</P>
<P>
``We are not waiting around, but we are still in the process of
determining how much risk to the financial system there is,'' he said.
``Our concern is that something might go wrong and turn a moderate
problem into a bigger problem through the global interconnection of
modern financial instruments like derivatives. We need to know more
about that systemic risk,'' a process he expects to take months.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, a consensus has emerged on the reforms likely to
take place:
</P>
<P>
-- Buyers and sellers of derivatives will be forced to account for
these instruments in ways that accurately reflect the risks they
entail.
</P>
<P>
Levitt has made it clear to the Financial Accounting Standards
Board, a private group that is charged with determining acceptable
accounting procedures, that it soon must set new standards for
accounting for derivatives in financial reports. FASB has been
studying the issue for more than five years.
</P>
<P>
-- Public disclosure must get a lot better. Companies and Wall Street
firms that buy or sell derivatives disclose next to nothing about the
guts of their derivatives activities, the risks they represent or how
they manage the positions.
</P>
<P>
Both the Fed and the OCC recently have given out stricter
guidelines for examiners and banks that require the reporting of the
terms and conditions of derivative positions. The SEC also has begun
to query many publicly traded companies on their stakes in this
high-stakes game. Levitt has said, ``Disclosure and accounting are my
highest priorities.''
</P>
<P>
-- Major dealers and users of derivatives will be required to monitor
and limit their risks more. That means more money spent on independent
audits and computer systems and more attention paid by top executives
and directors.
</P>
<P>
Banking regulators already have pushed commercial banks to do this.
The SEC has yet to ask securities firms to make the same commitment,
but sources say it will.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the interagency working group is considering a
proposal to ``subject dealers to more stringent stress tests,''
according to one source.
</P>
<P>
In a stress test, a derivatives dealer uses computer models to see
how much money he could lose if the financial markets fall, interest
rates rise or if other dealers and customers renege on their
obligations to pay.
</P>
<P>
-- Dealers will be examined carefully to make sure that they do not
sell risky derivatives to unsophisticated customers. And mutual funds
that use derivatives to evade fund investment restrictions will be
examined by regulators to see whether they are fulfilling their
fiduciary duties to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
Off the agenda for now are new rules requiring that they keep more
money in reserve to cushion losses in the event of a steep drop in the
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
The SEC is in the early stages of reviewing out-of-date rules on
how much cash securities firms active in derivatives must have to
ensure their survival in a crisis.
</P>
<P>
``Capital standards must relate to a firm's ability to withstand
market volatility, shocks,'' said a senior government official. Higher
capital standards for banks have been the subject of international
regulatory discussion for years, but no decisions have been made. U.S.
banking regulators are unlikely to act alone.
</P>
<P>
``The question is, do we want to encourage the taking of derivative
positions with very little money down?'' said a source. ``What does
that mean for people's staying power in a panic?''

 Derivatives a Gamble He's Willing to Take (NY) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hedge fund partner Christopher Ramon Castroviejo is a
man with trading in his blood, who doesn't see why Washington
bureaucrats should fret so much about derivatives -- the complex
financial instruments that are his livelihood.
</P>
<P>
Castroviejo, 44, the managing partner of the small Parallax
Partners firm, uses derivatives to bet on the rise and fall in various
financial indexes, and that kind of trading has begun to draw the
attention of government regulators and legislators.
</P>
<P>
Traders like Castroviejo often operate on very thin margins-putting
up very little money with the chance of making huge profits. But in
some cases lately the losses from such deals have been great, and
government officials wonder if the rules permitting such gambles
should be changed.
</P>
<P>
Castroviejo, whose grandfather became famous for betting that the
stock market was going to fall in 1929 and 1930, does not think so.
The tale of one of his derivatives deals in early February, in which
he made $188,432.78, provides an example of what he means, and why he
thinks derivatives are a splendid and relatively safe way of keeping
the economy going by injecting money into the markets.
</P>
<P>
It was quite early the morning of Feb. 2 that he left his cozy East
Side Manhattan house and his faithful Norwich terrier, Uptick. When he
reached his Park Avenue office, he discovered that one of his favorite
market indexes was just where he wanted it.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times Stock Exchange index (FTSE, usually pronounced
``footsie''), a measure of 100 British stocks, had been sliding
leisurely upward to a point where Castroviejo, who specializes in such
things, thought it was about to change direction. What should he do?
</P>
<P>
The chart of the FTSE's movement and other data compiled by
Castroviejo's quantitative analyst, a young Venezuelan mathematics
wizard named Luis Sanchez, indicated the index was exhausted and
unlikely to go much higher. Castroviejo wanted to bet that it would
fall, and Merrill Lynch Co. was offering him an option that would
allow him to see if he was right, and on terms too good to pass up.
</P>
<P>
For just $157,487 Castroviejo could buy a put option contract
valued at $7.5 million, essentially putting up only 2.1 percent of the
total in hopes that the market would turn just enough in the desired
downward direction that he could sell and make a profit. The farther
the index sank, the more money he would make.
</P>
<P>
He has been managing his own fund for little more than a year and
has kept much of the money in money market accounts and other secure
investments to establish a track record for caution. This worked
particularly well in the first quarter of this year, when the suddenly
volatile stock and bond markets forced losses on other managers while
Castroviejo's fund stayed in the black, if barely.
</P>
<P>
Investing has been a passion since he was 6 years old and heard his
grandfather, Bernard E. Smith, discuss a purchase of 10,000 shares.
The boy thought the financier had ordered 10,000 chairs, and wondered
out loud how they would all fit even in that huge house.
</P>
<P>
Smith had been born poor in the Hell's Kitchen section of New York
but began to work in brokerage firms and organize bear pools -- to bet
on stock market declines. His nickname was ``Sell 'Em Ben,'' based on
his legendary advice to ``Sell 'em all! They're not worth anything!''
as stocks collapsed in 1929.
</P>
<P>
Castroviejo got only Bs in economics at Harvard. His fondness for
the untrammeled marketplace seemed to distress professors who admired
the Soviet Union and other managed economies. But he did well on Wall
Street and now finds each day, either up or down, a joy.
</P>
<P>
``It's astounding to me that supposedly grown men are paid to do
this,'' Castroviejo said. ``It's wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
In the FTSE deal, his instincts proved correct. The index began to
descend and five days later he pulled out with a 119.65 percent return
on his cash investment. With mounting dismay he then watched as the
FTSE continued to go down, and down, and down some more.

``If I had just left it alone I hate to think what I would have
made,'' Castroviejo said. Still, he said, ``I like to sleep at
night.'' And he cannot see how any federal bureaucrat would think he
was doing any harm.
</P>
<P>
Derivative contracts, Castroviejo said, do well. In mortgage-backed
securities, he said, they ``remove the risk from the commercial bank
so a homeowner will be paying 1 to 1.5 percent less on his mortgage.''
Among derivative traders, ``there will always be the occasional bozo
who screws himself up,'' Castroviejo said, but overall the instruments
draw much more money into the markets. The more money is there, he
said, betting both sides of the wager, the more likely are markets to
be healthy and liquid and stable.

<P>
``There is plenty of money to be made in this game without being a
cowboy,'' he said.

 Promises Clinton Kept (Washn) 
 Soderberg is staff director of the National Security Council. 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the post-Cold War era, there is room for
disagreement about what America's foreign policy should be as we chart
our way through unexplored waters. But the criticisms gaining
popularity among some commentators that President Clinton has betrayed
his foreign policy commitments not only skew this debate but also are
flat wrong.
</P>
<P>
As the foreign policy aide with Bill Clinton in Little Rock during
the campaign and transition, I know what candidate Clinton said and
what he did not say. It was Bill Clinton who repeatedly pushed me and
his other advisers to reject promises he could not keep or that would
be inconsistent with sound long-term policies. Let's examine the
record:
</P>
<P>
-- Bosnia:
</P>
<P>
In July 1992, candidate Clinton called for tightening and enforcing
the sanctions, taking steps to charge the Milosevic regime with crimes
against humanity and having the United States take the lead in seeking
U.N. Security Council authorization for air strikes against those
attacking the relief effort, with the United States lending
``appropriate military support.'' In subsequent statements, he also
stated that he thought lifting the arms embargo against Bosnia should
be debated and that the United States should not permit ground troops
to become involved in the quaqmire.
</P>
<P>
All these statements are now administration policy. More progress
must be made. But American leadership has made a difference in
enforcing the sanctions and no-fly zones, sustaining the longest
airlift in history, protecting U.N. forces with NATO air power,
pressing for a war crimes tribunal and concluding the Muslim-Croat
agreement.
</P>
<P>
-- Somalia:
</P>
<P>
President-elect Clinton supported President Bush's decision to send
25,000 troops to Somalia. We were there longer and the costs were far
higher than predicted. But President Clinton brought the last of these
troops home on March 31. Their mission saved countless lives and gave
the Somali people a chance at peace.
</P>
<P>
-- Haiti:
</P>
<P>
Candidate Clinton sharply criticized the Bush administration's
policy of returning Haitians ``without a fair hearing for political
asylum.'' When the president-elect was presented with reports of an
impending massive exodus of Haitians, he called for a temporary
extension of that policy, coupled with a determined effort to work
hard for President Aristide's return. He also took steps that led to a
tenfold increase in the processing and approving of refugee applicants
at centers inside Haiti.
</P>
<P>
President-elect Clinton said he would change that policy ``when I
am fully confident I can do so in a way that does not contribute to a
humanitarian tragedy.'' On May 8, 1994, following reports of increased
human rights abuses in Haiti, President Clinton established a process
that affords all migrants a chance to make their case for asylum,
while this country continues to interdict Haitian migrants at sea.
</P>
<P>
-- China: Candidate Clinton criticized President Bush for
unconditionally renewing MFN and said the Chinese government should
make ``concrete and significant progress in the areas of human rights,
trade and nonproliferation in order to maintain its beneficial trade
status.'' Last year, President Clinton issued an executive order
conditioning MFN on significant, overall progress in human rights by
the Chinese government, resolving a bitter dispute with Congress and
setting forth reasonable steps the Chinese must take to maintain MFN.
We have also pressed China separately and vigorously on
nonproliferation and trade issues.
</P>
<P>
-- Middle East:
</P>
<P>
Having pledged in his campaign to ensure the United States serves
as a catalyst and an honest broker in building peace in the Mideast,
President Clinton has made that goal a high priority. The results are
impressive. Not only have two mortal enemies shaken hands on the South
Lawn of the White House but also the parties are implementing peace in
Gaza and Jericho.
</P>
<P>
-- Russia:
</P>
<P>
Candidate Clinton, on April 1, 1992, urged President Bush to lend
support to the reform efforts of President Yeltsin. Since taking
office, President Clinton has worked tirelessly in support of our
vital national security interests in Russia and successfully mobilized
a historic $4.1 billion in aid in support of democracy and reform.
</P>
<P>
-- Trade:
</P>
<P>
Candidate Clinton, despite strong opposition within his own party,
endorsed NAFTA and promised to address its deficiencies, notably in
the areas of environment, labor and import surges. As president, he
spearheaded the successful against-the-odds drive to enact NAFTA and
achieved the necessary side agreements. President Clinton also
followed through on his campaign commitment to ``strongly support
free, fair, open and expanding trade, including the GATT
negotiations.'' A historic GATT agreement was completed after seven
years of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
-- Arms Control:
</P>
<P>
Candidate Clinton pledged to strengthen the International Atomic
Energy Agency, the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and the Missile
Technology Control Regime and take the lead in negotiating a
comprehensive test ban treaty through a phased approach. All those
promises have been kept.
</P>
<P>
In the end, the president's record should be judged in terms of
whether he has strengthened the three pillars of our post-Cold War
foreign policy: promoting democracy, economic prosperity and strong
defense adapted to the new security environment. He is meeting that
test.

 ``Cop III'': Falling on a Triple Axel 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In ``Beverly Hills Cop III,'' Eddie Murphy -- the man
with the CinemaScope grin -- once again mugs, jives and drives his way
through the 90210 zone of boutiques, babes and bad guys. With
screenwriter Steven E. (``48 Hrs.'') de Souza at the word processor
and John (``Trading Places'') Landis in the director's chair, Murphy
is clearly in familiar company as they all embark on his goofy vanity
project.
</P>
<P>
But de Souza's script -- in which Axel Foley (Murphy) searches a
California amusement park to find the man who killed his police chief
(Gil Hill) -- is an uninspired, long-winded we-know-whodunit. Although
Landis' comic routines provide occasional relief, they're tired
reprises from previous ``Cop'' films. And as Foley reunites with his
unbearably gushy friends, L.A. cop Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) and
mop-topped Serge (Bronson Pinchot), the humor becomes as fatigued as
that other dismal Murphy sequel, ``Another 48 Hrs.''
</P>
<P>
``Beverly Hills Cop III'' is rated R for language and violence.

 Bertolucci's `Buddha': Spiritual Glow 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's hardly surprising that Bernardo Bertolucci -- a man undaunted
by the risky, the intellectual and the spectacular -- would make a film
about the Buddha. What is surprising is the beguiling, unpretentious
result: ``Little Buddha,'' a modern fable about a Seattle boy believed
to be a reincarnated Buddhist teacher, endears the audience to the
Tibetan doctrine with a glowing, almost Disneyesque panache.
</P>
<P>
Photographed gorgeously by cinematographer Vittorio Storaro,
``Little Buddha'' is graced with sweet-natured lamas, stunning sights
from the Himalayas and -- in the wackiest bit of casting since George
Burns played God -- Keanu Reeves as the Buddha. Few will believe this
without seeing for themselves, but Reeves is rather charming in the
role.
</P>
<P>
Bertolucci intermixes high art with childlike wonder, blatant
special effects with tacit spirituality. The movie, which also stars
Bridget Fonda and Chris Isaak, may initially seem superficial and
commercially pandering, like something Steven Spielberg would have
conceived. But it is remarkably devoid of cloying sentimentality. As
someone once said about the films of Max Ophuls, ``Little Buddha'' is
only superficially superficial.
</P>
<P>
In Seattle, schoolteacher Lisa Konrad (Fonda) is visited at her
home by a grinning, befrocked group of lamas. The leader, Lama Norbu
(Ying Ruocheng), who has journeyed all the way from Bhutan, informs
Konrad that her 9-year-old son Jesse (Alex Wiesendanger) may be the
reincarnated spirit of Lama Dorje, the Tibetan priest's teacher.
</P>
<P>
Lisa listens to Norbu with indulgent interest, but remains dubious.
Her architect husband, Dean (Isaak), is even more skeptical. But
little Jesse takes to the idea with chirpy enthusiasm. He becomes a
regular fixture at the Tibetans' local center. When Norbu gives him a
bedtime picture book about Buddha, the boy is spellbound.
</P>
<P>
As Jesse learns about the life of Prince Siddhartha, the founder of
Buddhism, the movie flits back 2,500 years to mythical India. In a
stirring fusion of past and present, ``Little Buddha'' relates
Buddha's evolution from spoiled prince to serene being and-in the 20th
century-details Norbu's quest to authenticate Jesse's potential link
to Lama Dorje.
</P>
<P>
It turns out that there are two other candidates (in Asia) for the
teacher's reincarnation, requiring Jesse to travel to Bhutan. The
child's fate is furthered when Dean -- whose business partner suffers
an untimely death -- finds himself suddenly responsive to matters of
the afterlife. While Lisa remains reluctantly in Seattle, father and
son embark on an unforgettable spiritual journey. Rather than delve
into the elusive depths of Buddhism, scriptwriters Mark Peploe and
Rudy Wurlitzer (adapting an original story by Bertolucci) chart a
paper-boat voyage over its surface. ``Little Buddha'' succeeds
precisely because of its guileless innocence: It even begins with the
words ``Once upon a time ...'' as Lama Norbu tells a goat fable to his
monastic students.
</P>
<P>
Storaro, possibly the world's greatest cinematographer, bathes the
modern and ancient Buddhist scenes in burnished reds and golds. In
America, he all but freezes Seattle in beautiful but icy blues. The
divide between East and West couldn't be visually clearer.
</P>
<P>
Bertolucci, who completes what he has dubbed his ``Oriental
trilogy'' here (with ``The Last Emperor'' and ``The Sheltering Sky''),
is hardly subtle about this duality. America's empty, cold materialism
is pitted against the warm splendor of Buddhism in a no-contest bout.
To this end, Bertolucci has directed Fonda and Isaak to give the most
lobotomized performances of their careers. But this bias is a minor
shortcoming, especially in light of Bertolucci's multiple embrace -- of
the American child who comes of age, the Western father who
experiences his own minor revelations, the monks who resolve their
compelling mystery and, of course, the great spiritual leader himself.
</P>
<P>
``Little Buddha'' is rated PG.

 Competition for Capitol Hill's `Roll Call' (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Capitol Hill, a political beehive already swarming
with reporters, is about to become a two-newspaper community.
</P>
<P>
New York publisher Jerry Finkelstein, whose company owns the
National Law Journal and more than 20 community papers in the New York
area, is launching a weekly newspaper devoted to covering Congress. He
has tapped veteran Hill reporter Martin Tolchin, who is retiring from
the New York Times after 40 years, as publisher and editor.
</P>
<P>
The still-nameless publication, scheduled to debut in September,
will mount a frontal assault on Roll Call, the twice-weekly paper that
has been required reading on the Hill since 1955.
</P>
<P>
``We're going to try to be a little more substantive and a little
more stylish than Roll Call,'' Tolchin says. ``We'll try to be
wittier, more audacious, and we'll try to have a soul, which I don't
think Roll Call does.''
</P>
<P>
Roll Call, which was purchased last year by the Economist of
London, says it isn't worried about the competition. ``We have a
unique niche: We cover Congress as an institution,'' says Editor Stacy
Mason. ``We cover the people, the politics, the neighborhood, the
police department, the post office, and that's why we're able to break
stories like the House Bank scandal.''
</P>
<P>
Finkelstein, 78, is a Democratic Party activist whose son, Andrew
Stein, was New York City Council president. Finkelstein consulted with
his old public relations partner, Times columnist William Safire,
about the Hill venture. ``He asked me who I thought would be a great
editor, and the first thought that leaped to mind was Marty Tolchin,''
Safire says.
</P>
<P>
Tolchin, 65, who has won the Everett Dirksen Award for
congressional reporting, plans to hire 24 mostly young reporters and
emphasize investigative reporting. Big newspapers, he says, ``tend to
do the stories du jour-welfare reform, health care. But there's a
whole lot that goes on there that is absolutely, totally uncovered.
There are a zillion things happening up there.''
</P>
<P>
Tolchin noted that Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., is a major
stockholder in the firm, News Communications Inc., but says
Finkelstein has promised him ``full editorial control.''
</P>
<P>
Capitol Hill is increasingly seen as an advertising bonanza as more
companies and lobbying groups try to influence lawmakers and their
staffs. Roll Call, which gives away more than two-thirds of its 15,000
copies, urges advertisers to ``send your message to Congress in Roll
Call.''
</P>
<P>
Finkelstein says his firm is investing several million dollars.
``You never know in business, but my instincts are usually right. I
think it's an untapped market,'' he says. But, he adds, ``I don't know
Washington at all. It's Marty's show.''
</P>
<P>
Robert Merry, Congressional Quarterly's executive editor, is more
skeptical: ``It's a marvelous little market, as Roll Call has proved,
but I have to wonder whether the market is big enough for two
players.''

 An Unstylish Fate (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The New York Times has discovered that it's hard to be hip.
</P>
<P>
Styles of the Times, the paper's two-year-old attempt to plug into
the youth culture, is losing its separate Sunday perch and will be
folded inside the Metro section. This will bring Styles both
production savings and later deadlines, but means the section front
can no longer be printed in color.
</P>
<P>
Styles, which has been through four editors in its brief existence,
has struggled to find an identity while exploring the world of
downtown parties, haute fashion and pop culture. Consciously pitched
to twentysomething readers, its features have ranged from ``The Arm
Fetish'' to Barney the dinosaur, from Hugh Hefner to John McEnroe's
SoHo gallery.
</P>
<P>
``Baysie Wightman is a woman in search of hip feet,'' a Styles
story began Sunday. ``She often finds them in the clubs of New York,
Tokyo and London, in the rock-and-roll bars of Seattle and Portland
... . ''
</P>
<P>
``It just never jelled,'' says James Ledbetter, the Village Voice
media columnist. ``The Times never knew what it wanted out of the
section. Some of the things it covered -- homosexual lifestyles, street
culture -- made people at the top of the corporation uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
``We remain committed to presenting lifestyle news, which has a
very loyal following,'' Publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. said in a
statement. An editor in the Styles section said the staff was ``under
orders'' to refer all calls to the PR department.
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Nancy Nielsen says such features as ``The Night,''
``Thing'' and ``Surfacing'' will be dropped. She says production costs
are ``the overriding factor'' in downgrading Styles, and denies that
the paper has failed at being hip.
</P>
<P>
``I know a lot of hip people who read the Times,'' she says.

 Russia Proposing Broader Talks With NATO (Brussels) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BRUSSELS, Belgium
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Russia proposed Wednesday beginning broad talks
with NATO on a wide range of issues, from nuclear proliferation to the
environment -- beyond its latest decision to join the Partnership for
Peace program.
</P>
<P>
The plan, unveiled at a NATO-sponsored meeting by Russian Defense
Minister Pavel S. Grachev, appeared to be aimed partly at domestic
consumption, to show hard-liners at home that Russia is still holding
its own in dealing with the West.
</P>
<P>
Grachev did not make his proposal a condition for Russia joining
the Partnership for Peace program, which was set up by the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization five months ago to provide an opportunity
for closer links with former East Bloc countries.
</P>
<P>
The Russians, who submitted their preliminary application for the
program Tuesday, still are expected to join formally as early as June,
at a meeting of NATO foreign ministers scheduled to be held in
Istanbul, Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Even so, the Western response to Grachev was lukewarm at best.
Although the NATO defense ministers seemed relieved that Russia had
not set conditions for its entry into the program, they seemed cool to
the notion of broader talks.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William J. Perry, when asked about the plan
at a news conference later, said only that what Grachev was proposing
was ``set up along different parameters'' than the Partnership for
Peace program.
</P>
<P>
He declined to comment on the substance of the request.
</P>
<P>
Western officials said they still are not sure just how NATO would
respond to the proposal. Besides proliferation and the environment,
Grachev listed defense conversion and disarmament as possible topics
in any broader talks.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's session marked the first time that the NATO defense
ministers and their counterparts from those countries in the
Partnership for Peace program have met as a group. So far, 18
governments, representing east European and ex-Soviet countries, have
signed up. Russia, assuming that it acts on its intention to join next
month, would be the 19th.
</P>
<P>
Perry, noting that for most of its existence NATO had been devoted
to defending the West against the now-defunct Warsaw Pact, called
Tuesday's session ``a major step in removing the dividing line between
East and West.''
</P>
<P>
Although Russia submitted its initial ``protocol'' Tuesday, Western
defense ministers seemed encouraged that Grachev himself attended the
entire Brussels meeting. The group later went to Mons, Belgium, to
tour a new Partnership for Peace center.
</P>
<P>
Until this week, Western officials had feared that Russia might
seek some sort of special status as a condition for joining the
program -- leading to worries among some east Europeans that it was
trying to dominate the group. But Grachev made it clear Wednesday that
Moscow would not press such demands as a condition for membership in
the program.
</P>
<P>
``We are not setting any preconditions for joining,'' he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that as part of its new role in the Partnership
for Peace program, Russia would be willing to join NATO forces in a
wide variety of operations, from peacekeeping duties to joint military
exercises.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
In that connection, the United States and Russia announced Tuesday
that they will go ahead with previous plans to hold joint military
exercises this summer, despite indications earlier that they might be
canceled.
</P>
<P>
In outlining his proposal for broader consultations between Russia
and NATO, Grachev argued that existing talks are proving inadequate
for the job, and that Russia and the West need a new vehicle for
widening their current agenda.
</P>
<P>
While praising the Partnership for Peace program as a ``first
step'' in bringing the two sides closer, he said it was ``not the
complete answer to the reality of the new epoch.''
</P>
<P>
``Russia is prepared for the creation of a real and full strategic
partnership with NATO,'' Grachev declared. He called his plan ``a
practical step on the road to the formation of a system of collective
security.''
</P>
<P>
Although Grachev's proposal for broader talks was not likely to
upset existing Western diplomatic machinery, analysts said it has the
potential to turn NATO into a political forum well beyond its historic
role as a military alliance.

 Novelist -- and Onetime Candidate -- Mario Vargas Llosa (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pretend for a moment that Michael Dukakis took off for
Zurich three days after he lost the '88 election. Suppose he announced
he was going to become a Swiss citizen. Imagine further Dukakis saying
the policies of the newly elected George Bush disgusted him, and that
other nations should impose sanctions against the United States.
</P>
<P>
Improbable as such a scenario might sound, it nevertheless strongly
resembles the behavior of Mario Vargas Llosa. The novelist ran for the
presidency of Peru in 1990 as a reluctant savior, the outsider who
would rescue the country from terrorism, bankruptcy and despair.
</P>
<P>
``I thought you could do politics differently,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
But politics proved inflexible, and nasty to boot. Vargas Llosa was
viewed as too rich, too white and too elitist in a country where the
electorate is overwhelmingly poor and dark.
</P>
<P>
``I was a complete failure,'' confesses the writer, who won only a
third of the vote. ``The election culminated in a new dictatorship in
Peru. It's grotesque.''
</P>
<P>
Vargas Llosa is now in exile. He spent the spring teaching at
Georgetown University here, trying to show students that literature is
``intimately related to life.''
</P>
<P>
It's certainly true in his case. Rarely do literature and life
become so closely interwoven. Vargas Llosa's novels and journalism
brought him to the brink of the presidency, but probably prevented him
from winning it.
</P>
<P>
In a sense, literature betrayed him. Novels may explain and reflect
and enhance life, but ultimately they're much simpler to control -- 
especially if you're the one writing them. The real world, on the
other hand, fights back. Now that he's learned his lesson, Vargas
Llosa doesn't want to be president of Peru anymore. Sometimes it seems
he doesn't even want to be Peruvian. ``I may return to Peru, I may
not,'' he says. ``But not in the immediate future, that's for sure.''
Not, in other words, while Alberto Fujimori -- professor turned
president turned strongman -- wields dictatorial control.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Vargas Llosa is campaigning for a cutoff of all
forms of foreign aid except humanitarian, saying rights abuses in Peru
demand drastic action. This has cost him some of his remaining friends
in the country. Others were dismayed when he asked Spain last year for
dual citizenship, a step he says he was forced to take after
harassment and threats by the Peruvian military.
</P>
<P>
Says the novelist: ``I don't know if I'm the most hated person in
Peru. I think Fujimori's more hated than myself.''
</P>
<P>
His wife, Patricia, isn't so sure. ``I'd have to see the polls,''
she says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
In his autobiography, just issued here as ``A Fish in the Water,''
the writer admits: ``Perhaps saying that I love my country is not
true. I often loathe it.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The youngest of the so-called ``Boom'' writers to emerge from Latin
America into international prominence during the '60s, Vargas Llosa,
now 58, is one of the few to reject the fantastical style of magic
realism. His masterpiece, the 1981 epic ``The War of the End of the
World'' -- based on a 19th-century uprising in northern Brazil -- is as
solidly built as anything by Stendhal or Tolstoy, the masters with
which it deserves comparison.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all his other fiction is set in Peru. ``Aunt Julia and the
Scriptwriter'' is a marvelous comic tale of a young man married to his
aunt (at 19, Vargas Llosa wed 32-year-old Julia Urquidi, his uncle's
wife's sister. They were divorced nine years later).
</P>
<P>
These books and many others, plus countless articles, were written
during a period of self-imposed exile that began in 1958, when the
writer received a scholarship to study in Madrid, and lasted for most
of the next three decades. But if exile, as Paredes Castro says, is a
defining characteristic of the greatest Peruvian intellectuals, it
doesn't fit into the basic resume of politicians -- in Peru or anywhere
else.
</P>
<P>
Compounding his troubles as a candidate was his political identity.
Just as he's one of the few realists among Latin American writers,
he's also one of the few who are not leftists. To his enemies, this
usually gets translated into: He's not a democrat.
</P>
<P>
``If you're a Latin American writer,'' Vargas Llosa complains,
``you're immediately labeled. If you're not a revolutionary, you're a
reactionary.''
</P>
<P>
Ronald Wright, a Canadian who has written extensively about Peru,
is one of Vargas Llosa's most caustic critics. ``He either was running
as an ego trip, or he was trying to gain material to write about.''
Wright cites an anti-Vargas Llosa slogan he saw emblazoned on a wall
during the campaign: ``Peru is not a novel.''
</P>
<P>
Even the writer's wife has questioned his intentions. She once told
her husband he was drawn to the presidency less for idealistic reasons
than by the prospect of ``writing the great novel in real life.''
</P>
<P>
There you have it: isolated by his artistic temperament, alienated
from the left, full of the sort of despair and yearning for his
country that politicians learn never to express, and criticized for
impure motives. The surprise isn't his failure to be elected; it's
that he got, in the end, 34 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori instituted financial reforms, but in April 1992 he closed
the Congress and the courts and suspended the constitution. The fact
that these actions have been generally popular hasn't changed Vargas
Llosa's mind. His basic argument: Destroying democracy in order to
improve the welfare of the people is a horrible idea.
</P>
<P>
``What is happening now in Peru is that you have economic reforms,
which are good, and at the same time you have monstrous crimes,
terrible abuses in human rights,'' he says, specifically referring to
the abduction of nine students and a teacher in July 1992. Suspected
of being collaborators with the Shining Path terrorists, all 10 were
shot in the back of the head, their bodies thrown into an unmarked
grave.
</P>
<P>
Anne Manuel, acting director of Human Rights Watch/Americas,
confirms that ``the situation in Peru after Fujimori's self-imposed
coup has worsened dramatically. Hundreds of people are being accused
of terrorism and imprisoned for life based on little or no evidence.''
</P>
<P>
``Torture without inflation? That's what we want for Latin America?
Human rights crimes with open markets? We have the right to demand
from Latin America the same standards that the United States expects
from its own society and its own politicians.''
</P>
<P>
Maybe, for his sake, it's better he lost. He's told that everyone
interviewed for this story, no matter how withering his opinion of
Vargas Llosa personally or politically, said he was a great novelist.
</P>
<P>
A delighted laugh. ``A great novelist! This is already something,
you know?''

 Mario Vargas Llosa: Hard Childhood (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mario Vargas Llosa, who has been Distinguished Writer
in Residence at Georgetown University this past semester, and his wife
Patricia rented a furnished town house on the edge of the university.
Besides some books, the only personal touch is some family photos.
There's a particularly charming snap of the couple and their three
children: Gonzalo, who works with the United Nations in Pakistan;
Alvaro, Op-Ed page editor for the Miami Herald's Spanish-language
edition; and Morgana, a student at the London School of Economics.
</P>
<P>
No such happy photos exist of Vargas Llosa's own childhood. His
just-released autobiography ``A Fish in the Water'' reveals that
underneath his suave air was a hardscrabble, semi-desperate youth. His
father, Ernesto Vargas, abandoned his wife, Dora, when she was five
months pregnant with the boy.
</P>
<P>
For the first 11 years of Mario's life he believed his father was
dead. Later, when the couple reunited, he merely wished it. Sometimes
Ernesto beat his wife; every so often he beat his son.
</P>
<P>
The paradox is, if Ernesto hadn't been so opposed to his son's
literary vocation -- writing was something homosexuals did; besides,
how could you make a living at it? -- Mario wouldn't have persevered.
</P>
<P>
``He sent me to a military school because he thought that was a
good antidote against literature, and he gave me through this
experience the raw material for my first novel -- which was so
successful I was able to become a writer.''
</P>
<P>
After that, when it came to his own children, he knew just what to
do.
</P>
<P>
``I renounced any kind of authority with them,'' he says blandly.
``My wife took total control. She was the authoritarian, so they love
me! I was the most stupidly passive father in history, so terrified
was I that they could feel about their father the way I feel about
mine.''

 Mary Chapin Carpenter, Taking Her Time (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Right now, Mary Chapin Carpenter's favorite song is
one nobody has written yet. ``Off the Road Again.''
</P>
<P>
After ``18 months of being out there all the time touring,''
Carpenter is taking serious time off for the first time in five years.
Actually, when her tour ended in November, she was just going to
hibernate through the winter and stir awake in the spring. But in
January Carpenter decided ``no more in '94.''
</P>
<P>
``I feel like I'm just starting to get used to it,'' she said last
week over coffee at an Alexandria, Va., cafe. ``Now it's great to call
a friend on a Saturday night and be able to go out and have dinner, as
opposed to `Well, I have to work tonight ... and I'm across the
country.' ''
</P>
<P>
Carpenter seems to have reacted to her success with a level head.
For instance, wearing jeans and a sweat shirt, Carpenter still looks
more the down-to-earth singer-songwriter than the star whose latest
album, ``Come On Come On,'' has sold 2.2 million copies and produced
seven hit singles, including the No. 1 country hit ``He Thinks He'll
Keep Her.''
</P>
<P>
``That notion of people changing is imposed on you by other
people,'' scoffs Carpenter, though she concedes that ``there's
elements of my life that have changed, and obligations.'' For one
thing, she now lives in Northern Virginia, convenient to National
Airport.
</P>
<P>
Carpenter, who recently set a record with three consecutive Grammys
as top female country vocalist, did just buy a house in Nashville -- 
``I was going down so much and hotel stuff was getting kind of old,''
she says. ``It's an experiment -- like a second home so it's not like
I'm just working down there -- but this is where I live. I feel like
I have the best of both worlds.'' Carpenter's producer and longtime
musical partner, John Jennings, has moved down to Nashville full time.
</P>
<P>
``There's just so many things you can do when you're touring,''
Carpenter explains. ``This is the year to do a lot of things I haven't
been able to do.'' Right now, she's keeping mum on details. Meanwhile,
Carpenter's new single is titled ``I Take My Chances.'' Of the seven
singles from ``Come On Come On,'' have gone Top 10 and two Top 5. This
is astounding, since the album has been out 97 weeks and remains in
the Top 100.
</P>
<P>
``It's got great shelf life!'' says Carpenter, as much with
amazement as pleasure.
</P>
<P>
As for the album's double-platinum status -- rare in country, even
rarer among women artists -- Carpenter can only say: ``Unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
Proving that time off is not a synonym for vacation, Carpenter will
soon start on her new album, due out at the end of September. It will
feature all originals, reflecting some of her ``free time.'' Only one
song is old -- ``Stones in the Road,'' which Joan Baez cut for her last
album after hearing Carpenter's studio recording.
</P>
<P>
At the request of Columbia Records, citing confusion, Carpenter
agreed to separate Mary and Chapin, hyphenated all her 36 years.
</P>
<P>
``But they have visiting rights,'' says their surname. ``God bless
people who don't proofread. I know they'll get back together again.''
Carpenter concedes, though, that the punctuation has been ``the bane
of my existence. One writer in Ohio wasn't sure, and put hyphens
between all three names. And when your own record company doesn't know
what the deal is, you know you're in trouble!''

 Work of Federal Contractors Questioned (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Firms that tap into an estimated $105 billion a year
in fees for counseling federal workers on retirement planning,
sensitivity training or estimating the costs of proposed regulations
might have a tougher time getting work under a bill introduced
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C., proposed legislation that would
shed light on what she calls the ``shadow government'' of contractors
and make it tougher for agencies to disguise costs by replacing civil
service with consultants.
</P>
<P>
It is the sort of thing that will unnerve Beltway Bandits -- the
disparaging nickname for corporations, think tanks, experts and
mom-and-pop consulting practices. The firms are often founded or
staffed by former feds.
</P>
<P>
Consultants include the proverbial smooth-talking expert who
borrows your watch and charges you $50 to tell you the time and
specialized groups that provide complex and necessary data at a lower
cost and with less political spin than the government. The General
Accounting Office recently said about half the contracts it studied
could have been done better or at less cost by federal employees.
</P>
<P>
Consultants can save taxpayers a bundle by rounding up experts to
do quick, accurate studies without creating a permanent bureaucracy
that qualifies for benefits and lifetime pensions.
</P>
<P>
But they also can be costly by marketing services that aren't vital
to the national interest or that indulge the pet project, peeve or
fantasy of a division chief or political appointee who may have a
brother-in-law contractor or who may be looking for future employment.
</P>
<P>
Norton says contractors are often invisible and unsupervised. Last
week she proposed cutting $1.9 billion from such personal service
contracts. The savings would fund full national and locality raises
next January for white-collar federal workers.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton has proposed a 1.6 percent raise, although
government data indicates workers are due an across-the-board 2.6
percent national increase plus locality adjustments that could range
from 2 percent to 4 percent depending on hometown private salaries.
</P>
<P>
Norton's new bills would bar agencies from contracting out work
performed by employees given buyouts to quit or retire and would set
up guidelines that agencies must use to justify retaining outside
contractors. It would also assure an accurate headcount on contractors
with its annual reporting to Congress. If the latter becomes law, some
agency is certain to hire a contractor to count its contractors.
</P>
<P>
-0- 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board says Tuesday's
Federal Diary item about the tax-deferred thrift savings plan
underestimated the number of participants. About 75 percent of the
employees in the new Federal Employees Retirement System and 44
percent of those under the old Civil Service Retirement System are
contributing to the savings plan.
</P>
<P>
But all FERS employees, whether or not they contribute, have
accounts thanks to an automatic employer contribution of 1 percent of
pay. The savings plan is now worth more than $22 billion, and the
average CSRS contributors account is $10,092.
</P>
<P>
The average FERS contributors' account is $15,043, and the average
account for noncontributing FERS employees is $1,679. Retirees cannot
join the savings plan or contribute to it. But workers who have
accounts when they retire can remain in the savings plan subject to
age rules set by the IRS.

 Russia Seeks Wider NATO Role (Brussels) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BRUSSELS, Beligum
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev called
Wednesday for the creation of a ``full-blooded strategic
relationship'' between his country and the Western military alliance
that was formed to contain its territorial ambitions.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with his counterparts from 16 NATO nations and
Russia's former Warsaw Pact allies in Eastern Europe, Grachev
reiterated Moscow's readiness to join, with no conditions attached,
the NATO program to enhance military cooperation with its former
enemies that is known as the Partnership for Peace.
</P>
<P>
But Grachev emphasized that the partnership was ``not a complete
answer, but only a first step'' toward dealing with the post-Cold War
security environment in Europe. He said Russia's status as Europe's
biggest nuclear power requires a broader ``consultative mechanism''
with NATO that would encompass disarmament, conversion of defense
industries and global threats such as terrorism, nuclear proliferation
and environmental pollution.
</P>
<P>
While expressing some caution about Russia's ambitions to create a
special relationship with the Western alliance, NATO ministers warmly
welcomed Moscow's willingness to join the partnership program after
months of ambivalent and contradictory statements.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William J. Perry praised the ``historic
nature'' of the meeting with his Russian counterpart and said ``we are
very pleased that he announced the unconditional decision for joining
Partnership for Peace.'' But several NATO officials were less
enthusiastic about Grachev's proposal to expand the relationship into
areas not covered under the terms of the military partnership. One
alliance official said Grachev appeared to be proposing that Russia
become a virtual member of NATO, something that would not be
acceptable to most member nations.
</P>
<P>
Before the session, senior NATO officials said they feared Grachev
would make unacceptable political demands that would scuttle hopes for
a Russian role in the partnership. But they said he gave everyone ``a
pleasant surprise'' by producing a lengthy document that included a
long list of projects, including joint efforts at peacekeeping,
technical training, military field exercises and strategic planning.
</P>
<P>
``It's looking very good,'' said British Defense Minister Malcolm
Rifkind. ``Russia clearly wants to play a constructive role working
with NATO on matters of common interest. But there will be no right
for Russia to take part in NATO's decision making.''
</P>
<P>
Germany's Volker Ruehe said ``we are definitely on the right track.
Parternship for Peace is a common position for everybody, but beyond
that there is scope for a partnership between Russia and NATO. But it
still needs to be worked out.''
</P>
<P>
The Russian defense minister gave no indication when his country
would join the program, which was formally launched by NATO leaders in
January as a way to satisfy demands from East European countries for a
closer security relationship with the West without fully incorporating
them into the alliance. A total of 18 countries from Eastern Europe
and the former Soviet Union have now signed up for the program.
</P>
<P>
Grachev insisted that Russia is not seeking ``a warmer place in the
sun'' than NATO's other partners to the east, but merely a
relationship ``adequate to its weight'' as a nuclear superpower with
territory stretching from Europe to the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
``Russia has an interest in wider forms of cooperation than
envisaged in this program,'' Grachev said. ``What we suggest is not to
limit the sphere of partnership, but to enrich it with cooperation
between Russia and NATO, not only in military areas but on other
important issues.''
</P>
<P>
In calling for a new strategic relationship with the Western
alliance, Grachev noted that many Russians still fear the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization as a hostile military alliance that
treated Russia as an enemy. He said such ``bloc-oriented perceptions''
must be surmounted by enhanced cooperation or they would eventually
trigger a new arms race in Europe.
</P>
<P>
In spelling out Russia's new military doctrine, Grachev made clear
to the Western ministers that Moscow still envisions the partnership
chiefly as a stepping stone to a new ``collective security system in
Europe.'' He said Russia still regards the 53-nation Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe as the basis for this system, in
which NATO would play a subordinate role.
</P>
<P>
Grachev acknowledged that Russia wants to strengthen the
Commonwealth of Independent States, the loose confederation of
republics that came into being after the breakup of the Soviet Union.
He said Russia's military presence in some republics known as its
``near abroad'' should be seen in terms of ``peacekeeping objectives''
that pose no security threat to its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
In response, Perry said any regional peacekeeping role should be
carried out through a U.N. mandate and that ``Russia's role should be
kept compatible'' with goals approved by the U.N. Security Council.

NON-FICTION 
</P>
<P>
``A VALLEY IN ITALY: The Many Seasons of a Villa in Umbria,'' 
 by Lisa St. Aubin De Teran (HarperCollins: $21, 224 pp.) 
</P>
<P>
One of the grand difficulties accompanying books about people who
find the perfect fixer-upper villa in some gorgeous, flavorful but not
too remote part of the world is that you must hate them with all your
heart. The other, more interesting problem is: How they fit into the
culture they invade and admire? What do they give back? Are their
observations evidence that they travel with their own culture and
experience keeping them afloat and apart like water wings? Or are they
porous and dignified in their differentness? Having heaped so many
caveats on these obnoxious pilgrims, let me now say that Lisa St.
Aubin de Teran gets it right. Sure, she's a bit of a poseur,
``instructed in the art of buying houses by Ted Hughes, our Poet
Laureate, who explained to me that first I should find the house I
wanted and then I should buy it, and only later worry about how to pay
for it,'' and in our American culture delusions of grandeur, visions
of loggias and balustrades and cantilevered thises and thats can be
off-putting. You're supposed to know your place and what you can
afford and keep your ego in check. Lisa St. Aubin de Teran takes her
two children; 6-year-boy Allie, and 15-year-old future super-model
``the child Iseult'' with her to set up house in the Villa Orsola in
the little village of San Orsela in the Umbrian hills. Her Scottish
painter husband comes later. She has patience and imagination and a
wonderful sense of humor. She has a kind of courage and equanimity,
and her observations of her own cast of characters is gracious and
generous and respectful. After visiting this long with her, it was
hard to leave -- a compliment to any hostess (or writer).
</P>
<P>
``VOICE LESSONS: On Becoming A Woman Writer,'' by Nancy Mairs 
 (Beacon, $15, 166 pp.) 
</P>
<P>
Where would we be without Nancy Mairs, vigilant chronicler of a
woman's life, a writer's life? We'd be stuck trying to convert the
five hundred pounds a year Virginia Woolf told us we'd need to write
into billable hours, like immoral lawyers calculating backward, that's
where. It has been said already that she is fearless, can write about
anything: depression, sex, adultery, religion and now, now writing(in
true life order of degree of risk). Which means that these essays look
more to the the stories writers write (in particular, Virginia Woolf,
Montaigne, and Hele ne Cixous, among others), the text, than they do
to immediate life experience, as in Mairs' other books. ``What has
interested me particularly,'' she writes, ``is the crucial role that
learning to decipher texts -- both my own experiences and the works of
other writers -- has played in my writerly evolution.''
</P>
<P>
Often asked, ``How did you find your voice?'' Mairs responds: ``In
the beginning was the Word. Not me. And the question, properly
phrased, should be asked of my voice: How did you find (devise,
invent, contrive) your Nancy?'' This may seem rhetorical, out of
context, but it relieves an enormous burden to find one's voice, as
distinct from others' and from the experience of others; a voice with
some critical authority and a great deal of distance from real-life
suffering -- a quest Mairs believes is uniquely male in nature.
</P>
<P>
Having grown up believing that men could fill emptiness in women,
for a long time Mairs wrote, she tells us, ``out of yearning.''
Filling voids with men is replaced, as she grows older and more
confident (with the help of other women, writers and friends), by
filling voids with ideas, bringing the same ardor to this yearning as
to the first: ``I could feel them in my flesh, quickening my breath,
itching my fingers. ... '' As always, Mairs' revelations and
transformations will translate more easily for some readers than
others, but her resolve and her ability to turn a once haphazard path
into a clear evolution (her own) is an inspiration. ``This is the
body,'' she writes, ``who works here.''
</P>
<P>
``BALSAMROOT: A Memoir,'' by Mary Clearman Blew (Viking, 
 $20.95, 212 pp.) 
</P>
<P>
Mary Clearman Blew, author of ``All But the Waltz,'' and two short
story collections, is on many people's best Western writing short
list. Born and raised in Montana, much of her writing ferrets out the
Montana history and landscape in her own life experiences; characters
from her youth and ancestry are analyzed for the choices they made
with an eye to the choices she's making. In this book she ponders her
relationship to a quickly aging and newly dependent aunt, as well as
an estranged and angry daughter. Efforts to honor the family code:
``Never speak aloud of what you feel deeply,'' make these urgent tasks
somewhat difficult and a little frustrating for the reader. When you
feel the urge to do group therapy, it's time to focus on the fine
writing; on the plant and animal life in the book; on the wonderful
terse evocation of her maiden aunt's one love affair.
</P>
<P>
``THE COAST OF SUMMER: Sailing New England Waters From Shelter 
 Island to Cape Cod,'' by Anthony Bailey (HarperCollins, $23, 
 368 pp.) 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the other fantasies on this page, journeys backward,
forwards and sideways, varying in expense and imagination, this is one
that remains fairly well cloistered from reality. Sailing yachts along
the coast of New England for entire summers is not something you can
recommend to people in an offhanded way. It seems even more difficult
than moving your family to a village in Umbria. But it's a culture,
with a language, and the nostalgia is somewhat contagious, even if the
yearning is downright unproductive. Don't let me burst your bubble,
let's let the author, in this comment about class on Fisher's Island
(affectionately known as ``Fishers'') do it himself: ``the local class
structure is evident in physiognomy, I decide (perhaps quite
unjustly).'' The very need for the parenthetical should clue you in.
``Messing about in boats'' needn't be so exclusive.
</P>
<P>
FICTION 
</P>
<P>
``Simple Prayers,'' by Michael Golding, Warner Books, 
 $17.95, 304 pp.) 
</P>
<P>
This delightful, exotic fable, part ``Tempest'' and part
``Decameron'' is so lavish, so dirt-rich and so colorful its like a
meal in the open air, laid out on brocade, under the pine and cypress
looking out at the ocean. Part of what gives the writing its
infallible charm is the fact that every fifth word is Italian, some
names of places or food, some just sprinkled generously over the meal.
This may annoy some people but that would be churlish. ``Terra del
Pozzo di Luna, campanili, mezzogiorno, Riva di Pignoli'' are hardly
words to shut a reader out. The characters, all living side by side
with their daily miracles and potions and transfigurations, are, for
the most part, lovable gnomes and gargoyles (the only really malicious
character is the black death). Things start going wrong on the little
island in the Venice lagoon, Riva di Pignoli, like objects tossed
around before a storm, like the rumbling before an earthquake. This is
a world in which climate and weather are affected by the passions and
disappointments of individuals, all of which are threatened by the
approaching plague. Their prayers may be simple, but the cacophony of
their daily lives is fascinating.

 House Panel Backs Modified Health Plan (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Clinton's health plan gained a second
toehold in its climb toward the House floor Wednesday, as a House
Education and Labor subcommittee approved a modified version on a
17-to-10 party-line vote.
</P>
<P>
``This is the president's second win in a row,'' said a jubilant
Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont., chairman of the labor-management
subcommittee, noting that a Clinton-like bill also won approval in a
House Ways and Means subcommittee a month ago.
</P>
<P>
The Education and Labor subcommittee bill incorporates several key
elements of President Clinton's plan: universal insurance coverage,
allowing people to continue purchasing private health insurance, a
guaranteed choice of health plans, benefits provided through the
workplace, and cost controls.
</P>
<P>
But the Williams subcommitee has a far-larger liberal Democratic
majority than most other committees and Congress as a whole, and the
president's bill is expected to experience tougher sledding in the
future.
</P>
<P>
Senior subcommittee Republican Marge Roukema, R-N.J., said the
Williams plan was unacceptable because of its heavy reliance on
federal controls and the high cost of the benefits added on by the
committee. In one of the most dramatic moments in the month-long
drafting process, Williams' subcommittee voted to retain Clinton's
requirement that health insurers pay for abortions.
</P>
<P>
Then, over several days, the committee added preventive health
benefits, mental health, adult dental care, new cancer screening and
rural health benefits to Clinton's proposal.
</P>
<P>
Williams said the net cost of the subcommittee's added provisions
would be $6 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
Some of the added costs would come from increasing subsidies to
small firms that otherwise would face difficulty buying health
insurance for their workers.
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee lacks jurisdiction over taxes, and therefore, many
of the toughest issues in health reform were not addressed.
</P>
<P>
Under the Williams bill, employers would have to pay 80 percent of
the cost of insurance premiums for their workers. However, small
business groups are fiercely opposed to this so-called ``employer
mandate,'' and the subcommittee voted to limit the premium for small
firms.
</P>
<P>
Employers with fewer than 25 workers and average wages of less than
$12,000 a year would be required to pay 2 percent of their payroll
costs toward insurance for their workers, rather than the 3.5 percent
proposed by Clinton. A firm paying the minimum wage of $4.25 an hour,
Williams said, would have added expenses of 8.5 cents an hour.
</P>
<P>
Other small firms would also be helped by ``caps'' on their premium
payments. Federal subsidies would help cover the rest of premium
costs.
</P>
<P>
The bill includes insurance reform. Charging people more for
insurance because of their health status or age or excluding them
altogether would not be allowed. Imsurers would have to accept all
applicants, and individuals with incomes under 200 percent of the
poverty line would receive special government subsidies to help cover
any premiums due.

 Editors:

   Here is an early look at the stories the Los Angeles Times is
considering for its first-edition Page 1 for Thursday:

   CLINTON-TIMES -- ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- President Clinton uses
commencement at the U.S. Naval Academy as a platform for a sharp
counterattack against critics of his Bosnia policy, accusing the
critics -- including many leaders of his own party -- of advancing
``simplistic ideas that sound good on bumper stickers but that would
have tragic consequences.'' In particular, Clinton denounces proposals
that the United States unilaterally violate the U.N. embargo against
arms shipments to Bosnia, proposals that leading Democrats have
endorsed and that enjoy support in Congress. By David Lauder.

   CHINA-POLICY -- WASHINGTON -- President Clinton prepares to make a
final decision on China's trade benefits as the White House struggles
to get the crucial support of Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
the architect of the policy of linking trade to human rights. The
administration is expected to announce its decision as early as
Thursday but it wants if possible to avoid the embarrassment of a
split with Mitchell. Over the past few days, administration officials
have decided to extend China's most-favored-nation trade benefits,
while raising tariffs on weapons made by China's People's Liberation
Army for sale in the United States. By Jim Mann.

   ROSTY-TIMES -- WASHINGTON -- Like a bizarre scene from the old ``Get
Smart'' comedy show, an odd ``cone of decorum'' has descended over the
House as it confronts the apparently imminent departure of Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski -- very likely to prison on a plea bargain to corruption
charges -- as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. The
powerful Illinois Democrat, an unparalleled master of arm-twisting and
deal-cutting, is considered critical to the fate of the Clinton
administration's health care reform and the Democrats' overall record
of accomplishment. Members of Congress wonder and worry about who will
succeed him -- and the implications for themselves and President
Clinton -- yet congressional decorum prevents anyone from talking
openly about it. By Karen Tumulty and Ronald J. Ostrow.

   BBN-STRAWBERRY -- LOS ANGELES -- Troubled Dodger outfielder Darryl
Strawberry is placed on waivers for the purpose of giving him his
unconditional release. The Dodgers say they reached a monentary
settlement with Strawberry, who admitted the day before the season
began that he had a substance abuse problem. He entered a treatment
program a short time later. By Maryann Hudson. (Will move on
ALL-SPORTS! service).

   TOBACCO -- Documents leaked from the files of Brown Williamson
Tobacco Co., the No. 3 U.S. cigarette company, are likely to be at the
focus of hearing Thursday by a House Health and Environment
subcommittee headed by Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., a leading
congressional tobacco foe. By Myron Levin.

 U.S. Expels Iraqi Diplomat (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iraq's senior diplomat in Washington has been expelled
from the United States for repeated violations of the agreement that
allows Iraq to maintain a diplomatic presence here, State Department
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat, Adnan Malik, attempted to lobby members of Congress,
sent out news releases espousing an end to the United Nations economic
embargo against his country and hired and fired staff members without
notifying the State Department, all actions that were specifically
prohibited, the U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
Malik's expulsion was not announced, but the State Department
confirmed the move when asked about it.
</P>
<P>
Malik, who was transferred to Washington in February from Iraq's
U.N. mission, began violating the rules within days of his arrival,
according to a State Department official who monitored his activities.
He routinely circumvented regulations that his predecessor had
scrupulously complied with for three years, the official said.
</P>
<P>
``He was attempting to function as a full-fledged diplomat'' but
was permitted only to provide consular services, such as issuing visas
and renewing passports of Iraqis who live in the United States, State
Department spokesman Michael McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Iraq have not had diplomatic relations since
the beginning of the Persian Gulf War in 1991. As is common in such
cases, the two countries permit each other to maintain limited
diplomatic missions under the flags of other nations. The United
States has an office in Baghdad under the flag of Poland, while the
three Iraqis stationed here are under the ``protection'' of the
Algerian embassy.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and other nations without embassies in Washington, such as
Vietnam and Cuba, have full-fledged diplomatic missions in New York.
Their envoys there are allowed to operate freely, although Washington
often restricts their travel outside the New York area.
</P>
<P>
Once Malik arrived in Washington, however, he began ``within a
week'' to violate an agreement that is ``very explicit about what the
Iraqi interests section is allowed to do,'' a State Department
official said.
</P>
<P>
``The second day he was here I went over this with him line by
line. I stressed that this was not a full diplomatic mission, it was a
protecting power arrangement and he was specifically forbidden to
engage in political activity,'' the State Department official said.
``He said, `I understand, I am a professional diplomat.' ''
</P>
<P>
But he began within days to violate the agreement, leasing property
without State Department approval, hiring and firing staff without
notifying the department and attempting to communicate with Congress
when the agreement specified he could communicate only through three
offices at State, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Malik's wife and children have been allowed to remain in New York
until the end of the school year, according to the State Department.
Iraq is free to replace him here but has not done so.

 Senate Deadlocked on Ambassadorial Nomination (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A sharply divided Senate Wednesday raked the lingering
embers of controversy over the United States' involvement in the
Vietnam War two decades ago as it remained deadlocked over the
ambassadorial nomination of former anti-war activist Sam W. Brown Jr.
</P>
<P>
For the second day in a row, Brown's supporters failed to break a
Republican-led filibuster against giving ambassadorial rank to Brown
as head of the U.S. delegation to the Vienna-based Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
They picked up two votes since Tuesday but, with the Senate
dividing 56 to 42 Wednesday in favor of ending the delaying tactics,
they remained four short of the 60 votes necessary to invoke cloture
and force the issue to a vote.
</P>
<P>
Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., who helped lead the fight for Brown's
confirmation, said another vote to end the filibuster is possible
after Congress returns June 7 from its Memorial Day recess. If at
least one more Republican breaks ranks, three Democrats of the four
who voted to sustain the filibuster are prepared to switch and bring
the issue to a vote, Kerry said.
</P>
<P>
Democrats who voted Wednesday against ending the filibuster were
Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, Ga., and Sens. J. James
Exon, Neb., Bob Kerrey, Neb., and Ben Nighthorse Campbell, Colo.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Hank Brown, R-Colo., who led the opposition to Brown, said he
believed another vote was unlikely because, even if the filibuster is
broken, the nomination is in serious trouble. He claimed at least 53
``clearly committed votes'' against confirmation.
</P>
<P>
Sam Brown's appointment as head of the U.S. delegation to the CSCE,
which promotes security and human rights in Europe, is not subject to
Senate approval. But, without Senate confirmation, he will not have
status as an ambassador, a rank enjoyed by his predecessors and his
European counterparts in the CSCE.
</P>
<P>
If the Senate rejects the nomination, Clinton would have to decide
whether to keep Brown on the job without ambassadorial status, Kerry
said. ``He can do the job without it,'' Kerry added.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's debate echoed with many of the bitter feelings that
characterized America's debate over the Vietnam War, with Republicans
attacking Brown's views and his lack of military experience and
Democrats defending his record as a principled crusader.
</P>
<P>
Brown ``opposed actions to block communism'' and should not now be
put in a position to ``deal with the world after communism,'' argued
Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., accusing the administration of slighting
veterans in favor of war protesters.
</P>
<P>
``The United States Senate should not lynch a nominee on the basis
of his exercise of his constitutional rights,'' contended Kerry,
describing Brown as someone who always worked ``within the system''
and eventually went on to become ``a full-fledged American capitalist
... the vice president of a shoe company.''
</P>
<P>
A key point of dispute -- which Republicans emblazoned in large
letters on a chart for the television cameras -- was a 1977 interview
in Penthouse magazine that quoted Brown as saying, ``I take second
place to no one in my hatred of the intelligence agencies.''
</P>
<P>
Kerry quoted Brown as saying the quotation ``does not accurately
reflect his views now or then'' and was made in reference to a
controversy at the time over CIA involvement with the Peace Corps,
which he oversaw as head of the ACTION in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, denounced it as an
expression of ``radical'' views, and Kerrey later told a reporter that
the comment about intelligence agencies was a major factor in his vote
against cloture.

 Weary Rwandan Army Exchanges Mortar Fire With Guerrillas (Nairobi) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NAIROBI, Kenya
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rwanda's battered army in the capital, Kigali,
regrouped Wednesday and exchanged heavy mortar fire into the evening
with rebel guerrillas who captured a strategic government position two
days ago, U.N. officials reported.
</P>
<P>
The fighting, which shattered a truce declared for the visit of a
senior U.N. envoy, again prevented relief supplies from being flown
into the capital and the U.N. officials expressed fears that shortages
of food and medicine had become critical.
</P>
<P>
One of the mortar rounds, apparently fired by rebels of the Rwanda
Patriotic Front, hit a Red Cross hospital in the government-controlled
section of Kigali, killing two Rwandan nurses, the officials said.
Rebels also pounded army positions near the defense ministry while the
army lobbed shell after shell on rebel forces on the outskirts of the
city.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Tutsi-dominated rebels -- who say they are fighting a
war of liberation against the predominantly Hutu government -- had
mounted a three-pronged attack and captured the Kanombe army camp
overlooking the airport. The three battalions of defenders fled and
some diplomatic observers in Nairobi believed that the rebels would
soon win the battle for Kigali.
</P>
<P>
But in other African wars -- in Liberia, Angola and Somalia, for
example -- armies that may have wilted in the countryside have been
willing to fight fiercely to defend their capitals. The reason is
particularly clear in Rwanda: The government, the military,
communications and transportation facilities are centralized in the
capital; without the capital, the government would have little left
worth fighting for.
</P>
<P>
The fighting Wednesday further delayed the arrival of a 5,500-man,
all-African peacekeeping force under U.N. command. The United Nations'
special envoy, Iqbal Riza, is in Kigali trying to persuade both sides
to allow deployment of the troops and the United Nations to take
control of the airport. But Riza's talks may be premature because only
three African nations -- Ethiopia, Ghana and Senegal -- have agreed to
participate in the force. Their commitment totals only 2,100 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Riza traveled in an armored vehicle through the fighting on the
western edge of the city to the seat of the interim government in
Gitarama, 25 miles southwest of Kigali, in hopes of holding talks
Thursday with the rebels in Mulindi, a rebel stronghold just south of
the Ugandan border.
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats in east Africa are not optimistic about the
chances for a lasting negotiated political settlement, because rebel
commanders appear to want nothing less than a military victory that
will put them in position to bargain for a large share of power, even
though the Tutsis amount to only 9 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, most moderate government officials who favored
conciliation between the majority Hutus and minority Tutsis had been
killed and the surviving officials now at Gitarama represent the
extremist wing. This element appears to support the eradication of the
Tutsis and is widely believed to be responsible for the widespread
massacres that have claimed the lives of as many as 200,000 Rwandans,
most of them Tutsis, since April 6.
</P>
<P>
The fighting is slowly turning Kigali into a ghost town and is
depopulating the countryside. Only about 50,000 people from Kigali's
population of 300,000 remain, U.N. officials said, and wide belts of
villages in eastern Rwanda have been abandoned. The United Nations has
set up 15 camps in neighboring Tanzania, Uganda and Zaire for the
estimated two million Rwandans who are now homeless.

 TV SPOTS: Jay Leno's Trip to New York Was Learning Experience 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jay Leno says he didn't realize, until he brought ``The Tonight
Show'' to the Big Apple last week, that he has been aping Johnny
Carson's program and not being himself ever since he took over for the
latter two years ago. ``I've been doing Johnny's show,'' Leno told NBC
affiliates this week. So Leno, who came close to a first-place tie
with ``The Late Show With David Letterman'' during his week here, is
having his Burbank, Calif., set changed to look more like the one he
used in New York, where his set's atmosphere approached that of clubs
where Leno spent two decades doing standup comedy. The tinier set in
New York's ``Saturday Night Live'' studios packed a smaller audience
closer to Leno, who was practically next to musical director Branford
Marsalis. ``The audience was half the size, but there was more
energy,'' said Leno, and there was an easier give-and-take between him
and Marsalis, who, in Burbank, is half a huge stage away. In any case,
the Burbank set shortly will be torn apart and made to look like the
one Leno used in New York.

 Works Confirm de Kooning's Place as Modernist Great (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The magnificent retrospective of Willem de Kooning's
paintings at the National Gallery of Art throws the artist's
breathtaking achievement into high relief. More than ever, he is
confirmed as the last great exemplar of a European tradition of modern
art, as altered and transmogrified by his loving encounter with his
adopted home.
</P>
<P>
De Kooning, a Dutch emigre to the United States, transformed
Parisian Cubism and European Expressionism, infusing them with a scale
and a temperament distinctly American and particular to New York.
Cubism and Expressionism were writ large, in dazzlingly complex images
of women begun circa 1949 and in luxurious, landscape-inspired
abstractions that followed half a dozen years later.
</P>
<P>
The retrospective, which brings together 76 paintings on canvas,
paper and board, begins in 1938 with de Kooning's peculiar figure
studies of men and women in indeterminate interiors. They seem to
merge an affection for the ``little brown paintings'' of Dutch old
masters with a thoroughly modern, specifically Cubist interest in
constantly shifting points of view. Together, these impulses are
inflected by the salutary influence of painter Arshile Gorky, his
great friend, mentor and fellow immigrant (from Armenia).
</P>
<P>
The show concludes in 1986 with the big canvases of loose,
light-filled, open interlaces of color darting through fields of
tinted white. The best of them rank as an astonishing coda to an
already astonishing career.
</P>
<P>
The museum has mounted the retrospective on the occasion of de
Kooning's 90th birthday; he was born in Rotterdam April 24, 1904, came
to the United States illegally in 1926 and stopped painting in the
late 1980s, when the debilitating effects of Alzheimer's disease ended
his artistic life. National Gallery curator Marla Prather, English
critic and historian David Sylvester and Nicholas Serota, director of
London's Tate Gallery, have assembled a nearly flawless array of
paintings to tell their tale.
</P>
<P>
That rarely flagging level of quality is crucial, because the last
opportunity to survey de Kooning's work -- a 1983 retrospective at New
York's Whitney Museum of American Art -- could be described most
charitably as erratic in the loans that were secured. With few notable
exceptions, topped by the missing ``Pink Angels'' from circa 1945, all
the pivotal paintings are in Washington. As a result, it's easy to
follow the internal trajectory of de Kooning's art.
</P>
<P>
The most important insight de Kooning took from Cubism was his
sensual articulation of the surface of a painting as a bodily
metaphor. The Cubist structure on which the great, rambunctious
``Woman'' paintings rely is harnessed by de Kooning as a way to unfold
the body in keeping with the two-dimensional space of painting. He had
mastered the device in the vigorous, mural-like abstraction
``Excavation,'' painted for the 1950 Venice Biennale and completed
while he was struggling with the newer figure paintings.
</P>
<P>
Formally, in the show's group of 14 paintings dating from 1949 to
1955, the women are squared off, flattened out, interlocked with the
surrounding environment. Raucous, funny, flirtatious and aggressive,
they embody the mesmerizing fierceness of flesh and blood.
</P>
<P>
De Kooning used a variety of tricks to pump up the sensuously
inviting tactility of his surfaces, including his famous wet-on-wet
technique of mixing salad oil in the pigment, in order to make it
slithery, fluid and receptive to sustained periods of work. It didn't
dry out fast.
</P>
<P>
As he worked he would repeatedly scrape down the surface, leaving
layered smears and traces of underpaint to show through, like
insistent memories of past encounters piling up one atop the other.
His paintings can look slatternly, as if they've been around.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
When engrossed by that gorgeously seductive dynamic, the viewer may
easily forget the complicated art scene de Kooning worked in. He had
been living in New York for about a decade when the influx of European
modern artists fleeing Hitler arrived, and after World War II he
naturally stayed. (He still wasn't a citizen and wouldn't become one
until 1962, but he considered himself an American nonetheless.) The
volatile avant-garde context that marked the immediate postwar years
in Manhattan was small, cliquish and without much public following.
But as a devastated Europe lay in ruins, the sense of needing to pick
up art's fallen torch was strong.
</P>
<P>
Abstract Expressionism was thus tinctured with a missionary aura.
De Kooning, the European expatriate who had worked his way across the
Atlantic and then jumped ship when docked at Newport News, Va., was in
part a bridge between the Old World and the New. In many ways his work
embodied the span.
</P>
<P>
The National Gallery has done a remarkably good job, tripping up
just once at the beginning and once at the end of the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
At the start a serious fault is the absence of ``Pink Angels,'' a
smallish painting inspired by Picasso but marked by a voluptuous,
transparent linearity wholly de Kooning's own. Without it, you just
can't make the leap from the show's first room, with its six
relatively conventional pink and ochre studies of male and female
figures, to the startling second room, filled with six exciting black
paintings, through which whiplash lines of white create a magical
interpenetration of crystalline and biomorphic shapes. With these, de
Kooning was on his way.
</P>
<P>
Despite numerous entreaties, according to the National Gallery, Los
Angeles collector Frederick Weisman simply would not lend ``Pink
Angels.''
</P>
<P>
The second problem is the final room. In the 1980s -- and in his
increasingly debilitated dotage -- de Kooning was still enthralled with
the soul-shattering, life-altering possibilities for visual pleasure
in painting. But the eight selected canvases are uneven at best.
Especially on the heels of the knockout gallery of gorgeous pictures
from 1977-78 that immediately precedes it, the erratic last room
inappropriately sends you out the door with a few doubts about the
claims that have been made for de Kooning's last works.
</P>
<P>
Despite these small deficiencies, the retrospective remains a
superlative achievement that sets up an extravagant argument in favor
of a kind of visual knowledge often erroneously dismissed as
irrelevant today, but nonetheless being championed by many of our most
compelling younger artists. De Kooning at 90 stands as a gorgeously
convincing precedent.

 Ironies Abound at Meeting of NATO, Russian Leaders (Brussels) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BRUSSELS, Belgium
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Russia's Pavel S. Grachev was the perfect host
Wednesday as he opened a meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary William
J. Perry. The irony of the situation only seemed to buoy his mood even
more.
</P>
<P>
``It seems strange to me that I'm welcoming you here to this
building today,'' the Russian defense minister told his American
counterpart, smiling at the circumstances. Perry too broke into a
grin.
</P>
<P>
The session over which Grachev was presiding was being held in
Conference Room No. 2 at NATO headquarters, and the sign outside
announced ``Russia'' -- for the Russian delegation.
</P>
<P>
Grachev, a four-star general who made 634 parachute jumps while he
was an officer in the former Soviet army, was taking the biggest leap
of his career: He was here to sign Russia up for NATO -- as a sort of
associate member for now.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Russians were not the only military officials from
the former East Bloc to rate their own suite at this week's NATO
ministerial meeting. The broad, heavily carpeted concourse that leads
to NATO's main meeting chamber was dotted with the oversized military
caps of officers from 18 other one-time Communist countries.
</P>
<P>
It might have been a meeting of the now-defunct Warsaw Pact, joked
a local wag.
</P>
<P>
The session, which followed a meeting of NATO defense ministers on
Tuesday, marked the first meeting of the Partnership for Peace, an
auxiliary program that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has set
up for former East Bloc countries. And for all of the joking, it was
one of those days on which even the most seasoned diplomats and
military officers were overcome by the sense that they were witnessing
an important piece of history.
</P>
<P>
``I think everyone is sort of awed by it all,'' mused a U.S.
officer who has spent his career trying to prepare for a possible
confrontation with Soviet forces. ``I thought I'd never see this
come.''
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the Russians will not actually join the PfP, as it is
becoming known here, until sometime in early June, when Moscow
presents its final application at a meeting of NATO foreign ministers
in Istanbul, Turkey.
</P>
<P>
But Grachev was here this week to present formally Russia's
preliminary proposal for its terms of membership -- ending weeks of
hot-and-cold statements from Moscow about whether the Kremlin would or
would not sign up.
</P>
<P>
And, to the relief of Western diplomats, he was unambiguous about
reports that the Russians would insist on special conditions:
``Absolutely nyet,'' he told reporters at the opening of the session.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
A mood of optimism lasted all day Wednesday. After the morning
session, the NATO ministers, Grachev and the defense chiefs of the 18
Partnership for Peace member countries posed for what was deliberately
dubbed a ``family portrait.''
</P>
<P>
And Ukraine's defense minister, Vitaly Radetsky, who was scheduled
to meet with Perry after the session with Grachev, refused to take
offense when the American was late.
</P>
<P>
``We'll make up for it tonight,'' he said lightheartedly.
</P>
<P>
The ironies continued into the evening.
</P>
<P>
After a day of bilateral meetings here in Brussels, Perry and the
other ministers flew by helicopter to the Belgian city of Mons for a
tour of the new building at the allies' European headquarters that
will serve as a military center for Partnership for Peace countries.
</P>
<P>
The structure, which was completed in 1990, originally was built as
an evacuation center in case western Europe were invaded by the Soviet
Bloc. A chunk of the fallen Berlin Wall now serves as statuary at its
entrance.
</P>
<P>
Pavel Grachev looked as though he were perfectly at home.

 Clinton Chastises Congress on Bosnia (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Clinton Wednesday chastised Congress for
trying to impose simplistic, ``bumper-sticker'' solutions on conflicts
like Bosnia and he warned that Americans must learn that efforts to
expand democracy's reach sometimes will be slow and flawed.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the graduating class of the U.S. Naval Academy in
Annapolis, Md., Clinton used Bosnia as an example of a messy,
complicated, post-Cold War world where there are no easy answers. An
effort in Congress to end the arms embargo against the Bosnian Muslims
so they can defend themselves, he said, is one of those actions ``that
sound simple and painless and good'' but will not work.
</P>
<P>
Doing that, he said, would ``kill the peace process, sour our
relationships with our European allies'' who support the U.N.-imposed
embargo, and undermine the relationship with Russia, which also
supports the embargo. Lifting the embargo, he said, is part of ``the
easy out of simplistic ideas that sound good on bumper stickers but
that would have tragic consequences.''
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who leaves next week for the 50th anniverary commemoration
of the D-Day invasion, said the sacrifices of the World War II
generation produced the freedom and security that helped America win
the Cold War. Today's opportunity, he said, is that ``for the first
time in history, we have the chance to expand the reach of democracy
and economic progress across the whole of Europe and to the far
reaches of the world.''
</P>
<P>
That task, he said, will be a long one. ``It took years after D-Day
to not only end the war, but to build a lasting peace. It took decades
of patience and strength and resolve to prevail in the Cold War. And
as with generations going before, we must often be willing to pay the
price of time, sometimes the most painful price of all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The Cold War's end, he said, ``lifted the lid from a cauldron of
long-simmering hatreds. Now, the entire global terrain is bloody with
such conflicts.''
</P>
<P>
Instead of the superpower, bipolar world that dictated America's
policies for four decades, the country now is faced with a leadership
role in ``a new world threatened with instability, even abject chaos,
rooted in the economic dislocations that are inherent in the change
from communist to market economics, rooted in religious and ethnic
battles long covered over by authoritarian regimes now gone, rooted in
tribal slaughters, aggravated by environmental disaster, by abject
hunger, by mass migrations. ... ''
</P>
<P>
Determining which conflicts in such a world merit U.S. action and
at what level involves ``no magic formula'' but an assessment of ``the
cumulative weight of the American interests at stake.''
</P>
<P>
Making that calibration, he said, has ``not been easy or smooth''
and may never again be. ``The world's most tearing conflicts, in
Bosnia and elsewhere, are not made in a day. And one of the most
frustrating things that you have to live with ... is that many of
these conflicts will rarely submit to instant solutions.''
</P>
<P>
Clinton paid tribute to the World War II veterans who stood for
recognition in the vast stadium and said to the graduating class, the
grandchildren of those veterans, that their challenge ``is to remember
the deeds of those who served before you, and now to build on their
work'' in protecting and expanding democracy and freedom.
</P>
<P>
That generational theme is expected to be a major one of the
president's week-day European tour, which includes a number of D-Day
events.
</P>
<P>
Clinton opened his remarks by following the tradition of granting
amnesty to midshipmen for rules infractions. But he pointedly noted
that covered only minor offenses. The academy was torn by a cheating
scandal that resulted in the expulsion of 24 midshipmen.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that problem, and the Tailhook scandal
involving sexual harassment of female Navy officers, are ``troubling
events, to be sure, because our military rests on honor and
leadership.'' But, he said to the graduates and the Navy leadership,
``You have my confidence. You have America's confidence.''
</P>
<P>
And as if he were commenting on his own bumpy first year in office
as well, he said, ``Ultimately, the test of leadership is not constant
flawlessness. Rather, it is marked by a commitment to continue always
to strive for the highest standards, to learn honestly when one falls
short, and to do the right thing.''

 All Students Could Profit From Developing Info Superhighway (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Students in the poorest public schools could have
access to all the books at Harvard and the treasures of libraries and
museums nationwide, if, as many educators and government officials
hope, American schools are given free or inexpensive access to the
developing information superhighway.
</P>
<P>
Some leading members of the Senate, along with Education Secretary
Richard W. Riley, Wednesday urged Congress to approve a federal policy
that would ensure that schools are not bypassed as cable and telephone
lines are installed for the electonic highway.
</P>
<P>
Riley described the superhighway as a ``seamless web of
communications networks, computers, databases, and consumer
electronics that will put vast amounts of information at our
fingertips.'' If some schools cannot afford this technological tool
because of costly user fees, it would further widen the gap between
rich and poor schools, he said.
</P>
<P>
A study by consumer and civil rights groups issued this week raised
similar concerns about how this new technology may have the effect of
widening the education and income gap between the wealthy and the
poor. The information highway, a priority of the Clinton
administration, is still being developed and how much it will cost
users is unclear.
</P>
<P>
But Riley urged Congress as it considers the Telecommunication Act
of 1994 to approve a policy that mandates a ``public or educational
lane on the information superhighway.''
</P>
<P>
Sen. Fritz Hollings, D-S.C., chairman of the Senate Committee on
Commerce, Science and Transportation, said he, too, was concerned that
the new highway might turn into a ``toll road'' only the wealthy could
ride.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., invited a principal and student from his
home state to Wednesday's hearing to demonstrate breakthrough
educational technology being used in Nebraska. A new IBM project
called ``Eduport'' is digitalizing video stored at museums and
universities around the country, storing it at the University of
Nebraska and then sending it, via fiber optic cable, to a public high
school in Lincoln, Neb.
</P>
<P>
Kathryn Piller, principal of Lincoln High, the one school in the
country now using this technology, wowed the crowd in the Senate
committee room by punching up on a television screen footage and audio
of President Franklin D. Roosevelt delivering his 1936 ``repudiating
communism speech.'' The old, black and white footage, and familiar
sound of his voice, is used in the school's American history classes.
</P>
<P>
This kind of technology that can bring almost limitless information
to the most remote or poor school eventually could be used by millions
of students, advocates said. Students would not have to be able to
afford a trip to Smithsonian or NASA or Harvard, but would have access
to all the educational materials they store.
</P>
<P>
``We are not out to get rid of books,'' said Lincoln High School
student Clay Ehlers. ``We are ought to get more books.'' Ehlers told
the senators that he believed students can learn better, and enjoy it
more, through the new technology. ``If you can see it and hear it and
get it from anywhere in the world, there is nothing better.''
</P>
<P>
Linda Roberts, special adviser to Riley on technology, said some
states were already making it a priority to get preferential rates for
schools and libraries so that the new technology didn't become a tool
only for those who could afford it. What the country did not want to
see happen, she said, was for the public schools in some states to get
on the highway and others to be bypassed.
</P>
<P>
The days when No. 2 pencils and chalkboards are all the supplies
teachers needed have slipped by, Riley said. If the United States
wants to stay competitive with other nations also developing similar
technology, it must give all students ``full and free acess'' to
information highway, even if it is costly.

 Russian Writer Ends U.S. Exile (Cavendish, Vt.) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
CAVENDISH, Vt.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After 18 years of exile in the wooded hills of
small-town Vermont, the great Russian writer and Nobel Prize winner
Alexander Solzhenitsyn left here Wednesday much as he arrived -- 
quietly and nearly alone.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by a few family members and surrounded by a throng of
photographers, Solzhenitsyn began his long-awaited journey homeward
shortly after noon. Sitting in the rear of an Oldsmobile station
wagon, the reclusive writer, who is 75, stopped briefly in the drizzle
at the end of his unpaved driveway.
</P>
<P>
For a few moments he obliged the photographers by getting out of
the car and posing silently next to one of the wooden posts that
supported the gate that for two decades had kept the world at bay.
</P>
<P>
Having written hundreds of thousands of words at his hillside
retreat, Solzhenitsyn had almost nothing to say. He offered a softly
spoken ``Goodbye'' in accented English, butotherwise stuck to his
promise to make no statements. His only utterances were, ``My son has
answered all questions'' -- an assertion that was not quite true -- and
a warning to photographers as they backed up into his car, ``Be
careful! Be careful!''
</P>
<P>
His departure drew more than 20 reporters and photographers to the
unmarked dirt road that led to the Solzhenitsyn compound.
</P>
<P>
Winner of the Nobel Prize for literature in 1970 for his powerful
novels dissecting Stalinism and the Soviet state, Solzhenitsyn chose
this spot after being expelled in 1974 from the then Soviet Union on
the grounds that his writings had slandered the Soviet state. He
continued to write books that nettled the communists -- including the
multi-volume historical novel ``The Red Wheel'' -- and elected to
remain here well after the collapse of the Soviet empire.
</P>
<P>
Solzhenitsyn faces an uncertain future as he heads to an apartment
in Moscow and, ultimately, a dacha outside the city. According to
family members, he planned to fly to the West Coast and on to
Vladivostok, where he plans to board a train for a cross-country tour
of Russia.
</P>
<P>
He leaves behind a town of 1,325 in central Vermont that treated
him just as he wished: by leaving him alone.
</P>
<P>
Just outside the door of the Cavendish General Store is a small
wooden sign saying, ``No directions to the Solzhenitsyn home.''
Storekeeper Joe Allen said he stuck to that policy right to the end.
</P>
<P>
``I decided I didn't want anything happening to anybody. There's a
lot of crazy people,'' said Allen, 43, who lives in one half of the
building that houses the store.
</P>
<P>
He said the Solzhenitsyn family were ``fine people'' who had never
bothered anyone. Alexander Solzhenitsyn was in his store just once,
about three or four years ago, Allen recalled.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, sightings of Solzhenitsyn outside his wooden retreat were
about as rare as encounters with the moose and black bear that share
these forested hills.
</P>
<P>
Richard Svec, the Cavendish town manager, said he spoke with the
author's wife, Natalya, Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
``There was a note of nervousness. But when you're moving your
household halfway around the world that's not surprising,'' he said.
``We did discuss that there are a lot of challenges ahead and that
they are trying to be a constructive influence. She asked for our
prayers.''
</P>
<P>
Svec said he understood that the family intended to keep the house
for the use of two sons, Stephan and Ignat, who are remaining in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Solzhenitsyn said his formal goodbyes to Cavendish on
Feb. 28 at the annual town meeting. ``I hope that I can be of at least
some help to my tortured nation, although it is impossible to predict
how successful my efforts will be,'' the author explained at the time.
</P>
<P>
``You were very understanding,'' he told the townsfolk. ``You ...
took it upon yourselves to protect my privacy.''
</P>
<P>
``For this, I have been truly grateful throughout all these years.
And now, as my stay here comes to an end, I thank you. Your kindness
and cooperation helped to create the best possible conditions for my
work.''

 Federal Review Board Member Cleared of Harassment Charges (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A White House review has cleared a Merit Systems
Protection Board member of sexually harassing an employee and then
firing her after she complained about his conduct, administration
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that, as a result of the review, Antonio C.
Amador, will remain in his position on the board, which is responsible
for reviewing federal employees' claims of discrimination and sexual
harassment.
</P>
<P>
The White House commissioned the investigation after receiving
requests for an inquiry from members of the House and Senate
committees charged with overseeing government operations.
</P>
<P>
Then-White House counsel Bernard Nussbaum told the members that
Clinton had decided ``that an independent factual review of the
allegations against Mr. Amador is warranted.'' Under federal law, only
the president may remove Amador from his position. Amador was
appointed by then-President George Bush in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The investigation was assigned to Joseph G. Lynch, assistant
general counsel in the Office of the General Counsel of the Navy. The
White House said Lynch ``has more than 12 years of government
experience in labor and employment law, with an expertise in sexual
harassment matters.''
</P>
<P>
The administration officials said Lynch had submitted his report
within the last several weeks and that Amador had been cleared. They
did not provide details of Lynch's findings, and an attorney for
Amador said his client has not been informed of the outcome. The
lawyer, Michael J. Riselli, said earlier that Amador ``categorically
denies any and all allegations and suggestions that he engaged in any
form of discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
The allegations against Amador were detailed in a letter signed by
seven members of the House Government Operations subcommittee on
employment, housing, and aviation following a six-month investigation.
</P>
<P>
According to the letter, the woman -- whose name was not used -- was
hired by Amador as a confidential assistant and worked as one of his
four staff members from March 11, 1991 until she was fired February
18, 1993.
</P>
<P>
The day before she was let go, Feb. 17, the woman complained of
sexual harassment to an equal employment opportunity (EEO) counselor
at the Merit Systems Protection Board, claiming that she was sexually
harassed ``over a one-year period both in the office and off federal
premises.''
</P>
<P>
Although the letter does not describe the alleged harassment,
sources said she complained that Amador made ``unwanted physical
contact'' with the woman, made sexually offensive remarks, and
suggested at least once that they spend the night together.
</P>
<P>
The date after the woman sought EEO counseling, the letter said,
Amador fired her and ordered her escorted out of the office
immediately.
</P>
<P>
Amador, according to the letter sent to the White House, told the
subcommittee that he informed the assistant several days earlier, on
Feb. 9, that he ``had lost confidence in her'' and requested that she
look for another job. On that day, according to the letter, Amador
also gave the employee a superior performance rating.
</P>
<P>
In another letter, to Rep. William Zeliff, R-N.H., Amador said he
gave the employee a good job rating simply to help her find a new
position and then decided to shorten the 30-day period because ``she
brazenly tried to coerce me, by threats of a fabricated sexual
harassment complaint, into keeping her employed.''
</P>
<P>
After her dismissal, the woman retained a lawyer and negotiated a
sealed settlement agreement under which she was reinstated, assigned
to a regional office, and received a cash payment of $17,500.

 PAPERBACK BOOKS: Capsule Reviews of Recent Releases 
 ``AMERICAN GROUND ZERO: The Secret Nuclear War,'' 
 by Carole Gallagher (Random House, $30, 361 pp.). 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gallagher interviewed dozens of men and women to document the U.S.
government's callous exposure of citizens in Nevada and Utah to
radiation from above-ground nuclear tests during 1950s. Soldiers were
sent into ``hot'' areas shortly after detonation to retrieve
equipment. Civilians in nearby towns came to watch the blasts -- and
the strange, pinkish clouds of dust and ash that killed sheep by the
thousand. Since then, local residents have suffered from abnormally
high incidents of cancer, autoimmune diseases, reproductive problems,
hormonal imbalances, nerve damage and birth defects. They bitterly
recall how their government used them as expendable guinea pigs, then
lied about it. This deeply disturbing book only begins to explore one
of the most shameful episodes of the Cold War: Many of the men recall
seeing cages near ground zero that held chained animals and humans.

 ``The Three-Inch Golden Lotus,'' by Feng Jicai translated from 
 the Chinese by Eugene M. Kayden (University of Hawaii Press, 
 $12.95, 239 pp., paperback original). 
</P>
<P>
Foot-bound girls had their toes bent under their arches and the
balls of their feet pressed against the fronts of their heels to
produce a small, deformed grub of flesh that became the object of a
national fetish in China. Feng Jicai's curious novel exposes the
cruelty of the practice and the weird sexual-aesthetic response it
evoked. As a child, Golden Lotus screams in pain when her feet are
bound, breaking many of the bones. But her tiny feet enable her to
marry the son of a wealthy merchant, and Golden Lotus uses her
position as an object of desire to gain power over her decadent
in-laws. Feng's sardonic prose contrasts her calculating intelligence
with the shallowness of the men, who extol the details of her shoes
like connoisseurs praising an antique vase.

June 6, 1944, marked a turning point in World War II. The success
of D-day was the result of the growing strength of the Allies, an
ingenious hoax that played on Hitler's certainty that Calais would be
the site of any attempted landing, the ineffective German command
structure, the interruption of communications by French Resistance
sabotage and plain luck. Man uses maps and contemporary photographs to

 by Mitchell Duneier (University of Chicago Press, $9.95,

<P>
In this modest study of working-class men, Duneier argues, ``Black
men are badly misunderstood, probably no less because of the
well-meaning liberal media's constant barrage of images showing how
bad things have become to Republican advertisements indicating that
liberals have placed killers like Willie Horton back on the streets.''
Slim and his friends are unassuming men who socialize in a cafeteria
at the edge of the Chicago ghetto. Unlike the media images of black
males as dope peddlers, gangbangers and felons, they believe in
honesty, hard work and ``modes of conduct that testify to
respectability.'' Duneier presents a brief look at a neglected sector
of society that offers much-needed role models for teen-age boys of

title story recounts the curious misadventures the narrator's prim

Singer, songwriter, radio personality, journalist, record producer,
one-hit rock star and pop culture gadfly, Ian Whitcomb sets the tone
for this memoir when he declares in an early diary entry, ``Wish I was
like a rock 'n' roll record.'' The journal entries, articles,
interviews and remembrances in this lively collection document
encounters with icons that range from Mae West and Walter Matthau to

 Congressional Losses Underscore Democrats' Vulnerability 
 In Midterm Elections, Analysts Say 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Back-to-back congressional losses underscore the Democrats'
vulnerability in this fall's midterm elections and could foreshadow
significant Republican gains in the South, analysts in both parties
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Republican officials quickly capitalized on their easy victory
Tuesday in the Kentucky congressional district held for 41 years by
the late William H. Natcher, D, and an earlier win in a
Democratic-held district in Oklahoma, claiming the races showed
growing public dissatisfaction with President Clinton and the
Democrats who control Congress.
</P>
<P>
``I think what we just did is a test run in Oklahoma and
Kentucky,'' said House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, R-Ga. ``Morale and
momentum and therefore resources are shifting our way and Democrats
are disoriented and don't want to defend Clinton and can't run away
from him.''
</P>
<P>
Democratic National Committee Chairman David Wilhelm blamed the
Kentucky defeat on a candidate ``who got in a defensive crouch and
stayed there.'' Wilhelm urged Democrats to ``stand tall'' in defending
the record of the Clinton administration of ``standing up for
middle-class families and breaking gridlock.''
</P>
<P>
But other Democrats, while cautioning that special elections are
often poor predictors of later contests, were more pessimistic,
especially in their private comments. They said Clinton is likely to
be an issue in many marginal races in the South.
</P>
<P>
``I think we've got serious problems, particularly in the South and
Southwest,'' one Democratic operative said.
</P>
<P>
Even Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., who chairs the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee and who echoed Wilhelm's analysis of
the Kentucky race, warned that the Republicans could rack up big gains
this fall.
</P>
<P>
Fazio called the Kentucky race unique, but said it nonetheless may
serve ``as a wake-up call'' to the party. ``I've been talking about
our potential of losing up to 25 seats and I've been very serious
about it.''
</P>
<P>
The Kentucky election left the Democrats holding a 257-to-178
advantage in the House, along with their 56-to-44 margin in the
Senate. A gain of even 15 House seats would give Republicans their
largest number since the mid-1950s and greater gains could cost
Democrats their working majority. Working control of the Senate is
also threatened by the recently announced retirements of Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and Sen. David Boren,
D-Okla.
</P>
<P>
The party that holds the White House generally loses House seats in
midterm elections. But the Democrats' historical disadvantage is
compounded this year by a variety of factors. They include voter anger
toward Washington, Democratic retirements in marginal House districts,
the effects of redistricting and Clinton's unpopularity in the South.
</P>
<P>
Republican strategist Whit Ayres said the two special House races,
combined with last year's string of Republican victories ``send a very
clear message, that voters around the country, and particularly voters
in the South, are very unhappy with the leadership provided by
President Clinton and the Democrats in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
Clinton's popularity varies from region to region and a White House
official said many Democrats are anxious for his help this year. But
the danger for House Democrats in districts where Clinton's
favorability ratings are weak is most apparent in the 28 open seats
where Democratic incumbents have announced their retirements or are
seeking higher office.
</P>
<P>
In 17 of the 28 districts, Clinton's vote in 1992 was below his
national average of 43 percent, and in 11 of those districts, most of
them in the South, George Bush beat Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Republican pollster Bill McInturff said that, in the South, the
Clinton administration is facing growing hostility.
</P>
<P>
``In focus groups, there is an historic anti-governemnt
sentiment,'' McInturff said. ``What they see Clinton doing, on taxes,
the economy, health care, these are seen as symbols of Jimmy Carter,
round two. The guy is raising taxes and overreaching the role of
government.''
</P>
<P>
Emory political scientist Merle Black, who has specialized in the
study of Southern politics, said, ``Clinton is not an asset in most
Southern congressional districts.'' and predicted that Republican
candidates would mimic the kind of campaign Republican Ron Lewis ran
in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
Lewis ran an explicitly anti-Clinton campaign that included one
television ad in which the face of Democrat Joe Prather turned into
the face of Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
``I wouldn't be too surprised to see that ad in 200 districts in
October,'' Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
``I hope so,'' responded presidential pollster Stan Greenberg. ``I
think people will vote for change rather than negativism and a return
to the Reagan-Bush years.''
</P>
<P>
Greenberg and other Democrats said it's too early to make
predictions about November, despite the losses in Kentucky and
Oklahoma, and that the outcome of the health-care debate could become
a major factor in the fall.
</P>
<P>
``I don't think the story of the off-year elections is going to be
decided until October,'' he said. ``People are going to make a
decision of whether we're moving the country forward or whether we're
stuck. And right now, they don't know.''
</P>
<P>
But Republican pollster Linda Divall said many voters are still
angry with Washington. She said the special-election results were not
just a vote against Clinton. ``It was also a warning signal that the
changes voters cast their votes for in 1992 have not come about and
they are still frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
She and others noted the continued intense anger over congressional
check bouncing, and argued that almost any outcome in the pending
criminal case of Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., will damage Congress
and the Democrats. ``Any plea bargain is going to look very bad,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
Democrats worry that low voter turnout, which occurred in Kentucky,
will hurt their candidates this fall. ``The people on the outs are
much more motivated to vote than our people are,'' said Democratic
pollster Harrison Hickman. ``The angry people are going to take the
time to vote.''

 U.N. Chief Denounces Lack of Action in Rwanda (United Nations) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
UNITED NATIONS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, bristling
with anger and frustration, derided the international community
Wednesday for talking but doing little else to stop genocide in
Rwanda. He denounced the inaction as a scandal.
</P>
<P>
``All of us are responsible for this failure,'' the
secretary-general told a news conference. ``... It is a genocide which
has been committed. More than 200,000 people have been killed, and ...
the international community is still discussing what ought to be done.
</P>
<P>
``I have tried,'' he went on. ``I have been in contact with
different heads of state and begged them to send troops. ...
Unfortunately, let us say with great humility, I failed. It is a
scandal. I am the first one to say it. And I am ready to repeat it.''
</P>
<P>
Although he never singled out the United States for criticism,
Boutros-Ghali mocked the philosophy behind President Clinton's recent
policy directive on peacekeeping. Under this policy, which U.S.
Ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine Albright invoked last week
to force the U.N. Security Council to delay the dispatch of 5,500
troops to Rwanda, the Clinton administration insists that it will not
approve peacekeeping operations until they are subjected to close
scrutiny, including an assessment of their chances for success.
</P>
<P>
But Boutros-Ghali said that ``we must accept that in certain
operations we will not be successful and the fact that you are not
successful in a certain operation must not be an obstacle to
additional operations all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
``It is like going to a hospital,'' he said. ``You cannot say `I
don't want to take this case.' There is a moral responsibility. The
 raison d'etre of this organization is to help member states solve
peacefully their internal disputes and their international disputes.''

<P>
Boutros-Ghali, a 71-year-old former Egyptian diplomat and law
professor, also used the news conference to make what amounted to a
declaration of his intent to seek a second five-year term in 1996.
</P>
<P>
This was a sharp change of course. When he was elected in late
1991, Boutros-Ghali insisted that he intended to serve only one term,
a posture that give him great independence from the five members of
the Security Council who have the power of veto, including the United
States.
</P>
<P>
When asked to justify his change of intent, the secretary-general
told the news conference, ``I believe that only stupid people don't
change their mind.''
</P>
<P>
``The question will be raised in 1996,'' he said, ``and it will
depend on my own physical capacities. If I am feeling in shape, quite
honestly, I will say yes. On the other hand ... if I don't feel well
enough, then I won't request a second term.''
</P>
<P>
Mocking the philosophy behind the Clinton administration's policies
will not help any Boutros-Ghali campaign for a second term. Relations
between the United States and the secretary-general have been tense
for much of the last year. Boutros-Ghali has been angered about the
American attempt to blame him for the debacle in Somalia; the
Americans have been angered by his penchant for setting policy rather
than just taking orders from the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The United States, using its veto, could block a second term for
him.

 Employer-Paid Health Insurance Has Dropped in Last Decade (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The percentage of Americans with employer-paid medical
insurance has dropped sharply in 10 years and the trend is
accelerating, the Clinton administration said Wednesday, as it
released Census Bureau data sure to fuel the health care reform
debate.
</P>
<P>
According to the bureau's employee benefits survey of 30,000
workers, only 61 percent had employer-provided medical coverage, down
from 66 percent in 1983. The rate of decline was steeper among workers
at large companies than those at small ones.
</P>
<P>
``It's not a stable system. Employers are providing less and
less,'' Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said at Capitol Hill news
conference. ``All workers are vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
Such rapid erosion ``makes a very strong case for strengthening the
employer-based system,'' he declared. ``It is time for all employers
to share in this burden.''
</P>
<P>
But opponents used the same data to argue for solutions other than
President Clinton's proposal to force all employers to provide
insurance to workers.
</P>
<P>
``Given those trends, is the employer mandate realistic? Can't we
try some other means to encourage employers to provide benefits,''
said Sharon Canner, a National Association of Manufacturers analyst.
</P>
<P>
The Census data showed that since 1979 coverage has declined from
83 percent to 73 percent of the workforce at companies with 100 or
more workers. Over the same period, coverage declined from 60 percent
to 54 percent at companies with fewer than 100 employees.
</P>
<P>
``This is across the board. This is not solely a small-firm
phenomenon,'' Reich said. ``If anything, large firms are beginning to
get out of the health care business.''
</P>
<P>
He said the data represent ``the most comprehensive view that we've
had yet of workers and coverage.''
</P>
<P>
The president has defended the employer mandate -- the most
controversial element of his reform agenda -- as a conservative
approach that builds on the existing system, noting that the
overwhelming majority of privately insured Americans get their
coverage through the workplace.
</P>
<P>
To achieve his goal of universal coverage, Clinton would require
all employers to pay at least 80 percent of a full-time worker's
premiums, up to a cap of 7.9 percent of total payroll. Small companies
firms with low average payrolls would receive government subsidies,
reducing their ``contribution'' to as little as 3.5 percent of
payroll.
</P>
<P>
The president's bill also would require individual workers to pay
as much as 20 percent of their premiums, or no more than 3.9 percent
of their wages.
</P>
<P>
But many big and small businesses, as well as most congressional
Republicans and even some Democrats, strongly oppose any mandate. So
any significant health care reform will require major compromises on
both sides.
</P>
<P>
Opponents of mandates, such as the Chamber of Commerce and the
National Association of Manufacturers, prefer voluntary incentives and
a gradual extension of coverage to the estimated 38 million uninsured
Americans.
</P>
<P>
Like Clinton, however, they support malpractice reforms,
administrative simplification to reduce costly red tape and insurance
market reforms that ban discriminatory practices against small groups,
particularly people with pre-existing conditions.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
At his news conference, Reich rebutted questions that challenged
the wisdom of building upon a system that even the administration says
is in rapid decline.
</P>
<P>
``This is still a health care system that is premised upon employer
contributions,'' Reich said.
</P>
<P>
That system may be ``ailing,'' he conceded, but it remains ``the
bedrock of America's health care system.''

 Syria Refuses to Commit to Diplomatic Relations, Peres Says (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres complained
Wednesday that Syria has refused to commit itself to full diplomatic
relations and open borders in its peace talks with Israel, and
indicated his government will not withdraw from the Golan Heights for
anything less.
</P>
<P>
Peres, who met with Vice President Al Gore and Secretary of State
Warren Christopher during a visit here, also warned Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat that he risks destroying his self-rule agreement with
Israel by continuing to quibble about its provisions.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with reporters, Peres was asked whether Israel had
committed itself to a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which
was captured by Israeli forces in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
He responded: ``Do the Syrians suggest opening (negotiations) by
having a full-fledged peace with Israel? Do they suggest having a full
arrangement on security? No. They say peace without embassies, without
open frontiers.''
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel have exchanged proposals for a peace agreement,
using Christopher as a go-between, for the past month. Syria has
hinted unofficially that it is willing to consider full peace with
Israel, but has not changed its official position.
</P>
<P>
Peres' statement was the most detailed description of the Syrian
position given by any senior official in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
In January, after meeting with Syrian President Hafez Assad,
President Clinton said the Syrian told him he was ready to seek full
peace, including normal diplomatic relations. But Assad refused to
confirm that in public and said such issues were a matter for
negotiation.
</P>
<P>
Peres also said he considers ``irrelevant'' a statement by Arafat
canceling Israeli laws in Jericho and the Gaza Strip, Palestinian
areas from which Israel has withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
``You cannot sit down, reach an agreement on the declaration of
principles, and then go around and declare different things,'' he
warned.
</P>
<P>
``If you devaluate a word of an agreement, you kill the peaceful
solution,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
``We worked so hard to reach the declaration and the test of the
two sides is to remain true in letter and spirit to the declaration of
principles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Christopher, speaking at the beginning of his meeting with Peres,
said he believes Arafat should reaffirm the commitments he made to
Israel in their agreement on Jericho and Gaza earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
``Commitments have been made. It is very important that they be
lived up to. I think it would be very helpful to have a
reaffirmation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has made several statements that cast doubt on his intention
to remain faithful to the accord, under which Israel agreed to turn
Jericho and Gaza over to the PLO in exchange for assurances that it
would retain ultimate security control over the areas.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Arafat's declaration that Israeli laws are no longer
valid in Palestinian-ruled areas, the PLO leader called in a speech
for a ``jihad'' or holy war to take Jerusalem. He later said that he
was using the word ``jihad'' only in a figurative sense, meaning a
peaceful crusade.

 Russian Organized Crime Groups at Work in U.S., Says FBI Head 
 (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Russian organized crime groups have made substantial
inroads in the United States, engaging in activities such as tax
fraud, insurance scams and drug trafficking, FBI Director Louis Freeh
told a Senate panel Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Freeh said the rapid growth of such groups poses ``a mounting
threat to the safety and well-being'' of Americans, not only from
these crimes but also because the groups could obtain nuclear weapons
materials or a completed nuclear bomb.
</P>
<P>
``Such stolen weapons could be sold potentially to terrorists who
could use them against the United States and other countries,'' Freeh
said. ``We have all been fortunate -- maybe lucky is a better word -- 
that there apparently have been no nuclear thefts so far.''
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that an international probe is under way into a
possible theft from the area of St. Petersburg, Russia, of two
kilograms of highly-enriched uranium capable of being used in a
nuclear weapon. That is less than a third the amount needed to fashion
a crude nuclear device.
</P>
<P>
Freeh's unusually blunt warnings at a hearing of the Governmental
Affairs Permanent Investigations subcommittee prefaced his
announcement that the FBI will soon open its first-ever office in
Moscow, for the purpose of forging anti-crime links with the Russian
law enforcement community.
</P>
<P>
This move -- and Freeh's grim depiction of a new threat to U.S.
security -- come at a time when federal intelligence-gathering and law
enforcement agencies are under pressure to trim their budgets and
develop new missions in the aftermath of the Cold War. Freeh did not
offer many examples of Russian criminal activity abroad but said the
FBI has received a growing number of reports of such action.
</P>
<P>
As part of a new effort to cooperate with a country long regarded
as the FBI's principal nemesis, Freeh said he is willing to begin FBI
training of Russian policemen in organized crimefighting techniques.
He also plans to establish a joint intelligence data base and install
secure communication links to exchange leads on organized crime
groups.
</P>
<P>
Details of the new cooperation are to be discussed when Freeh
travels to Moscow next month with senior officials of the Treasury
Department, State Department and the Drug Enforcement Administration.
Freeh said the ``template'' for such cooperation is a 1981 arrangement
with Italy that has sent hundreds of Mafiosi to prison in both
nations.
</P>
<P>
Seated near Freeh at the hearing was the top Russian official
charged with fighting organized crime, First Deputy Minister of the
Interior Mikhail K. Yegorov, who confirmed and enlarged on Freeh's
grim warnings about the threat to Americans.
</P>
<P>
According to information reaching Moscow, Yegorov said, 24 Russian
organized crime groups are operating on U.S. territory, principally in
San Francisco, Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago and New York. He said they
engage in ``money laundering, illegal money transactions, and
narcotics,'' with assistance from emigres now living in America.
</P>
<P>
Freeh said FBI probes of ``Russian/Eurasian'' organized crime and
racketeering had increased from 13 in 1992 to 35 early this year. He
said, for example, that the FBI had evidence Russian emigres were
working with La Cosa Nostra organizations to control the illegal,
untaxed sale of 50 million gallons of gasoline a month, costing the
Treasury $7 million a month.
</P>
<P>
Profits from the scheme were funneled to import-export firms
conducting business in Eurasia and to an organized crime figure in
Moscow, Freeh said. He added that 18 individuals and three companies
have pleaded guilty to the fraud, including two people hunted down in
Russia and returned to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Freeh also noted that a Russian emigre affiliated with an organized
crime group operating in the Baltic States was convicted three years
ago in a medical insurance billing scheme that netted $50 million. He
said FBI data ``clearly indicates'' Russian emigres are laundering
millions of U.S. dollars ``that originated as rubles'' and in some
cases stemmed from criminal activities.
</P>
<P>
According to Yegorov, the United States is not alone in providing
fertile ground for Russian criminals. He said 47 organized groups are
operating in Germany and 60 groups in Italy, often banding together
with local criminals to commit extortion, fraud or provide a conduit
to the West for narcotics from Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
Yegorov said that during the past 18 months, his organization had
investigated 47 criminal cases involving radioactive materials,
including nine alleged thefts of highly-enriched materials of the sort
needed for nuclear weapons. Only one such theft involved ``organized
crime groups,'' he said, adding nonetheless that this danger should be
taken more seriously.
</P>
<P>
Hans-Ludwig Zachert, the president of Germany's Federal Criminal
Police, also underscored Freeh's warnings about the potential for
trade in nuclear materials from the former Soviet Union and eastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Zachert told the Senate panel his organization in 1992 investigated
18 such alleged thefts. Weapons-grade materials were offered for sale
in several of the cases, although none was found. Two cases
investigated in 1993 involved attempts by eastern Europeans to extort
money by threatening the use of nuclear arms against Germany or
Austria.

 Clinton Defends Bosnia Policy During Commencement Address (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Clinton used commencement at the U.S. Naval
Academy as a platform Wednesday for a sharp counterattack on his
Bosnia policy, accusing critics -- including many leaders of his own
party -- of advancing ``simplistic ideas that sound good on bumper
stickers but that would have tragic consequences.''
</P>
<P>
The administration's policy, which relies heavily on multinational
consultations and which critics deride as a failure to assert U.S.
leadership, ``is not quick; it is not neat; it is not comfortable,''
Clinton conceded during his speech in Annapolis, Md. ``But I am
convinced in a world of interdependence where we must lead by working
with others, it is the right path.
</P>
<P>
``Our administration will not walk away from this Bosnian conflict.
But we will not embrace solutions that are wrong,'' Clinton said. ``We
plan to continue the course we have chosen -- raising the price on
those who pursue aggression, helping to provide relief to the
suffering, and working with our partners in Europe to move the parties
to a workable agreement.''
</P>
<P>
In particular, Clinton denounced proposals that the United States
unilaterally violate the U.N. embargo against arms shipments to the
warring parties in Bosnia -- a course of action many leading Democrats
have endorsed and that enjoys substantial support in Congress.
</P>
<P>
Although Clinton has made that point several times before, his
sharpened rhetoric marked an escalation of the war of words over
Bosnia policy. The move reflects a realization by White House
officials that Clinton needs to take a more active role in defending
his foreign policies.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also repeated his insistence that Congress not make further
cuts in the defense budget, an idea congressional liberals have
revived as lawmakers begin to face the hard choices on spending forced
this year by tight budget caps.
</P>
<P>
In addition to his Bosnia policy, Clinton also defended his overall
approach of emphasizing multilateral action in most foreign arenas.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's critics, including several potential Republican
presidential hopefuls, have claimed that he has devalued traditional
U.S. leadership by refusing to act alone when necessary.
</P>
<P>
But, Clinton said, while the United States must act unilaterally
when its own immediate interests are at stake, many world crises
require international cooperation instead.
</P>
<P>
``The end of the superpower standoff lifted the lid from a cauldron
of long-simmering hatreds,'' he said. ``Now the entire global terrain
is bloody with such conflicts, from Rwanda to Georgia.
</P>
<P>
``We cannot solve every such outburst of civil strive or militant
nationalism simply by sending in our forces. We cannot turn away from
them. But our interests are not sufficiently at stake in so many of
them to justify a commitment of our folks.''
</P>
<P>
In Bosnia, for example, Clinton said, the United States has
interests at stake. They are not weighty enough to ``warrant our
unilateral involvement, but they do demand that we help to lead a way
to a workable peace agreement if one can be achieved.''
</P>
<P>
Multilateral action in such cases ``preserves our leadership,
preserves our treasure and commits our forces in the proper way.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Until recently, Clinton advisers tended to shy away from having the
president defend his positions on foreign issues, feeling that the
public would resent Clinton for spending time on overseas issues
rather than on domestic policies.
</P>
<P>
But the administration's mood on that issue has shifted recently as
polls have shown that public uncertainty about Clinton's policies has
begun dragging down voters' overall assessment of his ability. Because
of that, officials increasingly have urged Clinton to explain and
defend his policies more actively -- a challenge that will absorb much
of Clinton's time during his visit to Europe that begins next week.
</P>
<P>
The arms embargo has been a particularly difficult issue for the
White House because Clinton agrees with critics who say the main
impact of the embargo has been to prevent Bosnian government forces
from obtaining enough weapons to defend themselves against Serb rebels
who receive arms through the neighboring Serbian republic. Clinton has
intermittently, and unsuccessfully, tried to convince U.S. allies to
agree that it should be lifted.
</P>
<P>
The administration's inability to convince Britain, France and
Russia -- each of which has a veto in the U.N. Security Council -- to
agree to lifting the embargo has led many members of both parties to
call on Clinton to abrogate the ban unilaterally.

 Congressional Losses Underscore Democrats' Vulnerability 
 In Midterm Elections, Analysts Say 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Back-to-back congressional losses underscore the Democrats'
vulnerability in this fall's midterm elections and could foreshadow
significant Republican gains in the South, analysts in both parties
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Republican officials quickly capitalized on their easy victory
Tuesday in the Kentucky Congressional District held for 41 years by
the late William H. Natcher, D, and an earlier win in a
Democratic-held district in Oklahoma, claiming the races showed
growing public dissatisfaction with President Clinton and the
Democrats who control Congress.
</P>
<P>
``I think what we just did is a test run in Oklahoma and
Kentucky,'' said House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, R-Ga. ``Morale and
momentum and therefore resources are shifting our way and Democrats
are disoriented and don't want to defend Clinton and can't run away
from him.''
</P>
<P>
But Clinton, in a private meeting with House Democrats, said the
administration has much to be proud of and urged members to ``take
credit for this stuff and don't sit back on your heels,'' according to
one Democrat who attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also sharply attacked Republicans as ``fanatics'' who are
peddling a message of ``hate and fear'' and said they are ``fooling
themselves'' if they believe the Kentucky race is indicative of how
Democrats will fare this fall.
</P>
<P>
Democratic National Committee Chairman David Wilhelm blamed the
Kentucky defeat on a candidate ``who got in a defensive crouch and
stayed there.''
</P>
<P>
But other Democrats, while cautioning that special elections are
often poor predictors of later contests, were more pessimistic,
especially in their private comments. They said Clinton is likely to
be an issue in many marginal races in the South.
</P>
<P>
Even Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., who chairs the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee and who echoed Wilhelm's analysis of
the Kentucky race, warned that the Republicans could rack up big gains
this fall.
</P>
<P>
Fazio called the Kentucky race unique, but said it nonetheless may
serve ``as a wake-up call'' to the party. ``I've been talking about
our potential of losing up to 25 seats and I've been very serious
about it.''
</P>
<P>
The Kentucky election left the Democrats holding a 257-to-178
advantage in the House, along with their 56-to-44 margin in the
Senate. A gain of even 15 House seats would give Republicans their
largest number since the mid-1950s and greater gains could cost
Democrats their working majority. Working control of the Senate is
also threatened by the recently announced retirements of Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and Sen. David Boren,
D-Okla.
</P>
<P>
The party that holds the White House generally loses House seats in
midterm elections. But the Democrats' historical disadvantage is
compounded this year by a variety of factors. They include voter anger
toward Washington, Democratic retirements in marginal House districts,
the effects of redistricting and Clinton's unpopularity in the South.
</P>
<P>
Republican strategist Whit Ayres said the two special House races,
combined with last year's string of Republican victories ``send a very
clear message, that voters around the country, and particularly voters
in the South, are very unhappy with the leadership provided by
President Clinton and the Democrats in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
Clinton's popularity varies from region to region and a White House
official said many Democrats are anxious for his help this year. But
the danger for House Democrats in districts where Clinton's
favorability ratings are weak is most apparent in the 28 open seats
where Democratic incumbents have announced their retirements or are
seeking higher office.
</P>
<P>
In 17 of the 28 districts, Clinton's vote in 1992 was below his
national average of 43 percent, and in 11 of those districts, most of
them in the South, George Bush beat Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Republican pollster Bill McInturff said that, in the South, the
Clinton administration is facing growing hostility.
</P>
<P>
``In focus groups, there is an historic anti-governemnt
sentiment,'' McInturff said. ``What they see Clinton doing, on taxes,
the economy, health care, these are seen as symbols of Jimmy Carter,
round two. The guy is raising taxes and overreaching the role of
government.''
</P>
<P>
Emory political scientist Merle Black, who has specialized in the
study of Southern politics, said, ``Clinton is not an asset in most
Southern congressional districts'' and predicted Republican candidates
would mimic the kind of campaign Republican Ron Lewis ran in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
Lewis ran an explicitly anti-Clinton campaign that included one
television ad in which the face of Democrat Joe Prather turned into
the face of Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
``I wouldn't be too surprised to see that ad in 200 districts in
October,'' Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
``I hope so,'' responded presidential pollster Stan Greenberg. ``I
think people will vote for change rather than negativism and a return
to the Reagan-Bush years.''
</P>
<P>
Greenberg and other Democrats said it's too early to make
predictions about November, despite the losses in Kentucky and
Oklahoma, and that the outcome of the health-care debate could become
a major factor in the fall.
</P>
<P>
``I don't think the story of the off-year elections is going to be
decided until October,'' he said. ``People are going to make a
decision of whether we're moving the country forward or whether we're
stuck. And right now, they don't know.''
</P>
<P>
But Republican pollster Linda Divall said many voters are still
angry with Washington. She said the special-election results were not
just a vote against Clinton. ``It was also a warning signal that the
changes voters cast their votes for in 1992 have not come about and
they are still frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
She and others noted the continued intense anger over congressional
check bouncing, and argued that almost any outcome in the pending
criminal case of Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., will damage Congress
and the Democrats. ``Any plea bargain is going to look very bad,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
Democrats worry that low voter turnout, which occurred in Kentucky,
will hurt their candidates this fall. ``The people on the outs are
much more motivated to vote than our people are,'' said Democratic
pollster Harrison Hickman. ``The angry people are going to take the
time to vote.''

 Harry Houdini's Grave Site Vandalized (New York) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vandals hit Machpelah Cemetery in New York City where
Harry Houdini is buried, knocking over several tombstones and
destroying two carved sandstone benches at the magician's grave site,
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Houdini's tombstone escaped damage but two hand-carved, priceless
stone benches were destroyed, said David Jacobson, who heads the
cemetery, in the borough of Queens. ``They were smashed, they're
irreplacable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
In the 67 years Houdini has been buried in Machpelah, vandalism has
not been uncommon. Originally the tombstone was topped by a bust of
the magician. But after the theft of the first bust and two
replacements, those responsible for maintenance of the grave site
decided the busts' disappearing act was too costly to go on.

 Clinton Defends Foreign Policy at Academy Commencement (Annapolis) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ANNAPOLIS, Md.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a preview of themes he will strike during next
week's European tour, President Clinton Wednesday defended his foreign
policy in general and his approach to Bosnia in particular against
critics with ``simplistic ideas that sound good on bumper stickers but
that would have tragic consequences.''
</P>
<P>
The president used a commencement address at the U.S. Naval Academy
to deliver his most extensive explanation to date of the circumstances
under which he would send American troops into harm's way -- and made
it clear they weren't likely to include ``ethnic and religious
conflicts'' like those raging in Rwanda and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
``The end of the superpower standoff lifted the lid from a cauldron
of long-simmering hatreds,'' he told a sweltering football stadium
filled with graduating midshipmen and their proud families. ``We
cannot solve every such outburst of civil strife or militant
nationalism simply by sending in our forces. We cannot turn away from
them, but our interests are not sufficiently at stake in so many of
them to justify a commitment of our folks.''
</P>
<P>
The speech was the first in a series of presidential addresses tied
to next week's celebration in Europe of the 50th anniversary of D-Day,
the amphibious assault on the Normandy beaches that turned the tide in
World War II. The White House is approaching Clinton's eight-day trip
to Italy, England and France eager to bolster his credentials, now
under increasing fire, on foreign and defense issues.
</P>
<P>
Clinton outlined relatively limited circumstances under which he
would commit U.S. forces, saying he would do so ``to defend our land
and our people'' and ``to protect our vital interests.'' During the
1992 campaign, he had advocated more decisive U.S. action in places
like Bosnia and Haiti, but he has tempered those views since taking
office -- especially since the debacle in Somalia last year that cost
American lives.
</P>
<P>
In Bosnia and elsewhere, he said, the United States should work
with other nations -- and be prepared to not always call the shots
about how to proceed. He singled out for rebuke calls by Congress to
unilaterally break the U.N. arms embargo for Bosnian Muslims. While
Clinton personally supports lifting the embargo, Britain and France,
which have troops on the ground there, oppose it.
</P>
<P>
``We simply must not opt for options and action that sound simple
and painless and good, but which will not work in this era of
interdependence where it is important that we leverage American
influence and leadership by proving that we can work with others,'' he
said, ``especially when others have greater and more immediate stakes
and are willing to put their soldiers in harm's way.''
</P>
<P>
The Senate this month passed a bill that would require Clinton to
lift the embargo unilaterally, though it also passed a contradictory
provision instructing him to consult with NATO allies first. Advocates
of lifting the ban tried to force a House vote on the issue Tuesday,
but Democratic leaders postponed it until after Clinton returns from
the D-Day trip.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Clinton referred to two recent controversies that
have rocked the Navy -- the Tailhook affair and a cheating scandal that
led to the expulsion of 24 academy midshipmen last month. ``These are
troubling events, to be sure, because our military rests on honor and
leadership,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Then he made a comment that echoed an argument put forward by those
defending Clinton himself against attacks on his character.
</P>
<P>
``But, ultimately, the test of leadership is not constant
flawlessness,'' he said. ``Rather, it is marked by a commitment to
continue always to strive for the highest standards, to learn honestly
when one falls short, and to do the right thing when it happens.''

 Shortages Driving Up the Price of Coffee Beans 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like someone who's had too many cups, world coffee markets are
wired these days with the price of beans rocketing higher, thanks to
worsening shortages in Colombia, Brazil and the other big coffee
producing nations.
</P>
<P>
The commodity price of whole, unroasted beans has roughly doubled
since last summer, with the latest surge occurring in the past week.
And coffee experts say prices could double again before it's over.
</P>
<P>
The dramatic rise -- which was predicted long ago by coffee growing
nations as the inevitable result of the collapse of an international
cartel in 1989 -- is described as chiefly a cyclical response to the
woefully low prices that prevailed just a year ago.
</P>
<P>
When prices tumble, as they did steadily from 1989 to 1993, growers
save money by skimping on fertilizers and other agricultural
practices, opening the door to crop disease and infestations that can
slash the size of crops for years. Shortages follow, bidding prices
back up.
</P>
<P>
That and this season's late Indonesian harvest had more to do with
the surge in prices than did a recent scheme by 28 coffee-growing
nations to withhold beans from the market, says Judith Ganes, a coffee
analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York.
</P>
<P>
As production fell and consumption remained flat, estimated
stockpiles have tumbled by half, says Ganes, triggering a classic
supply-demand reaction in prices.
</P>
<P>
As recently as last July, the average world price of a pound of
green, or unroasted, coffee beans stood at 52 cents. On Wednesday, the
price stood at $1.28 a pound. Analyst Ganes predicts the price will
exceed $2 within four months.
</P>
<P>
``What matters right now is there aren't enough beans, and the
growers won't be able to recoup before 1995 or 1996,'' says Ganes. ``I
think the bull market is just starting.''
</P>
<P>
Though good news for those members of the lately toothless coffee
growers' cartel that have beans to sell, it spells trouble for
coffee's ``Big Three'' -- Procter Gamble, Kraft/General Foods and
Nestle's -- as they struggle to hold the line on retail prices and
limit the further loss of customers to pricey, higher-quality gourmet
blends.
</P>
<P>
General Foods, which distributed the Folgers brand, has raised its
price to grocers by 25 percent, but there has been no ripple effect
yet in what consumers pay. Whether that occurs will depend partly on
the marketing strategies of the coffee roasters and peddlers, says Tom
Pirko, president of Santa Barbara, Calif.-based Bevmark Inc., an
international beverage consulting company.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Pirko described the high-volume roasters -- purveyors of such name
brands as Folger's and Maxwell House -- as plagued by razor-thin profit
margins. They have held the line on prices to hang on to customers who
might otherwise opt for the gourmet coffees.
</P>
<P>
If the makers of the cheaper canned coffees decide to raise retail
prices to avoid losses, Pirko said, the trendy gourmet companies
typified by Seattle-based Starbucks could grab still more market share
by keeping current prices and foregoing some of the generous profit
margins they now enjoy.
</P>
<P>
``The question is, are they smart enough to know that?'' Pirko
said. ``Their margins are enormous. They could absorb much bigger
(green bean price) increases than we've seen so far.''

 Derivative Regulations Called Unnecessary (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wall Street's hottest trading instruments may pose
some risks to the financial system, but Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan and other top regulators told Congress Wednesday that
tougher laws over financial ``derivatives'' are unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
Their opposition dims chances that Congress will pass a bill to
stiffen regulation of derivatives this term.
</P>
<P>
The regulators' reluctance comes despite last week's release of a
two-year report on derivatives by the General Accounting Office that
detected ``regulatory gaps'' and called for aggressive reforms, some
of which would require legislation.
</P>
<P>
While commending the GAO for its work, Greenspan and Securities and
Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. played down the
report's warning that recent multimillion-dollar losses at U.S.
companies and investment firms were signs of more danger ahead.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's hearing before the House subcommittee on Energy and
Commerce chaired by Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., highlighted
Washington's continuing inability to get its arms around the
fast-growing $12 trillion derivatives business.
</P>
<P>
Companies and speculators use derivatives both to make money on
trading bets and to protect the value of their other investments from
unexpected changes.
</P>
<P>
Unlike stocks, derivative contracts do not entitle holders to any
stake in a business or its profits. They instead let holders bet on
the movement of stock prices and other securities. When indicators
move in expected directions, like interest rates did recently,
companies holding derivatives contracts can lose money.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan pooh-poohed fears that the recent corporate losses are
the first of many to come.
</P>
<P>
``It would be wrong to draw sweeping conclusions from these
events,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
The ``unintended consequences'' of tougher U.S. regulation might be
that derivatives would simply be struck overseas where laws were more
lenient, making efforts by U.S. regulators to supervise derivatives
more difficult.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan and Levitt argued against the GAO's proposal to give the
SEC power over the securities firms' affiliates that trade
derivatives, which are now unregulated. The GAO recommends SEC
regulatory authority akin to what the Federal Reserve has over the
derivative units of commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Legislating SEC oversight of derivatives would lessen regulatory
``flexibility,'' according to the Fed chairman. He said the
derivatives market was growing so fast that today's regulation would
be outmoded tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Levitt mainly agreed with Greenspan but said he would seek
legislation in the fall if his efforts to work with Wall Street to
lessen the risks of derivatives failed.
</P>
<P>
But he ruled out mandating procedures for how dealers and companies
manage the risks associated with derivatives, a GAO proposal that is
hated by Wall Street and business lobbying groups.
</P>
<P>
Markey, who has announced he plans to introduce derivative-related
legislation, said he was disappointed by the regulators' response. He
ended the hearing by saying he will soon hold hearings on specific
cases in which derivatives caused large losses.
</P>
<P>
When a derivative contract is struck between two parties -- like a
bank and a corporation -- each side agrees to make payments to the
other for some period of time, say, five years. How much money each
side pays depends on events in the securities markets. Each side's
payment obligation ``derives'' from price changes in such underlying
securities as stocks, bonds, foreign exchange and commodities.

Warner Bros. might see it as just good fun and box-office receipts,
but the Consumer Product Safety Commission isn't laughing.
</P>
<P>
The federal regulatory agency has strongly warned Warner that
safety procedures better be followed in scenes where child star
Macaulay Culkin zooms around on a controversial all-terrain vehicle
(ATV) in the upcoming ``Richie Rich.''
</P>
<P>
And it is the appearance of safety that also has the agency
concerned. It might not be apparent on screen, for example, that
13-year-old Culkin's driving is being supervised by adults -- or that
he's not speeding. ``Kids don't know the difference between reality
and the movies,'' Ann Brown, chairman of the CPSC, tells us. ``When
they see a role model appearing to drive around unsafely, that sets a
bad example.''
</P>
<P>
Added CPSC General Counsel Eric Rubel,
</P>
<P>
``We want to make sure an adult is in the scene -- otherwise the
wrong impression is left.''
</P>
<P>
The scene was shot recently, and a spokesman for Warner said
Wednesday night that the company ``did its best to meet the guidelines
suggested by the commission.'' Although the spokeswoman said Culkin
wore a helmet and did not drive wildly or on pavement, she would not
address the appearance issue. The CPSC claims the recreational
vehicles have been responsible for more than 2,000 deaths in the past
decade, nearly 900 of which were drivers under 16.
</P>
<P>
The CPSC actually has no enforcement authority over Warner. But,
according to Rubel, it is studying whether it could expand its
jurisdiction on the grounds that films are consumer products.

 Party Leader Rips Democrats for Ignoring Clinton Record (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Democratic National Chairman David Wilhelm on
Wednesday denounced Democratic candidates, including the loser in this
week's special House election in Kentucky, for not running on
President Clinton's record.
</P>
<P>
``The lesson here is that Democrats should run as Democrats,''
Wilhelm said, speaking of the loss Tuesday of a House seat in Kentucky
held by Democrats for 129 years. The defeat spurred increased concern
among Democrats and enthusiasm in Republican circles about prospects
in the fall elections.
</P>
<P>
The election results and Wilhelm's criticism underlined a problem
that Democratic congressional candidates will have to face in November
as a result of their party's conquest of the White House in 1992.
During the 12 years of the Reagan-Bush presidencies Democratic
candidates could tailor their campaigns to suit local tastes with
minimal concern about the national party.
</P>
<P>
But now they have to answer for Clinton's policies, too, and this
could be a heavy burden, especially in the South and other
conservative areas where the president and his policies are not
popular.
</P>
<P>
In off-year elections, the party controlling the White House
traditionally loses seats in the House, where the Democrats hold a
256-178 majority. But professionals in both parties said circumstances
of the Kentucky contest suggested that House Democrats this year face
a particularly difficult predicament.
</P>
<P>
Adding to their burden is the gradual but steady realignment of the
South's congressional districts, which have long been dominated by
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
The Kentucky special election to replace the late Rep. William H.
Natcher was won by Republican Ron Lewis, a minister and owner of a
fundamentalist book store who received 55 percent of the vote to 45
percent for Democrat Joe Prather, a former state legislator.
</P>
<P>
A distant underdog at the start of the campaign, Lewis benefited
from an infusion of campaign funds and advice from the national party,
and from a zealous organizing effort by conservative Christians. He
centered his campaign on linking Prather to Clinton, even running a
television commercial that depicted Clinton's face blending into
Prather's.
</P>
<P>
``If you like Bill Clinton, you'll love Joe Prather,'' the
announcer declared.
</P>
<P>
In a district former President Bush carried against Clinton in
1992, Prather concluded he should keep his distance from Clinton and
from the national party, refusing financial support or any other type
of help.
</P>
<P>
But he was so preoccupied with warding off Lewis's attack, other
Democrats charged, he failed to develop a positive message of his own.
</P>
<P>
``As best I can tell, Joe Prather got into a defensive crouch and
stayed there,'' Wilhelm told a Washington news conference.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Wilhelm claimed the same strategy was followed in the last year by
unsuccessful Democratic candidates Bob Kreuger, who ran for U.S.
Senate in Texas, and Virginia gubernatorial nominee Mary Sue Terry.
Wilhelm said that approach ``is a dead bang loser,'' because ``it
allows your opponent to define you and causes Democrats to stay at
home in droves.''
</P>
<P>
Wilhelm contended that Lewis and other Democrats would be better
off running on the president's record. They should be ``proud of
deficit reduction, proud of (creating) 3 million jobs,'' and should
not ``pretend as if you were in a different party or your president
was somebody else,'' he said
</P>
<P>
But some independent analysts and Democratic consultants rejected
Wilhelm's argument.
</P>
<P>
``Right now the president is not seen as an asset'' in many
Southern districts, said Merle Black, Emory University specialist on
Southern politics. Democratic candidates in those districts ``are
stuck with Clinton and he has given them an unpopular agenda.''

 Hubble Confirms Massive Black Hole's Existence (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hubble Space Telescope has confirmed for the first
time the existence of a supermassive black hole, ending a decades-long
quest for definitive proof, astronomers announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The orbiting observatory, with corrective lenses installed during a
repair mission last December, for the first time was able to see
clearly into the heart of the giant galaxy M87, more than 50 million
light-years away in the constellation Virgo, where astronomers have
long suspected a monstrous black hole has lurking.
</P>
<P>
The telescope revealed the details there so sharply that the
observing team was able to ``weigh'' the object at the galaxy's center
with unexpected ease, the astronomers said. The key was a
pancake-shaped disk of hot gas spinning around, and being consumed, by
something at the center. Measurements of its velocity showed that the
central object has a mass 2 billion to 3 billion times the mass of the
sun, compressed into an area about the size of our solar system.
</P>
<P>
``If that isn't a black hole, I don't know what it is,'' said
Holland Ford of Johns Hopkins University and the Space Telescope
Science Institute in Baltimore. He and Richard Harms of Applied
Research Corp. in Landover, Md., led the observing team and announced
the findings Wednesday at NASA headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The concept of a black hole was built, at first, purely on
mathematical equations and imaginings of theorists. They envisioned a
massive, collapsing object (a star or group of stars) whose
gravitational pull is so powerful that nothing -- not even light -- can
come out again after it has crossed the hole's threshold, known as the
``event horizon.'' Within this singular object, normal time and space
come to a halt. The known laws of physics do not apply.
</P>
<P>
Everything trapped inside that one-way membrane, lost forever to
the rest of the universe, is by definition invisible -- detectable only
by the violent and flamboyant energy of material on the verge of being
consumed.
</P>
<P>
The immense gravity of the black hole draws all nearby objects and
material toward it, forming a whirlpool (called an ``accretion disk'')
that resembles water going down the bathtub drain. In this maelstrom,
matter crowds in, collides, heats up and forms what Hubble saw as a
pancake of gas around the hole, with high-speed jets of gas spewing
from the disk near one or both ``poles'' of the hole.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, increasingly sophisticated instruments gradually
have piled up convincing evidence that these objects exist. But, Ford
said, ``Skeptical colleagues were always clever enough to create
computer models showing that some other explanation was possible.''
</P>
<P>
Now, said Bruce Margon of the University of Washington, ``We no
longer have an alternative theory.''
</P>
<P>
``All reasonable astronomers will be convinced'' said NASA
astronomer Stephen Maran of Goddard Space Flight Center, who is also a
spokesman for the American Astronomical Society.
</P>
<P>
The ``smoking gun'' proof presented Wednesday was the measurement
of the astounding velocity in the whirling disk of gas as it was
sucked inward by the powerful gravity of the hole: At a distance of 60
light years out, it was whipping around at 1.2 million miles per hour.
(A light year is about 5.8 trillion miles).
</P>
<P>
``Once you get that measurement, all you need is straightforward
Newtonian physics to calculate the mass of the central object that's
making the disk spin,'' says Harms. In a similar way, astronomers have
measured the motions of the planets to determine the sun's mass.
</P>
<P>
M87 is a giant football-shaped collection of up to a trillion
stars. It has fascinated astronomers since early in the century, when
they detected a jet of hot ionized gas at least 4,000 light years long
shooting from its core. Such a jet is now thought to be one signature
of a black hole. The new observations show that the disk of whirling
gas is positioned at a right angle to the jet, just as predicted.
</P>
<P>
Theorist Edwin E. Salpeter of Cornell University, after seeing the
new Hubble data, said, ``A black hole is now the least crazy model for
what we're seeing.'' Thirty years ago, Salpeter and a Russian
astronomer independently wrote papers essentially predicting
Wednesday's findings. ``It's good to finally win the bet,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
Recent observations indicate that black holes may come in a variety
of sizes and may live at the cores of many galaxies, including Earth's
home galaxy, the Milky Way. If Earth itself could collapse into a
black hole, one astronomer suggested, it would be compressed to the
size of a child's marble. It there were material nearby for it to
consume, the feeding frenzy would produce as much radiation as the
sun.
</P>
<P>
In fact, recent observations indicate that these powerhouses may be
commonplace in the universe, existing in all sizes and throughout
time.

 Chemical-Warfare Agents Are Likely Cause of Some Cases 
 Of `Gulf War Syndrome,' Senate Panel Reports (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Poisoning by chemical-warfare agents is a likely cause
of at least some cases of ``Gulf War syndrome,'' the illness that may
afflict more than 10,000 veterans of the Persian Gulf War against
Iraq, according to a Senate committee report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials, testifying before the Senate Banking Committee
Wednesday, said that even though they have no evidence of gas attacks
during the Gulf War, as-yet-unproved contact with chemical- or
biological-warfare agents remains on the long list of possible causes
of the mysterious malady.
</P>
<P>
The 151-page report, prepared largely by the staff of Sen. Donald
W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich, who chairs the committee, builds a case for
low-concentration exposure to chemical agents at levels below those
causing mass death or unequivocal detection by mechanical sensors. The
cluster of symptoms -- which include fatigue, concentration problems,
joint pains and skin rashes -- are ``consistent with'' chronic exposure
to these agents, particularly nerve gas, Riegle argued.
</P>
<P>
``I think the facts are now inescapable that (chemical-weapons
exposure) is a significant amount of this problem,'' Riegle said
during a day-long hearing. ``If the defense department is incapable of
seeing this ... the problem is going to get a lot worse.''
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Department of Defense and the Central
Intelligence Agency each testified they had no convincing evidence -- 
either from physical or intelligence sources -- that chemical or
biological weapons had been used during the Gulf War. Under
confrontational questioning by Riegle, however, no one was willing to
absolutely guarantee that no exposure had occurred.
</P>
<P>
``The intelligence community has an expression: ``Absence of
evidence is not evidence of absence','' said John T. Kriese, chief
officer for ground forces at the Defense Intelligence Agency. ``I
cannot say there was no CW (chemical warfare) use or BW (biological
warfare) contamination. From everything I know, my judgment is that it
was not used. (But) I think it's impossible to prove a negative.''
</P>
<P>
The reports of chemical-weapon contact that the U.S. military finds
most credible were two made by Czech soldiers in mid-January 1991.
</P>
<P>
In the first, a gas alarm near the Port of Jubayl sounded and
subsequent chemical testing demonstrated the presence of saran, a
nerve gas. Several days later, soldiers detected liquid mustard agent
in a small patch of desert sand near King Khalid Military City.
</P>
<P>
American officials reviewed the chemical records, spoke to the
soldiers and found these reports credible. But because no gas or sand
samples were kept, independent confirmation of the Czech findings
wasn't possible.
</P>
<P>
Riegle's office last September released a preliminary investigation
of alleged gas attacks during the Gulf War. His staff extensively
interviewed soldiers who believed they were gassed. The new report
contains narratives of 16 of these events, which are often
characterized by missile attacks followed by gas alarms, strange
smells and various symptoms in the minutes before soldiers were fully
suited in their protective gear.
</P>
<P>
The report, which also carries the name of the banking committee's
ranking minority member, Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato, R-N.Y., contains
details about chemical agents and sensing devices, a list of Iraq's
purchases of bacteria and viruses from American sellers in the 1980s
(when Iraq was fighting Iran); other possible causes of Gulf War
syndrome; and theories to explain some of the many unanswered
questions about the illness.
</P>
<P>
Much of Wednesday's hearing consisted of speculation by witnesses
and interrogators about what scenarios -- in the absence of proof -- are
least likely to be true.
</P>
<P>
Riegle theorized that gas was released into the atmosphere after
the bombing of Iraqi munitions dumps. It then drifted over coalition
troops in concentrations that were undetectable, or only marginally
detectable.
</P>
<P>
Kriese responded: ``The question is -- where are the very sick
people, the people with very high exposure?'' After studying aerial
photographs taken after bombing runs, ``we found no evidence of the
deaths we would expect from local release of large amounts of
material.''
</P>
<P>
There were about 1,400 chemical-sensor alarms among American
troops. Gulf War veterans said many of these went off repeatedly and
often during reported (and sometimes disputed) incoming SCUD missile
attacks. Virtually none of the more sensitive devices used after these
alarms sound confirmed the presence of gas. The military has concluded
that essentially all the alarms were false alarms.
</P>
<P>
``No answers are being found as to where this body of sick veterans
came from,'' said Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah. ``To say all the
explosions were sonic booms and all the alarms were false alarms and
all the illness is coming from some other source is just not going to
cut it.''
</P>
<P>
Riegle was especially concerned about reports that some spouses of
ailing Gulf veterans have also developed symptoms, including
reproductive problems, and that some children may also be affected. No
one theorized how transmission of low concentrations of chemical
agents might be possible months after contamination and thousands of
miles away.

 Era Ends as Historic Hughes Aircraft Plant Closes (Culver City) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
CULVER CITY, Calif.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Closing a celebrated chapter in aerospace
history, the aircraft plant where Howard Hughes built the Spruce Goose
five decades ago was scheduled to shut down Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas Corp. has built helicopter parts in the plant's
cavernous centerpiece, Building 15, since buying Hughes Aircraft Co.'s
helicopter line in 1984. But McDonnell has been shifting that work in
recent years to its main helicopter site in Mesa, Ariz., and its
roughly 50 production workers still in Culver City are calling its
quits when the final shift ends at 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
``It's very sad for me, although all of us had known it was
coming,'' said Betty Percival, who's spent 21 years at the plant in
administrative posts. ``I almost wish I hadn't seen this part. On the
other hand, I wouldn't have left earlier.''
</P>
<P>
Hughes began construction of the plant in 1941, and completed
Building 15 in 1943 to accommodate construction of the Spruce Goose,
an enormous wooden craft that was also known as the HK-1 Hercules
Flying Boat and remains the biggest airplane ever built. More than two
dozen other structures eventually were added to the 260-acre site.
</P>
<P>
Some of the buildings -- including one that served as Howard Hughes'
private apartment -- already are empty and the plant's 4,500-space
parking lot is dotted with weeds. Hughes Aircraft's original
headquarters, once famed for its mahogany trimmed walls, also sits
vacant and rotting 18 years after the billionaire's death.
</P>
<P>
McDonnell's main administrative building on the plant is like a
ghost town, its dozens of drab offices empty of people and telephones.
Hundreds of typewriters, personal computers, desk lamps and chairs
that once filled those rooms were auctioned off earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The factory floor in Building 15 is filled with idle metal stamping
machines, drills, hydraulic presses and welding bays. Some are being
put in crates for shipment to Arizona. Above, an enormous American
flag still hangs from the building's rafters.
</P>
<P>
The plant, which once employed as many as 8,000 people, won't be
entirely vacated until the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Hughes Aircraft still inhabits two buildings at the site, where 700
workers make high-tech display screens for police cars and other
electronic gear. But both McDonnell and Hughes are tenants on the
property, with leases expiring at end of 1994, and Hughes said its
employees will leave by then as well.
</P>
<P>
The property is part of a massive development project, that will
transform the site into a community with housing, offices, stores and
hotels.
</P>
<P>
What happens to the plant now?
</P>
<P>
Nelson Rising, a senior partner at Maguire Thomas Partners, the
developer, said the first phase calls for leaving the buildings there
 -- probably for at least five years -- and possibly leasing them to new
tenants. .
</P>
<P>
Eventually, ``the overall master plan calls for those (buildings)
to be replaced as the market dictates,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
But R.D. ``Rod'' Ayers, a plant manager who arrived there in 1969,
said that it would be a shame to tear down Building 15. It ``is a
historical site,'' Ayers said. ``The biggest aircraft in the whole
world was built right in that building over there.''
</P>
<P>
The plant's demise does end an unique era, because everything about
the facility reinforced Howard Hughes' legend as a bigger-than-life
innovator.
</P>
<P>
Building 15, as long as 2½ football fields and its ceiling eight
stories high, was thought to be the world's largest wooden structure
when it was finished, according to Hal Klopper, a McDonnell public
relations official and the plant's unofficial historian.
</P>
<P>
The Spruce Goose -- a label Hughes despised, because the plane
actually was made mostly of birch -- was 218 feet long and 79 feet
high. With Hughes at the controls, the aircraft made its first and
only flight over Los Angeles Harbor in late 1947. The plane later was
kept on display in Long Beach, Calif., then was moved to Oregon last
year.

 French President Defends His Actions on Bosnia Camps (Bonn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BONN, Germany
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
French President Francois Mitterrand, defending his
apparent failure to investigate concentration camps in Bosnia after a
top-level appeal, says that France did more and acted faster than any
other country.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Newsday, presidential spokesman Jean Musitelli
Wednesday implicitly acknowledged the charge against Mitterrand of
``silence and inaction'' for at least five weeks in the summer of
1992. But he added more fuel to a politically volatile issue by
turning the charge around and suggesting that it also applied to the
Bosnian leaders who made it.
</P>
<P>
Newsday reported earlier this month that Mitterrand failed to order
an investigation or any other follow-up.
</P>
<P>
A two-page statement by the French presidency last Friday in
response to the Newsday account did not dispute the essential points.
Indeed, the Elysee Palace acknowledged that France undertook no action
until early August 1992, when Mitterrand demanded that every camp be
``visited, monitored and opened.'' In mid-August, it noted, Mitterrand
sent Humanitarian Affairs Minister Bernard Kouchner to inspect camps
in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
``Who did better and who acted quicker?'' the Elysee statement
said. In fact, no government, including the United States, took action
to uncover and halt the atrocities for weeks until a groundswell of
public opinion led to a series of resolutions at the U.N. Security
Council. Most of these resolutions have not been implemented, however.
</P>
<P>
``Concerning the Americans, to be charitable, let us not speak of
them,'' Musitelli said. France's European partners were reluctant to
act, and there was no will at the United Nations, he said. Mitterrand
went to Sarajevo to ``bear witness with his solidarity, to shake the
world's consciousness and to permit President (Alija) Izetbegovic to
speak before the world media.''
</P>
<P>
The controversy emerged after the screening of ``Bosna!''
(Bosnia!), a documentary film directed by French philospher
Bernard-Henri Levy that is fiercely critical of official French policy
favoring partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
Izetbegovic related in the film that in June 1992, taking advantage
of the French leader's sudden dramatic trip to Sarajevo, he had
personally briefed his visitor about massacres of civilians and
deportations to camps. The Bosnian leader appealed to Mitterrand in
public to send monitors to determine the truth of the allegations.
</P>
<P>
During the five weeks between Mitterrand's Sarajevo visit on June
28, 1992, and Newsday's publication Aug. 2 of an account of systematic
atrocities, thousands of civilians were massacred in camps, according
to a new U.N. study.
</P>
<P>
Levy has demanded a change of policy and threatened to organize an
independent slate of candidates for the European parliamentary
elections next month. Such a slate, favoring direct aid to the Bosnian
government, would split Mitterrand's socialists and cut into the
conservative government's list as well. Mitterrand, forced to defend
an unpopular policy, criticized the news media, other Western
countries and, as well as the Bosnian government. In the film,
Izetbegovic expressed ``great surprise'' that, after briefing
Mitterrand on the camps, the French president ``remained silent'' upon
returning to Paris. Mitterrand's spokesman, in a letter to Newsday
Wednesday, accused the Bosnian government of doing the same thing.
</P>
<P>
``How do you explain that the Bosnian leaders, who now reproach
Francois Mitterrand for his silence and inaction'' in the summer of
1992, ``remained, it seems to me, silent and inactive themselves
during this period?'' Musitelli said. Musitelli did not indicate any
disagreement with his own characterization of Mitterrand's response as
``silence and inaction.''
</P>
<P>
He repeated a suggestion carried five days earlier in the Elysee
statement that the news media also failed to pursue the same tips
Mitterrand had received on the existence of concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
``To say that the president of the republic would have been the
only one to obtain that exclusive information stated by Mr.
Izetbegovic is an absurdity,'' the Elysee statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said Izetbegovic mentioned concentration camps during the joint
news appearance with Mitterrand June 28 after their private meeting.
</P>
<P>
``If that information was new, how can one explain that it did not
arouse more interest from the media which were there?''
</P>
<P>
(In fact, international news media had little access to most
Serb-controlled territory until July 13, 1992, when Newsday became the
first foreign publication to reach Banja Luka, the main city in the
Serb-conquered areas of Bosnia. Newsday published its first account
about purported Serbian death camps July 19, 1992, and two weeks
later, after locating witnesses, reported on systematic killing in the
camps.)
</P>
<P>
The Elysee statement alleged that the Bosnian government did not
even circulate a list of concentration camps until Aug. 5. In fact,
according to a U.N. investigation, the Bosnian government handed a
list of more than 100 camps to U.N. military officials in Sarajevo
July 26 and it was transmitted immediately to the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
That was only the latest of many lists that had been issued in the
form of government bulletins and broadcast on Sarajevo radio since
late May 1992.
</P>
<P>
Asked to explain the discrepancy in the dates, Muriel de
Pierrebourg, Mitterrand's press attache, told Newsday: ``We have
published the communique. For us the matter is finished.'' She
declined to say whether France had been aware of the official Bosnian
statements.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Musitelli said in his letter to Newsday that the essence of the
matter lies ``not in precise dates or details.'' The essence was ``the
absurdity of the thesis which consists of making Francois Mitterrand
responsible, through his silence, for the delay in the discovery of
the camps.''
</P>
<P>
Newsday asked the Elysee in early May to determine whether
Mitterrand, on his return from Sarajevo in 1992, had ordered the
French government to investigate Izetbegovic's allegations or had
informed fellow Western leaders. De Pierrebourg said she had no answer
to this question.
</P>
<P>
``We have told the truth, everything we know, everything we are
able to reconstruct,'' she said.

 Clinton Woos Congress on Health Care (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid an embattled chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee, lawmakers who can't get together and an American public
still not banging down legislators' doors for action, President
Clinton visited Capitol Hill Wednesday to inject some political muscle
into the health care debate.
</P>
<P>
``I was urging the position that I strongly feel we must pass
health care this year,'' Clinton said after the first of three
meetings. ``I think we must find a way to cover all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
Clinton put on a full-court press Wednesday, bringing key staffers
and Cabinet members to the hill. While he told reporters he received a
``very heartening progress report'' from Democratic leaders, senators
at a bipartisan session later said he got a frank and candid
assessment of the obstacles facing reform.
</P>
<P>
``It's obvious there remains substantial diagreements over how to
best proceed,'' Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said after
the session. But he said it also was ``obvious there's a growing
desire to get something done.''
</P>
<P>
Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., who has been working closely with Sen.
Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y., chairman of the Finance Committee, to get a
bipartisan accord, said after the meeting: ``I said Mr. President, I
support mandates. I will support mandates. But if this bill had
mandates it will lose.''
</P>
<P>
While Democratic leaders and the White House downplayed the
meetings as just pre-recess updates, administration officials are
privately concerned that Congress will recess for Memorial Day without
meeting the goal of at least one major committee completing its work
on a health care bill.
</P>
<P>
The House Ways and Means Committee -- whose chairman, Rep. Daniel
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., is embroiled in legal troubles that threaten his
very tenure in the House -- is still haggling with the Congressional
Budget Office over the costs of the various health plan scenarios. The
House Energy and Commerce Committee is deadlocked and the Senate
Finance Committee, while apparently approaching agreement, has still
not begun to debate any specific bill. And while the Senate Labor and
Human Resources Committee is well under way in considering a
Clinton-like plan proposed by its chairman, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., that committee won't complete its work until sometime in
June.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, health care advocates are worried that whatever
emerges from this process will be a watered-down version of the
original Clinton proposal. And they realize that they still have some
work to do to get the average American energized over this issue.
</P>
<P>
``My own feeling is that the American people have to speak up
more,'' said John Rother, chief lobbyist for the American Association
of Retired Persons and head of a broad-based coalition in favor of
reform. The trouble, Rother said, is that ``people don't know what's
going to happen if we don't have reform.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., chairman of the Ways and Means health
subcommittee, agreed. ``The fact is, 150 million people have a health
care plan,'' Stark said at a health reporters' breakfast this week.
``The worry of health care for the majority of Americans is an
economic worry and as the economy gets a little better, they may feel
a little better about their health care.''
</P>
<P>
Clinton had originally planned to meet only with Democrats -- first
with Senate Democratic leaders and then the full House Democratic
caucus. But Mitchell prevailed on the president Wednesday to add a
session that included Senate Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether she could support alternatives that would reform many
aspects of the insurance industry, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
said: ``It is absolutely clear to me that we need to make a lot of the
reforms that are being mentioned. But in the absence of a definite
plan that will achieve universal coverage, those are not enough.''

 Study Finds Car Theives Like Cabrios, but Not Cavalier Wagons 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Want to buy a sexy car that offers loads of``fahrvergnugen?''
Consider a VW Cabrio.
</P>
<P>
Want to buy one that's more pedestrian but more likely to be there
intact when you emerge from the mall? Buy a sensible, practical,
Chevrolet Cavalier station wagon. Apparently, that Chevy model is
about as popular among thieves as a cop with a flashlight.
</P>
<P>
The Highway Loss Data Institute, an insurance industry trade group,
said in its annual auto theft report that the VW convertible had the
highest rate of theft claims, based on payments by insurance companies
between 1991 and 1993 for 1991 through 1993 models.
</P>
<P>
The claims include those for thefts of entire cars and for parts,
such as radios, air bags and hood ornaments. In VW's case, said Kim
Hazelbaker, senior vice president of the insurance group, the high
claim rate is due mostly to the theft of radios, a longstanding
problem in VWs that apparently, said Hazelbaker, is made worse by the
limited security of a convertible.
</P>
<P>
Hazelbaker hastened to point out that the report's conclusions do
not apply to the redesigned, 1995 VW Cabrio introduced earlier this
month. VW spokesman Andy Boyd in Auburn Hills, Mich., says neither the
radio nor its mounting system was changed, but that a factory
anti-theft alarm now is standard.
</P>
<P>
The Cavalier wagon had the lowest theft claim frequency. Why the
wagon and not the mechanically similar coupe, sedan or convertible
models? Probably, says Hazelbaker, because the wagon is more likely to
be put to bed at night in a safe suburban garage.
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reason, the Cavalier wagon's days are numbered. It
will be discontinued at the end of the current model year. A
redesigned Cavalier line due in the fall will not include a wagon.
</P>
<P>
Whatever you drive, though, there was some good news from the
insurance folks: The frequency of claims overall for '93 models was
the lowest in history -- about one-fourth that for 1979 models in their
first year, said Hazelbaker. ``Clearly,'' he said, ``anti-theft
devices have had some impact and so has increased public awareness of
the problem, particularly because of carjackings.''
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the group said, the average claim is now four times
as high as it was in 1979, because cars, parts and repairs are more
expensive now.

 Clinton Proposes Cap on Children for Welfare Recipients (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ending months of intense debate within the
administration, President Clinton will propose making it easier for
states to deny additional benefits to women who have children while
already on welfare, senior administration officials say.
</P>
<P>
The decision aligns Clinton with those inside and outside the
administration who argue that government must intensify its efforts to
discourage out-of-wedlock births, which now constitute roughly 30
percent of all births in America. ``We think it is very important to
discourage additional births on welfare,'' said one senior official.
``We are saying that states that want to try this approach should be
able to try it.''
</P>
<P>
But the so-called ``family cap'' policy inspires even more intense
opposition among liberals than the proposed two-year time limit on
welfare that is at the center of Clinton's plan, which is now expected
to be introduced shortly after he returns from commemorating the 50th
anniversary of D-Day in Europe next month.
</P>
<P>
Given its potential to affect the most intimate decisions of
millions of women, the family cap issue is certain to provoke a
polarized struggle in Congress. Many moderate and conservative
legislators see the family cap as a way to promote personal
responsibility, while liberals largely denounce it as racist and
sexist social engineering. No other proposal may more starkly
demonstrate the difficulty of finding common ground between left and
right on the emotional issues swirling through welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
``This is clearly one where there are very deep feelings on both
sides of the issue, and apart from the families it directly affects,
it has a large symbolic impact,'' said Mark Greenberg, an attorney
with the Center for Law and Social Policy in Washington.
</P>
<P>
In fact, although Clinton settled on the new policy at a Tuesday
meeting, administration officials still appear divided over how
closely to identify with the controversial idea. Some officials take
pains to say the administration does not intend to push states to
adopt family cap policies, merely to smooth the way for those
interested in the idea. One agency official lukewarm to the policy
insisted the decision left the administration ``neutral'' on the
question of whether more states should adopt the caps.
</P>
<P>
But other senior officials acknowledge that by streamlining the
approval process and signaling at least tacit federal support for the
family cap, the administration plan will inevitably encourage more
states to embrace the idea. Outside observers agree.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
``The notion of states trying different approaches and learning
what we can from those different approaches makes enormous common
sense and political sense,'' said Delaware Gov. Thomas R. Carper, a
Democrat, who presented the administration proposals to a closed
session of the National Governors' Association executive board
Wednesday. ``That flexibility on the part of the administration is
likely to draw support from many of us in the NGA.''
</P>
<P>
It is a sign of how far the welfare reform debate has shifted over
the past year that the family cap that Clinton will propose -- while
anathema to liberal advocacy groups -- occupies a middle ground among
the competing efforts to discourage out-of-wedlock births.
</P>
<P>
As a presidential candidate, Clinton declared that he would allow
states to experiment with the family cap proposal -- although he
declined to sign such a law when he was governor of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
The administration plan reflects that perspective. It would not
require states to impose a family cap, but it would allow them to
implement such policies without federal approval, sources said. Under
current law, states cannot implement such policies without waivers
from the Health and Human Services department, a process that can take
months and require extensive negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Only three states have received federal approval for a family cap
plan. The Bush administration approved a proposal from New Jersey, and
the Clinton administration has approved plans in Georgia and Arkansas.
Applications are pending from California, Maryland and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
In Congress, which must approve Clinton's proposal, a fierce
ideological cross fire over the family cap idea has already erupted.
</P>
<P>
Many moderate and conservative legislators are pushing for sterner
measures to discourage out-of-wedlock births. The principal House
Republican reform bill would require states to deny additional
benefits to women who have children while they are on the rolls,
unless the state passes a law specifically providing such benefits. A
group of House Democratic moderates led by Rep. Dave McCurdy, D-Okla.,
has introduced identical legislation.
</P>
<P>
``The administration proposal is still short of what I think is
required, but they could have done worse,'' McCurdy said. ``We have
to, as a nation, start to remove the incentive for out-of-wedlock,
illegitimate, births.''
</P>
<P>
A competing Republican welfare reform proposal -- introduced by
conservative legislators in both houses and backed by leading
conservative activists, including Jack F. Kemp and William J. Bennett
 -- would require family caps without allowing states to exempt
themselves. In the name of further reducing illegitimate births, both
Republican bills would also cut off all welfare payments to unmarried
young mothers.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the family cap is pointedly absent in liberal
welfare reform plans introduced last week by Rep. Robert T. Matsui,
D-Calif., and Wednesday, with 42 co-sponsors, by Rep. Patsy T. Mink
(D-Hawaii). Internal administration opponents of the plan still hold
out the hope that Clinton will trade away the family cap as a means of
broadening liberal support for the overall initiative.
</P>
<P>
Liberal legislators and welfare advocacy groups regard the family
cap as a mean-spirited effort that punishes the children of recipients
in an effort to change their parents' behavior.
</P>
<P>
Advocates also contend that family caps pander to the stereotype
that welfare recipients bear more children to sweeten their welfare
checks. In fact, they say, welfare mothers typically receive only $57
more a month for a new child, while 72 percent of welfare families
have two children or less, according to federal statistics.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Early results in New Jersey, the only state that has actually
implemented a family cap, show that births have declined among welfare
mothers since the policy went into place. But it remains uncertain
whether those numbers reflect the cap's impact, a general decline in
child-bearing in the state, or a decreased willingness among welfare
recipients to report new births.
</P>
<P>
The American Civil Liberties Union and the National Organization
for Women are challenging the New Jersey plan in federal court,
arguing that the policy violates the privacy rights of welfare
recipients.
</P>
<P>
Despite those objections, family cap supporters, which have
included Democratic and minority legislators as well as conservatives,
consider it an essential component of efforts to discourage long-term
welfare dependency. ``It's hard enough to escape welfare with one
child, and each additional child makes it that much more difficult to
stay in training or hold down work,'' said the senior administration
official.
</P>
<P>
Still, the official said, the administration did not consider the
evidence from New Jersey decisive enough to require states to adopt
the family cap. ``The early results from New Jersey show some promise
but it's too early to tell for sure what they mean,'' said the
official. ``That's the reason for not mandating it nationwide.''

 Brokerages Rig Trading to Gain Higher Profits, Study Says (New York)

<DATELINE>
NEW YORK

<TEXT>
<P>
A new study strongly suggests that the United States'
brokerage firms collude with one another to rig over-the-counter
trading and ensure themselves artificially high trading profits at the
expense of investors.
</P>
<P>
The study by two business professors examined price data for the
stocks of 100 large companies traded on the NASDAQ market for
over-the-counter stocks, and is believed to be the first to examine
such price data in great detail. It came up with the seemingly bizarre
finding that for 71 of these stocks -- including such giant companies
as Apple Computer and Lotus Development -- prices were almost never
posted on NASDAQ in ``odd eighths'' such as 22 1/8, 22 3/8, 22 5/8 and 22 7/8.

As a result, the spread between ``bid'' and ``asked'' prices -- in
effect, the profit the brokerage firm makes on each share traded -- was
almost never less than a quarter of a point, or 25 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
The study, most of which was immediately condemned by NASDAQ, comes
as criticism of the fairness of over-the-counter trading has escalated
in recent months. It also comes at a time of fierce rivalry between
the highly computerized NASDAQ system and exchanges such as the New
York Stock Exchange and American Stock Exchange. NASDAQ has used
fairness and efficiency as a key point of its marketing.
</P>
<P>
The authors of the study -- Vanderbilt University business professor
William Christie and Ohio State University business professor Paul
Schultz -- made copies of their study available Wednesday. Christie
said it was accepted for publication in the next issue of Journal of
Finance, due out in about six months. The journal is the official
publication of the American Finance Association, an organization of
professors who specialize in economics, business and finance.
</P>
<P>
The study initially examined data for the full year 1991, and then
went back and confirmed the same results for 1994 to date, according
to Christie.
</P>
<P>
Richard G. Ketchum, chief operating officer of the National
Association of Securities Dealers, which operates NASDAQ, in an
interview did not dispute that the 71 stocks almost never trade at
spreads narrower than 25 cents. But he said there were legitimate
reasons. He said the study ``is irresponsible and in fact we believe
it is slanderous.''
</P>
<P>
The authors emphasized that they have no conclusive proof of
collusion, which would violate securities laws. But after analyzing
and rejecting other possible explanations, they stated ``we are unable
to offer any other plausible explanation for the lack of odd-eighth
quotes.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
They noted that in rare instances when the stocks were quoted at
such prices, the prices typically were posted for less than two
minutes before being removed. The authors noted that there were
several ways dealers could punish maverick rivals who tried to narrow
the spread, including the diversion of trades.
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Christie said he believes the Securities and
Exchange Commission should launch an investigation of OTC trading.
Brandon Becker, the SEC's head of market regulation, could not
immediately be reached for comment late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Wall Street firms that are large ``market makers'' in OTC stocks
Wednesday did not seem eager to comment on the charge of price
collusion. A spokesman for Merrill Lynch, the nation's largest
brokerage firm, said the firm had no comment. Prudential Securities
and Smith Barney Shearson also did not respond to repeated calls
seeking comment.

 Tobacco Firm Lawyers Steered Grants to Scientists to Defend Position 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cigarette company lawyers for years ran a ``special projects''
division within the putatively independent Council for Tobacco
Research, steering grants to favored scientists whose research might
be used to defend the industry from legal attack, internal documents
show.
</P>
<P>
Documents from the files of Brown Williamson Tobacco Co. show
that top lawyers from the major cigarette companies during the 1970s
and '80s made ``special project'' grants to scores of scientists and
research organizations, bypassing a scientific advisory board of
outside experts.
</P>
<P>
``The industry research effort has included special projects
designed to find scientists and medical doctors who might serve as
industry witnesses in lawsuits or in a legislative forum,'' said B W
general counsel Ernest Pepples in a 1978 memo to then company chairman
Joseph E. Eden.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco industry officials long have asserted the council's
independence from business and legal concerns, saying its grants are
based on scientific merit alone. The claim has been central to the
defense of smoker-death cases, in which industry lawyers have cited
lavish support for the council as proof of an honest quest for
knowledge about the effects of tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
Neither Pepples nor officials of the Council for Tobacco Research,
based in New York, could be reached for comment. However, Tom
Fitzgerald, a spokesman for Brown Williamson, said: ``We believe the
Council for Tobacco Research operates with integrity and funds
meritorious research by independent scientists who are then encouraged
to publish it.''
</P>
<P>
Council materials are among reams of B W documents recently
provided to congressional tobacco foes Reps. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and
Henry Waxman, D-Calif., and to several news organizations, including
the Los Angeles Times. B W -- the No. 3 U.S. cigarette company, which
markets Barclay, Kool and other brands -- says the documents were
stolen by a former paralegal for a law firm that represents the
company.
</P>
<P>
The council will be the focus of a hearing Thursday before Waxman's
House subcommittee on health and environment.
</P>
<P>
Originally called the Tobacco Industry Research Council, the CTR
was the industry's response to early studies linking smoking and lung
cancer -- a linkage so unspeakable for tobacco executives that B W's
parent, British-American Tobacco, for a time used the code word
``ZEPHYR'' to describe the disease.
</P>
<P>
The council was launched in 1954 with ads in 448 U.S. newspapers.
Under the heading, ``A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers,'' the
tobacco companies proclaimed: ``We accept an interest in people's
health as a basic responsibility, paramount to every other
consideration in our business.''
</P>
<P>
According to the announcement, the research council would get at
the truth of the health allegations by investigating ``all phases of
tobacco use and health.'' An advisory panel of experts ``disinterested
in the cigarette industry'' would screen research proposals for
scientific merit. In the years since, the body has provided more than
$223 million in research grants, according to the council's 1993
annual report.
</P>
<P>
The new disclosures are not the first to raise questions about the
council. Tobacco foes in the past have denounced it as a public
relations ploy meant to promote the fiction of a continuing debate on
the health effects of smoking.
</P>
<P>
In a candid 1974 memo introduced in a trial over the death several
years ago of a New Jersey smoker, the research director of Lorillard
Inc. acknowledged: ``Historically, the joint industry-funded smoking
and health research programs hve been selected ... for various
purposes, such as public relations, political relations, position for
litigation, etc.''
</P>
<P>
But the newly leaked papers provide the most detailed information
yet on the council's role in industry legal strategy.
</P>
<P>
The documents include dozens of letters from attorneys with two big
industry law firms -- Shook, Hardy Bacon in Kansas City, Mo.; and
Jacob, Medinger Finnegan in New York -- seeking approval of CTR
``special project'' grants for various researchers. The letters were
sent to Pepples and top lawyers for the other big cigarette companies.
</P>
<P>
At least some of the ``special project'' grants went to researchers
studying alternative explanations for high rates of heart disease and
lung cancer among smokers.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Shook, Hardy and Jacob, Medinger declined to discuss
details of the special project grants, although Shook, Hardy attorney
Gary Long said the research was not secret and grantees were allowed
to publish their findings.
</P>
<P>
The documents show that at least one researcher rejected for
regular funding from the council turned to the lawyers instead.
</P>
<P>
According to the papers, after Louisiana State University
researcher Dr. Henry Rothschild was turned down in 1981, industry
lawyers granted CTR special project funding for his research on
genetic and environmental factors in lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
Rothschild later testified for the industry before Congress,
according to the documents, which include a 1978 journal article,
co-authored by Rothschild, that criticized as dubious such advice from
doctors as ``the complete elimination of cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
``I don't think there were any restrictions placed on what we
found,'' Rothschild said in a telephone interview Wednesday when asked
about his special project funding. ``There was no quid pro quo.''
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
A perennial recipient of special project funds was Carl C. Seltzer,
formerly of the Harvard University School of Public Health. The
documents include four newspaper clippings and four television news
transcripts chronicling a trip to Australia in May 1979, in which
Seltzer's view that smoking does not cause heart disease was widely
quoted.
</P>
<P>
``Reports from colleagues in Australia and New Zealand indicate
that Dr. Seltzer's visit `was a great success,' '' said a Shook, Hardy
lawyer in a letter to Pepples.
</P>
<P>
``The CTR supported all kinds of research,'' including research
``contrary to the interests of the tobacco companies,'' Seltzer, now
semi-retired, said in a telephone interview Wednesday. ``I think
that's a very important thing.''
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Tobacco foes said the disclosures debunk industry claims about the
council.
</P>
<P>
``It's an amazing situation, because to have a group of lawyers
basically selecting scientific research ... completely goes against
the normal process by which scientific investigations are conducted,''
said Stanton Glantz, a University of California, San Francisco medical
professor and longtime industry critic. The documents, he said,
``really reveal that the CTR as it was presented to the public was
just a sham.''

 Hubble Telescope Spots Huge New `Black Hole' in Outer Space (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Astronomers peering through the Hubble Space Telescope
at the core of a giant galaxy 50 million light years from Earth say
they have found the first conclusive evidence for the existence of a
super-massive ``black hole'' -- an object with gravity so huge it traps
everything that comes near, even light.
</P>
<P>
National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials Wednesday
called the discovery Hubble's ``most significant so far,'' and among
NASA's most important ever.
</P>
<P>
As big as 2 billion to 3 billion suns packed into a region as wide
as our solar system, the huge black hole lurks at the core of the M87
galaxy, one of 1,000 galaxies clustered in the constellation Virgo.
</P>
<P>
``If it isn't a black hole, then I don't know what it is,'' said
Johns Hopkins University astronomer Holland Ford, a co-investigator on
the project.
</P>
<P>
Ford has pursued the discovery since 1979. When conclusive data
arrived May 5 at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore,
he said, ``we were all walking about a foot off the ground. ... It's
finally a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
First theorized 30 years ago, black holes are believed to form from
the collapsed atomic rubble of stars, dust and gas. Since no light or
other signals escapes from their gravitational grip, they disclose
nothing directly of their nature. And until Hubble was repaired in
December, no telescope has been able to see deep enough into any
galaxy to disclose what might lie near its core.
</P>
<P>
The presence of the black hole in M87 was finally indicated by the
speed of hot gas swirling in toward the galaxy's center, accelerating
like suds into a bathtub drain. Hubble's instruments clocked the gas
60 light years from the center at 1 million mph -- fast enough to cross
the United States in seven seconds.
</P>
<P>
(A light year is the distance light travels in one year, or about
5.9 trillion miles. Sixty light years is about four times the distance
from the Earth to the nearest star, Alpha Centauri.)
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Nothing but the gravitational attraction of something at M87's core
with a mass of 2 billion to 3 billion suns could prevent matter at
that speed from flying off in all directions. The only candidate
within the confines of today's physics that meets that description,
the scientists said, is a super-massive black hole.
</P>
<P>
``This is a tremendous breakthrough,'' said Dr. Daniel Weedman,
NASA's director of astrophysics. A longtime black hole skeptic, he is
now a convert. ``I do believe there is a supermassive black hole at
the center of (M87),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Weedman called the black hole discovery Hubble's ``most significant
so far, (and) very close to the top of (NASA's) most significant
discoveries.''
</P>
<P>
Proof of the existence of black holes at the cores of galaxies was
one of the primary goals established for the Hubble telescope at its
launch in April 1990. But its mirror flaw delayed the observations
until this year.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Last February, barely 30 days after the Hubble telescope resumed
gathering scientific data, it took its first picture of the core of
M87. To astronomers' astonishment, it disclosed a surprisingly
well-ordered, spiraling ``pancake'' of hot gas -- just what they needed
to measure its speed.
</P>
<P>
On May 5, they got their first speed measurements from Hubble's
Faint Object Spectrograph. Gas on one side of the spiral was rushing
toward Earth at 1 million mph; gas on the other side was rushing away
at the same speed.
</P>
<P>
``We nailed it. We knew we had it,'' said Richard J. Harms, the
spectrograph's principal investigator.
</P>
<P>
Hubble scientists will now continue their pursuit. They will peer
deeper into M87 for more data on the black hole there, and into other
galaxies to see whether they, too, have black holes at their centers.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Astrophysicists don't know how super-massive black holes are
created, or whether they are a cause or effect of giant galaxies like
M87. They may form from the merger of smaller black holes.
</P>
<P>
Although the oldest stars in M87 are nearly as old as the universe
itself -- 12 to 15 billion years -- Harms said the age of M87's black
hole is unknown. Its internal structure, if it has any, can never be
known because no light or anything else can ever emerge to reveal it.
</P>
<P>
One structure they can see is a giant, braided jet of hot gas that
is spewing from near the center of M87 at right angles to the spiral
of infalling gas. The fast-moving jet
</P>
<P>
is believed to be debris from the destruction of stars entering the
black hole.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
The black hole's ultimate fate is unknown. It could eventually
consume the entire M87 galaxy, and even other galaxies that blunder
within range.
</P>
<P>
``Earth is in no immediate danger,'' quipped University of
Washington astronomer Bruce Margon, who helped designed the Faint
Object Spectrograph.
</P>
<P>
While M87's black hole ``has an infinite appetite,'' said Harms,
``it can't hunt.''

 U.N. Chief Denounces Response to Rwanda (United Nations) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
UNITED NATIONS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali
Wednesday called the international response to Rwanda's ethnic
bloodletting a ``failure'' and a ``scandal'' for which the United
Nations and leading countries in the West and Africa share
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
``It is genocide which has been committed. More than 200,000 people
have been killed, and the world is still discussing what ought to be
done,'' Boutros-Ghali said. ``It is a scandal. I am the first one to
say it, and I am ready to repeat it.''
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali vented his frustration at a news conference after
pleading for weeks to Western and African governments for soldiers and
equipment to provide a 5,500-troop peacekeeping force for the central
African nation that since April 6 has been reduced to bloody chaos by
a civil war and by tribal conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan crisis, and the unwillingness in world capitals to
dispatch troops to help resolve it, have highlighted a broad retreat
from activism through the United Nations -- extending well beyond the
United States -- after ambitious, costly and criticized U.N. operations
in Somalia and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
In that vein, Boutros-Ghali's comments illustrated the difference
between his view of the United Nations as a political first-aid agency
that must rush to help ailing nations, and the Clinton
administration's new concept that a long list of safety conditions
must be in place before the United Nations should intervene.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has received commitments from just three
countries -- Ghana, Ethiopia and Senegal -- for a total of 2,100 troops
for a Rwanda peacekeeping force. The Security Council voted May 16 to
set up the force, but the United States cast some doubt on the mission
by insisting that the council review the decision before the bulk of
the troops are deployed.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali attributed the lax response to ``fatigue'' among U.N.
member states, which are already supporting 17 peacekeeping
operations. Many major donor countries are facing economic
difficulties, he said, and ``public opinion is not helping the
different governments.''
</P>
<P>
The U.N. secretary general turned to the Organization of African
Unity for help, but the regional bloc was unable to mobilize a
collective response. Many African governments are plagued by economic
hardships and political strife.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali said he also hopes to receive troop commitments from
Egypt, Zimbabwe and Nigeria. But U.N. officials said these troops do
not have the minimum weapons and equipment they need, and it remains
unclear how they will travel to and within Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali said he met in South Africa earlier this month with
six heads of state attending President Nelson Mandela's inauguration.
``I begged them to send troops. . . . Unfortunately-let me say with
great humility-I failed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
After talks in South Africa with Vice President Gore, Boutros-Ghali
reached a compromise with the United States over the peacekeepers'
purpose. They will be deployed in Kigali, the Rwandan capital, as
Boutros-Ghali had insisted, and in border areas outside Rwanda to
protect and feed refugees, as the United States proposed.
</P>
<P>
``The mandate is limited,'' Boutros-Ghali said, adding that the
peacekeepers, when they get to Rwanda, will try to ``contain the
deterioration'' and serve and reinforce the position of U.N.
negotiators trying to secure a cease-fire. The secretary general
pleaded for the world not to be put off by the lack of success in some
U.N. missions. The United Nations, he said, ``is like going to the
hospital. You can't say, I don't want to take this case. There is a
moral responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration, in policy guidelines published early
this month, insisted that a cease-fire must be in place and that
troops and resources must already have been pledged for a peacekeeping
mission before the United States would support it. At a special
session in Geneva Wednesday, the U.N. Commission on Human Rights
appointed a law professor from Ivory Coast, Rene Degni Segui, to
investigate the ``root causes and responsibilities for the
atrocities'' in Rwanda and ordered him to report his findings to
Boutros-Ghali within a month.

 Jubilant Navy Grads Ready to Move Beyond Scandal (Annapolis) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ANNAPOLIS, Md.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As both hands gripped his gleaming U.S. Naval
Academy diploma Wednesday, Christopher Paul Slattery leaped off the
stadium stage with a yelp of glee and high-fives for fellow graduates.
</P>
<P>
For Slattery and 867 other academy graduates at the U.S. Navy
Marine Corps Memorial Stadium, it was a day of both joy and relief -- 
joy at surviving the school's brutal academic and physical regimen and
relief at the prospect of putting behind them 17 months of scandal and
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
``This is what we've all looked forward to for about 1,200 days,''
said Slattery, a computer science major from Essex Junction, Vt. ``As
a class, we've put it behind us. It's been dealt with thoroughly, and
the think the whole school learned a lot from it.''
</P>
<P>
Since the middle of their junior year, Slattery and his classmates
have felt the glare of international media attention in the wake of
the worst cheating scandal in the school's 149-year history. When it
ended, 88 classmates had been found guilty of participating in the
theft, distribution and sale of an electrical engineering exam in
December 1992. Twenty-four midshipmen were expelled, and 64 received
lesser punishments-including late graduation.
</P>
<P>
Little mention was made of the Class of 1994's tribulations at the
commencement, held on a sticky-hot day that forced many of the 23,500
people in the stadium to use programs and paper hats to shield
themselves from the sun.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of his speech, President Clinton forgave graduates
who had broken academy rules, but he stressed that his forgiveness
encompassed only minor offenses and did not include cheating. Later,
he briefly mentioned the cheating incident and urged graduates to move
beyond it. ``You have my confidence,'' he said. ``You have America's
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
A smiling Clinton later shook the hand of every graduate as the men
and women filed onto the stage for nearly an hour to receive their
diplomas. Beyond the cheating scandal, this graduating class has been
rocked by tragedy. Last December, an academy graduate fatally shot his
former fiancee and her boyfriend -- who both also attended the academy
 -- before killing himself at the U.S. Naval Amphibious Base in
Coronado, Calif. Less than a week later, three midshipmen died when a
car in which they were passengers slammed into a fallen tree near
Annapolis.
</P>
<P>
The weight of those six deaths and the spectre of the scandal
couldn't be fully shaken by graduates, many of whom had friends who
were either expelled or faced late graduations and other punishments
for their roles in the incident.
</P>
<P>
Slattery said he was a friend of Max Lane, a football player who
was expelled for his part in the scandal. Lane, an offensive lineman,
was selected in the National Football League draft last April.
</P>
<P>
``As much as it hurts not to have some friends here, the honor code
is really important to what this academy is all about,'' Slattery
said.
</P>
<P>
Karen Heine, of Crofton, Md., said she has gotten used to frequent
questions from friends and acquaintances about the scandal. Yet Heine,
who has dreamed since childhood of graduating from the academy, said
the cloud over her class would not taint her memories.
</P>
<P>
Heine, a systems engineering major who is the highest ranking woman
in her class, said she too knows people who were involved in the
incident, but feels ``detached. I don't feel angry at them. Everyone
makes mistakes, and people pay the consequences of their mistakes.''

 Official: U.S. Troops Were Near Iraqi Chemical Weapons Depot (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite prior claims by Pentagon officials that there
were no Iraqi chemical weapons near the Persian Gulf war battlefields,
a senior U.S. military-intelligence official testified before Congress
Wednesday that U.S. troops conducted operations near an Iraqi
chemical-weapons storage site.
</P>
<P>
During a Senate Banking Committee hearing on the causes of health
problems suffered by veterans of the war, Undersecretary of Defense
Edwin Dorn echoed past statements by other senior Pentagon officials,
including Deputy Defense Secretary John Deutch, and said that ``no
chemical or biological weapons were found in the Kuwait theater of
operations ... among the tons of live and spent munitions recovered
following the war.''
</P>
<P>
But in subsequent testimony Wednesday, Dr. John Kriese, chief
officer for ground forces at the Defense Intelligence Agency, said
Dorn's statement should have been removed from his prepared statement
because a stockpile of Iraqi chemical weapons was indeed discovered
near an area where U.S. troops were located.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Kriese said the Iraqi chemical-weapons depot was near
the Kuwaiti border, across a desert river, within 17 miles of U.S.
positions.
</P>
<P>
The revelation came as the committee's chairman, Sen. Donald Riegle
Jr., D-Mich., released a 160-page report concluding that compelling
anecdotal evidence exists showing that U.S. and allied troops were
exposed to harmful levels of chemical -- and possibly biological -- 
contaminants during the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that several years before the war, the U.S.
government shipped materials to Iraq that its leader, Saddam Hussein,
used to develop chemical weapons. Chemical weapons appear to have been
used on allied troops, many of whom subsequently developed multiple
health problems collectively known as Persian Gulf War syndrome,
Riegle said.
</P>
<P>
Riegle Wednesday called for the Pentagon to fully disclose all it
knows about the use of chemical and biological weapons during the war.
He estimated that ``tens of thousands'' of the nearly 700,000 gulf war
vets are suffering symptoms of the syndrome, including thousands of
personnel still on active duty. What's more, there's a ``strong
possibility'' that the syndrome has been transferred by the vets to
their spouses and children, Riegle said, adding that some of the
veterans appear to be sick because of the aftereffects of nerve-gas
vaccines administered by the military.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
People who say they are afflicted with the syndrome have
experienced a variety of ills including muscle spasms, joint pain,
gastrointenstinal problems, chronic flu-like symptoms, respiratory
difficulties, gynecological infections, bleeding gums, rashes and
vomiting.
</P>
<P>
Dorn, Kriese and Dr. Theodore Prociv, assistant secretary of
defense for chemical/biological matters, testified that they have not
ruled out the possibility that U.S. troops were harmed by chemical or
biological weapons in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Dorn also released a joint letter signed by Secretary of Defense
William Perry and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman John Shalikashvili
and dated Wednesday promising that all those affected would receive
medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Still, the officials said they have found no concrete evidence
suporting Riegle's contention that the Iraqis probably used chemical
or biological weapons in the war or that plumes of contaminated smoke
and fallout from chemical production facilities bombed by the allies
wafted over U.S. positions, poisoning U.S. troops. Dorn also said the
Pentagon knows of only about 2,000 people ``for whom a clear diagnosis
continues to elude physicians.''

 Border Governor's Conference Members Vie for NAFTA Project Funds 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the North American Free Trade Agreement now in effect, the
annual meeting of U.S. and Mexican border state governors will begin
in Phoenix Thursday with a strong undercurrent of competition, unlike
the neighborly atmosphere of past gatherings.
</P>
<P>
The Border Governor's Conference begins as member states on both
sides of the Rio Grande River are competing for billions of dollars in
funds to finance a host of proposed NAFTA-related transportation and
environmental projects. Those projects -- to be funded by the U.S.
government and the World Bank -- translate into jobs and economic
benefits that politicians everywhere lust after.
</P>
<P>
Although the governors of California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas
and their six Mexican counterparts are accentuating their fraternity,
their staff members admit the leaders intend to size up the
competition for projects that range from a sewage treatment plant in
San Diego, telecommunications links in Nogales, Ariz., and interstate
highway funds in Laredo, Texas.
</P>
<P>
``The battle will be who gets the money and who has the best
proposals,'' said Rudy Fernandez, director of California-Mexico
affairs in the state's Trade and Commerce Agency.
</P>
<P>
California may already have a competitive disadvantage, at least in
generating cooperation from Mexican governors. That's because Gov.
Pete Wilson's use of illegal immigration as a political issue has
offended many Mexicans as well as Mexican-Americans, observers said.
Wilson is scheduled to attend the conference.
</P>
<P>
To fully maximize NAFTA-related business, the states have to build
the infrastructure -- roads, bridges, sewers, environmental controls,
border checkpoints and communications links -- to make themselves
attractive to business.
</P>
<P>
A big chunk of the federal aid targeted by the states was created
by NAFTA itself. To get the trade bill past environmental interests in
Congress, the U.S and Mexican governments agreed to fund billions of
dollars in environmental projects funneled through a new North
American Development Bank, or NADBank, headquartered in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
Making the decisions on which environmental projects to fund will
be the new Border Environmental Cooperation Commission based in El
Paso, Texas, also created by a side deal to NAFTA, which will be
responsible for evaluating and prioritizing environmental project
proposals.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Although Texas got most of the NAFTA bureaucracy and some jobs when
it snared the headquarters offices of NADBank, BECC and three other
NAFTA-related agencies, the project dollars are still very much up for
grabs.
</P>
<P>
On the Mexican side of the ``frontera,'' the six border states are
positioning themselves for the competition for up to $5 billion in
loans that the World Bank will make available for border
infrastructure and environmental projects over the next several years,
</P>
<P>
Among the major NAFTA-related projects under discussion in Mexico
is a new deep water port in Guaymas, located in the Mexican state of
Sonora about 250 miles south of the Arizona border city of Nogales.
Because the port would stimulate its border traffic, Arizona officials
strongly support the project and are cooperating with Mexican
officials in its planning.

 Clinton Campaigns on Capitol Hill for Health Care Agenda (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Clinton made the rounds of Capitol Hill
Wednesday to promote his health care agenda, offering a spoonful of
conciliatory honey to Republican senators whose support he hopes to
win, and following it with a dash of combative vinegar to stiffen the
resolve of Democratic House members.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, accompanied by a phalanx of top administration officials,
held the series of closed meetings as a sendoff for Congress as it
prepares to adjourn for its Memorial Day recess.
</P>
<P>
For Democrats in particular, the weeklong break could be a time of
intense pressure from constituents and interest groups at home.
Clinton's health care plan is encountering difficulties in all five
congressional committees considering it. Democrats are also nursing
their wounds from a special election in Kentucky, hailed by
Republicans as a referendum on Clinton's policies, that saw one
congressional district fall into GOP hands for the first time in more
than a century.
</P>
<P>
As Clinton left a session with House and Senate Democratic leaders
 -- the first of three held with various groups in Congress -- he said
his health care bill is ``something we very much want to do in a
bipartisan fashion.'' But by the end of the third meeting, which was a
pep rally for the entire Democratic membership of the House, it was
clear that Clinton was in a more confrontational mood.
</P>
<P>
``The president told us something that was important for us to
hear: If we really want to accomplish something, we've got to fight
for it,'' said Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., who is one of Clinton's
chief House allies in the health care battle.
</P>
<P>
Added Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont., another subcommittee chairman
with jurisdiction over health: ``He used the word `fight' a half a
dozen times.''
</P>
<P>
Only one of the closed sessions included any Republican
participants -- and it was Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell's,
D-Maine., idea to invite them. However, Democrats and Republicans
alike said Clinton had been solicitous at the session and eager to
hear the views of both sides.
</P>
<P>
Republicans said they told Clinton bluntly that the linchpin of his
plan -- a requirement that employers pay for their workers' health
coverage -- will not pass.
</P>
<P>
``I told him, `Mr. President, I support mandates. I will support
mandates, but I think if this bill has mandates, it loses,'' said Sen.
Bob Packwood, R-Ore. Packwood is ranking Republican on the Senate
Finance Committee, which is considered difficult territory for
Clinton's plan.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
On a more positive note for the administration, a second House
subcommittee managed to approve a version of the Clinton plan shortly
before the president arrived on Capitol Hill. The House Education and
Labor Committee's labor-management relations subcommittee, chaired by
Williams, voted 17-10 in favor of the plan. It passed strictly along
party lines, without a single GOP vote.
</P>
<P>
The bill contains the basic elements of the Clinton plan, but
substitutes voluntary purchasing cooperatives for mandatory health
alliances.
</P>
<P>
It also contains more generous benefits in such areas as women's
health, mental health and dental care, and increases subsidies to help
small businesses afford their workers' coverage.

 2 Asian Gang Members Arrested in German Tourist Killing (Riverside) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
RIVERSIDE, Calif.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two 19-year-olds were arrested Wednesday in the
slaying of a 62-year-old German tourist and the attempted killing of
her husband last week at a remote mountain overlook.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the two men were associates of an Asian street
gang, but that gang activity was not believed to be a factor in the
attack on the German couple. The victims were shot at a scenic
viewpoint alongside California 243, in the San Jacinto Mountains.
</P>
<P>
A third suspect remains at large, Sheriff's Department spokesman
Deputy Mark Lohman said.
</P>
<P>
The arrests came nine days after the Germans were attacked during
an apparent robbery, which left Gisela Pfleger dead from gunshot
wounds to her head. Her husband, Klaus Pfleger, 64, was critically
wounded with two gunshots to his face and another in his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Wednesday, Lohman offered no details of the
investigation that led to the arrest of the two teen-agers following
an all-night interrogation. He said the handgun believed to have been
used in the shootings, as well as the suspected getaway car, were
seized by detectives who searched four homes in the Banning, Calif.,
area Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Three other teen-agers who were taken in for questioning Tuesday
afternoon were released Wednesday. All five had been rounded up
without resistence.
</P>
<P>
Lohman identified the shooting suspects as Xou Yang and Khamchan
``Brett'' Ketsouvannasane. Both were born in Laos and are legal U.S.
residents, he said. They were held at a Riverside County detention
center on $250,000 bail, and were expected to be arraigned on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Riverside County Deputy District Attorney Richard Bentley said his
office would decide Thursday whether to prosecute the suspects as
defendants in a capital case, because of the special legal
circumstances involving alleged murder committed in the commission of
a robbery.

 Policy Tied to Math and Morality (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In seeking to implement quickly a new program for
processing Haitian boat people and answer its critics, the Clinton
administration is relying on a set of calculations that involve a
peculiar mix of mathematics and morality.
</P>
<P>
Current plans call for facilities that can handle as many as 5,000
Haitians at a time, according to a defense policy official. But
administration officials say that an operation on that scale can only
succeed if they can rapidly decide who is eligible for refugee status
and then quickly return the rest to Haiti.
</P>
<P>
If they do not send back those who fail to qualify, administration
officials insist, there will be a mass exodus.
</P>
<P>
A nightmare scenario underlies both the administration's planning
process and its argument against more lenient treatment of refugees.
It goes something like this: Encouraged by hope that they might get a
permanent home outside Haiti, thousands of Haitians set out to sea,
overwhelming the facilities set up to accommodate them. Many are
forced to stay afloat in rickety boats while awaiting a place -- and
eventually a shipwreck kills hundreds.
</P>
<P>
Officials insist that this gruesome vision lies at the heart of a
policy-making process in which every statement and gesture must be
weighed in terms of how many Haitians it might prompt into a reckless
sea voyage. Given the large number of people who want to leave the
island, officials worry that false hopes could prompt a disaster.
</P>
<P>
Explaining why the administration has rejected proposals to create
a refuge for all Haitian boat people, State Department spokesman Mike
McCurry said Wednesday, ``It has been our concern that the creation of
a so-called safe haven might encourage people to use very unsafe means
of migration to try to arrive at a safe haven.''
</P>
<P>
The administration's critics, who have an interest in minimizing
the number of potential refugees and the dangers they face, contend
that the White House is using the nightmare scenario as an excuse to
avoid taking necessary steps.
</P>
<P>
``They have talked themselves into fearing a mass exodus, and now
they are trying to talk everybody else into it as way of justifying
inaction,'' said Jocelyn McCalla, executive director of the National
Coalition of Haitian Refugees.
</P>
<P>
The number of Haitians who might set out in boats if they had a
realistic hope of escaping their homeland is a matter of speculation
and debate.
</P>
<P>
The administration is operating on an assessment that as many as
1,500 to 2,000 people a day could go to sea, and eventually the
numbers could reach between 50,000 and 100,000 if none were to be sent
back, a source said.
</P>
<P>
Shep Lowman, director of refugee affairs for the U.S. Catholic
Conference, argues that such numbers are exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Lowman said, the numbers would be somewhere between the
1,300 people who have left in the past two weeks and the 5,000 a month
that was the peak flow in the aftermath of the 1991 military takeover.
</P>
<P>
Other advocates like McCalla put the number even lower, saying that
less than 20,000 people would show up if the United States created a
safe haven.
</P>
<P>
In the face of protests from these critics, President Clinton
abruptly announced on May 8 that the U.S. would halt its policy of
automatically returning all boat people intercepted by the Coast Guard
to Haiti and instead would create some kind of processing facility
where the Haitians could apply for refugee status. Those rejected -- 
and Clinton warned they would be the overwhelming majority -- would
still be sent back.
</P>
<P>
In the two and a half weeks since then, the government has been
busy on many fronts, lobbying foreign governments to allow a
processing facility on their territory, chartering ships and hiring
personnel. But no concrete plans have been announced.
</P>
<P>
The delay is unavoidable, administration officials argue, because
the delicate calculations of refugee flows demand that a complete
processing and resettlement plan be in place the day the program
opens.
</P>
<P>
``In humanitarian terms it would be morally irresponsible to create
a large magnet by effecting this change in policy before it can be
fully implemented,'' said a senior administration official. ``Lives
are at stake.''
</P>
<P>
This view finds some support from immigration experts. ``There is
going to be a very substantial bubble in the number of people up
front, and that is where you cannot afford to make any mistakes,''
said Demetrios Papademetriou, director of the immigration policy
program at the Carnegie Endowment.
</P>
<P>
Unless the administration offers some form of safe haven, the only
way to avoid being overwhelmed, he said, is ``by showing from the
start that people who are simply fleeing poverty will not end up in
Miami, and you cannot do that unless you have set up a processing
facility that is big enough and then some. So you have to be able to
guess right on the numbers you'll face.''
</P>
<P>
But some advocates argue that the decision of whether to risk life
and limb for a chance to reach the United States is one that only the
refugees themselves can make.
</P>
<P>
``The idea that it would be morally incorrect to allow Haitians the
opportunity to seek asylum because it would put them in danger is very
paternalistic,'' Lowman said. ``That kind of thinking would paralyze
refugee operations all over the world. I'm sorry, that is a decision
you have to leave to the refugee. They are aware of the dangers of the
sea.''

 Clinton Implores Democrats to Battle for His Health Bill (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Clinton delivered an attack on congressional
Republicans Wednesday and told a closed-door meeting of House
Democrats they must ``fight back'' against efforts to sabotage the
health bill and other key administration legislation if they are to
survive the November election.
</P>
<P>
With growing bipartisan concerns over whether any comprehensive
health care bill is possible this year, Clinton held a pro forma
outreach session with the leading Senate players on health care issues
from both parties, but he blasted the Republicans in a caucus with his
fellow Democrats moments later.
</P>
<P>
Before the camera lights and microphones, leaders of both parties
pronounced the three Capitol Hill sessions ``productive'' and
``constructive.'' But House Democrats, who met separately with Clinton
in a Democrats-only caucus, quoted him as saying Republicans hope to
reap election gains by blocking his legislative program.
</P>
<P>
``Their strategy is not to cooperate on anything,'' one note-taking
House member quoted Clinton as saying. Urging the Democrats to finish
action this year on the crime bill, health care and the worldwide
trade agreement, Clinton reportedly said history suggested Republicans
would make gains in November and warned that the new GOP members
``will be right-wing fanatics, not moderates,'' according to a
listener's notes. ``The only way you win is to fight back,`` he said.
</P>
<P>
Members and staff said there were no new positions taken on health
care legislation, which was the ostensible subject of the Capitol Hill
visit. They said no compromises were reached, and there were no hints
of how the administration might deal with the central issue that could
cause the yearlong effortto fail: how to pay for universal coverage.
</P>
<P>
``I'm concerned that in these meetings we always sort of say the
same things,'' said Sen. John Breaux, D-La., one of the only Democrats
in a meeting to voice opposition to the requirement that employers pay
part of their workers' coverage. This is the main financing method in
most bills under consideration.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Democratic leaders and committee chairmen and
then in a bipartisan session that included Minority Leader Robert J.
Dole, R-Kan., and the sponsors of the major Republican bills, Clinton
heard the kind of committee-by-committee status reports and positions
that dozens of White House aides are paid to give him at a moment's
notice.
</P>
<P>
Democrats told him, according to participants, that three House
committees and two Senate committees are working to craft bills that
can win approval, but even the leader of the pack, the Senate Labor
and Human Resources Committee, has been forced to delay completion
until after the Memorial Day recess, the last unofficial deadline for
committee action.
</P>
<P>
``I don't want to minimize the difference between members of both
parties and between the members of each party,'' said Senate Majority
Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine.
</P>
<P>
At the last minute, the White House scheduled the session with the
Senate Republica ns. The White House had earlier said the president
would meet with Republicans on health care after the recess, but after
objections were raised by the congressional relations and
communications staffs, the meeting was hastily squeezed in Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
``It got added for the reason that we didn't want to give the
Republicans ammunition'' to argue the administration is not operating
on its promised bipartisan basis, one official said.

 Clinton to Renew China's Trade Status With Few Sanctions (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Clinton is expected to announce Thursday
that he will renew China's trade privileges, but he may impose
extremely limited sanctions on Chinese-made guns and ammunition,
according to sources who were briefed on the White House decision.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Wednesday that the Clinton administration also
plans to set up a new commission to examine human rights abuses in
China. The commission reportedly would be headed by former President
Jimmy Carter, who established diplomatic relations with the Beijing
regime in 1979 while he was in the White House.
</P>
<P>
The new commission would be designed as a replacement for the
approach that Clinton proposed last year but will now abandon: using
trade as leverage to improve human rights in China. In recent days,
human rights groups have denounced the idea of a human rights
commission for China as a meaningless exercise.
</P>
<P>
``It would have no authority, no clout and no teeth,'' said Mike
Jendrzejczyk, Washington director of Human Rights Watch (Asia).
</P>
<P>
The administration is facing a deadline of June 3 to decide whether
to renew China's most-favored-nation trade benefits, which permit
Chinese goods to be sold in this country under the same low tariffs
enjoyed by virtually all other countries. Last year, Clinton suggested
that China should make ``overall significant progress'' on human
rights if it wanted renewal of these benefits for next year.
</P>
<P>
The president's decision to renew the trade benefits would stand
unless both houses of Congress pass a resolution to revoke it.
</P>
<P>
As Clinton prepared to announce his decision on future policy
toward China, the White House struggled throughout Wednesday to win
the critical support of Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell,
D-Maine, the principal architect of the policy of linking trade
benefits to human rights.
</P>
<P>
In the last few days, the main question was not whether Clinton
would renew China's overall trade benefits, since all sides have
agreed for weeks that he would do so. Rather, the issue was whether he
would impose sanctions on Chinese imports in response to human rights
abuses.
</P>
<P>
Administration officials hope to avoid the embarrassment of a split
with Mitchell, who has been urging the White House to impose some
significant sanctions on Chinese products.
</P>
<P>
The White House was considering limited economic sanctions on
Chinese weapons, or no penalties at all. But Mitchell was pressing for
broader, more significant penalties on all Chinese products made by
the People's Liberation Army or by defense-related companies.
</P>
<P>
Not only is Mitchell the Senate majority leader, but he also has
done more than anyone to create the China issue that was used for
years by congressional Democrats against former President Bush. In the
years after China's bloody 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy
demonstrations, he pressed for legislation attaching conditions to the
renewal of China's trade benefits.
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Clinton embraced Mitchell's approach during the 1992
campaign, when he accused Bush of ``coddling dictators'' in Beijing
and criticized Bush for vetoing legislation on the issue that Mitchell
had sponsored.
</P>
<P>
Now, after a year in the White House, Clinton is backing away from
Mitchell's policy. Administration officials said he plans to drop, for
the future, the presidential executive order he issued last year
attaching a series of human rights conditions to the renewal of
China's trade status.
</P>
<P>
By imposing penalties exclusively on Chinese-made guns and
ammunition, the Clinton administration would, in effect, convert the
China trade issue into a gun-control measure. Mitchell has objected,
saying the penalties on Chinese-made guns and ammunition do not go far
enough. China exports more than $31 billion in products to the United
States and the guns and ammunition make up only a tiny share of these
sales.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
``Mitchell`s trying to (penalize) all products of
defense-industrial companies (in China). And the administration is
trying to say, `arms only,' '' one congressional source said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The administration has been under intense pressure from the
American business community to renew China's trade benefits. U.S.
companies fear that, if the benefits are revoked, China will retaliate
against American companies and simply deal instead with their European
and Asian competitors.
</P>
<P>
The executive order that Clinton issued last year put the
administration in an awkward position. Officials believed at the time
that the human rights conditions they imposed were so reasonable and
limited that China would be able and willing to meet them.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1993 order, China was required to open the way for
emigration of the families of some dissidents and to take action to
curb the export of goods made with prison labor. In addition, China
was supposed to make ``overall significant progress'' on releasing
dissidents from prison, on stopping the jamming of Voice of America
broadcasts and on preserving Tibet's cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
China has repeatedly denounced imposition of these conditions and
has said that it will never be pressured into changing its domestic
policies. Over the last few months, while releasing a handful of
well-known political prisoners, Chinese authorities also have rounded
up a number of other dissidents.
</P>
<P>
In April, for example, China once again arrested Wei Jingsheng,
China's best-known proponent of democracy, who had been released last
September after serving more than 14 years in jail. Wei is still being
detained.

 New York Task Force Rejects Legalization of Assisted Suicide 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a report likely to influence the national debate on the issue, a
New York state task force unanimously has rejected the idea of
legalizing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the report, released Wednesday by the New York State Task
Force on Life and the Law, urges that medical professionals do better
at treating pain and depression -- two prime factors behind patient
requests for assisted suicide. Though some of the task force's 23
members believe that assisted suicide can be ethical in rare cases,
they agreed that legalizing it carries a large risk of abuse,
especially ``to those who are poor, elderly, members of a minority
group or without access to good medical care.''
</P>
<P>
In some cases, the report said, ``patients may be pressured to
consent to euthanasia when their care is expensive or burdensome to
others. As one commentator has argued, `Advocating legal sanction of
euthanasia at a time and in a society where access to care is so
limited and its cost so critical, the so-called ``right to die'' all
too easily becomes a duty to die.' ''
</P>
<P>
The report -- more than 200 pages long and two years in the making -- 
follows two events that offered hope to supporters of assisted
suicide. On May 2, a Michigan jury acquitted Dr. Jack Kevorkian of
charges that he helped a terminally ill man kill himself, in violation
of a Michigan law aimed at Kevorkian. The next day, a federal judge in
Seattle struck down the state's ban on the practice, finding a right
to assisted suicide implicit in the constitutional guarantee of
liberty. The New York report finds no such right in the state or
federal Constitution.
</P>
<P>
``Even though momentum has been building, the task force is sending
a clear warning signal that society should slow down and take a hard
look at who would be at risk,'' said Tracy Miller, the task force's
executive director.
</P>
<P>
As the Seattle and Michigan cases move toward the Supreme Court,
the report is likely to be influential. ``This is the first public
body that has put out a thoughtful, deliberative report,'' said Arthur
Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of
Pennsylvania, who agrees with the report's findings. ``It'll be a
report that gets cited and invoked.''
</P>
<P>
In rejecting legalization, the task force felt strongly that
assisted suicide and euthanasia would be hard to control. The task
force fears that assisted suicide, in which patients kill themselves
with devices or drugs provided by doctors, would escalate to
euthanasia, in which doctors do the killing themselves, with or
without an explicit request from the patient.
</P>
<P>
``Once you accept the validity of killing by physicians, there's no
way to put brakes on the practice,'' said a prominent opponent of the
practices, Richard Doerflinger, associate director of the Secretariat
for Pro-Life Activities at the National Conference of Catholic
Bishops.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
One precedent the report cited was the Netherlands, which stopped
short of legalizing euthanasia but guarantees physicians immunity if
they follow strict guidelines. There, one government report showed
2,300 cases a year of euthanasia at the patient's request and 1,000
cases a year without a current request from the patient. Projecting
that onto the United States, the task force estimated a possible
36,000 deaths a year from voluntary euthanasia and 16,000 from
non-voluntary.
</P>
<P>
Though the task force does represent a variety of views on the
underlying ethics of the issue, William Batt, president of the Hemlock
Society of New York, which supports assisted suicide, said that it is
out of touch on the issue and cited polls showing increasing public
support for assisted suicide.
</P>
<P>
For the task force, the bottom line was risk of abuse. One member,
Barbara Shack, a director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said:
``In the end, the thing that I think brought everybody together was
that for a very tiny percentage of people who may have untreatable
pain and suffering, where people might agree that it might be
ethically and morally acceptable to assist in a death, the possible
negative impact of such a change in the law was too dangerous.''

 Wal-Mart Dumps `Always the Low Price' Slogan 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When competitors and an advertising industry review group
challenged Wal-Mart to justify its slogan, ``Always the low price,
always,'' the nation's largest retailer blinked.
</P>
<P>
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has agreed to change the slogan, the National
Advertising Review Board said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Bentonville, Ark., retailer acted after the review board, made
up of 70 advertising professionals and public interest members,
recommended that the slogan be changed to eliminate references to
``the low price.'' The board recommended that any modified slogan
refrain from stating or implying that Wal-Mart's prices are ``always
the lowest.''
</P>
<P>
The panel has no power to enforce its recommendations, but if
advertisers refuse to make changes the panel can refer the case to the
Federal Trade Commission. One such case is now pending before the FTC.
</P>
<P>
``They are unable always to have the low price,'' said Ron Graham,
a Minnesota business executive and chairman of an ad hoc group of the
advertising review board. ``It's very difficult in this mass
merchandise environment for any competitor to know that all of their
prices are lower.''
</P>
<P>
Wal-Mart officials were not immediately available for comment. The
company said in a statement filed with the review board that it
disagreed with the panel's decision, but would voluntarily modify its
advertising slogan over the next several months.
</P>
<P>
``We encourage our competitors to examine their own advertising
claims and slogans with the same care and to act accordingly,''
Wal-Mart said in its statement.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the New York-based review board, which was established
in 1971 so that advertisers could police themselves and keep
government intervention to a minimum, said the Wal-Mart case is
significant for the advertising and retailing industries.
</P>
<P>
``This wasn't just a casual campaign. This was their corporate
identifier,'' said Steve Cole, the review board's general counsel.
``Maybe this will have a ripple effect. Retail advertising now is full
of problems. There are an awful lot of claims out there that are
exaggerated. Consumers are not believing retail advertising, which is
a disaster for the advertising industry. Maybe this will be persuasive
to others to look at their claims.''
</P>
<P>
The complaints about Wal-Mart's slogan were brought by three retail
chains, Target Stores Inc., Meijer Inc. and Vision World Inc., and the
National Advertising Review Network, the board's ad hoc group chaired
by Graham.
</P>
<P>
``All we want to do is make it a fair playing field,'' said Carolyn
Brookter, a spokeswoman for Target Stores, a division of
Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson. ``We think this (review board
decision) should do that.''

 A Political Death Watch in Corridors of the Capitol (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A haggard, sad-faced Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., put
himself through his official paces Wednesday, as uneasy House members
awaited word of whether the House Ways and Means chairman would be
indicted or negotiate a felony guilty plea that would end his long
political career and possibly lead to a prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
Widespread news media reports that Rostenkowski's lawyers and the
Justice Department were nearing the end of their discussions prompted
a political death watch of sorts on Capitol Hill, with House members,
staff and press monitoring Rostenkowski's every move.
</P>
<P>
Many members and aides wondered aloud how Rostenkowski has managed
to keep up appearances and continue to push the president's health
care proposals while under intense scrutiny with his career in doubt.
</P>
<P>
``What alternative do I have?'' Rostenkowski responded Wednesday
when a reporter posed the question. ``I just don't have any
alternatives. You just have to do what you have to do.''
</P>
<P>
The cloud of the three-year criminal investigation of alleged
abuses of the House Post Office and of official funds has been hanging
over the 66-year-old Democrat for so long that it is difficult for
many of his allies on the committee to comprehend that Rostenkowski
could be out as chairman as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
``It's kind of eerie,'' said Rep. Sander M. Levin, D-Mich., a
committee member and Rostenkowski ally. Rep. Mike Kopetski, D-Ore.,
another committee member, said, ``I want to keep thinking things will
work out and he'll continue being chairman.''
</P>
<P>
Even House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., who has warned of
congressional inquiries if there is any indication that Rostenkowski
is receiving special treatment from the Justice Department, expressed
sympathy. ``I'm extraordinarily saddened about Rostenkowski,''
Gingrich said. ``Because he was a big man who did a big job. You hate
to see any human being go through this kind of agony.''
</P>
<P>
But committee members and the House Democratic leadership are
bracing for the worst, and Rep. Sam Gibbons (Fla.), 74, the
committee's ranking Democrat, said he's ready for the job.
</P>
<P>
Democratic caucus rules and precedents would have Gibbons step in
as acting chairman if Rostenkowski were indicted, but that is subject
to review by the caucus. If he were to resign from Congress, the
caucus would choose a new chairman.
</P>
<P>
Two senior Democratic committee members, Reps. Charles B. Rangel
(N.Y.) and Fortney ``Pete'' Stark (Calif.), Wednesday endorsed Gibbons
for the post if Rostenkowski is forced to step aside.
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski, who has led the Ways and Means Committee since Ronald
Reagan took office in 1981, was crucial to passage of President
Clinton's major economic package last year and has been central to
Clinton's efforts to pass a comprehensive health care plan this year.
However, Gibbons and other committee members Wednesday disputed that
health care reform efforts would collapse in Rostenkowski's absence.
</P>
<P>
Even First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton told reporters that while
the loss of the chairman ``would be an obstacle Congress would have to
figure out how to overcome . . . health care reform and the need for
it is bigger than any one person in this country.''
</P>
<P>
``Somebody told me about a crack somebody made on television last
night that the graveyard is full of indispensable men,'' the jovial
Gibbons told a reporter. ``I think all of us realize we're mortal and
that when we go, somebody steps forward. That's just life.''
</P>
<P>
``Thirty-two years in this job,'' said Gibbons. ``I'm ready.''
</P>
<P>
Rep. Harold E. Ford, D-Tenn., a senior committee member, suggested
that Rostenkowski voluntarily step aside as chairman immediately
because the media attention to his legal troubles has distracted
members from deliberations on health care legislation.
</P>
<P>
``We're losing focus, really, on the issue that's before the
committee,'' Ford said. ``Everybody around here is focused on
Rostenkowski, and that is not to be down on Danny.''
</P>
<P>
Ford speaks from experience. He stepped aside from a Ways and Means
subcommittee chairmanship for six years while he successfully fought
an indictment. He was the last House member affected by the Democratic
rule that compels indicted chairmen to step aside.
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski's legal travail has become a preoccupation of House
members, many of whom fear it will provide fresh ammunition for
critics of the institution and GOP challengers in the fall election.
</P>
<P>
``The mood is just so nasty out there in the countryside and this
just makes us all the more beleaguered,'' said one politically
vulnerable House Democrat.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday Rostenkowski presided for much of the morning over a
tedious committee hearing on alternative health care reform proposals,
surrounded by reporters and television cameras. Later in the
afternoon, he took part in a House and Senate Democratic leadership
meeting with the president in the Capitol to discuss the prospects of
his health care plan.
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski fended off questions about the status of his case, but
in an interview he sought to defend his record over a colorful career
that spans more than three decades: ``I think I'm a committed
legislator. I think my record as a legislator is worthwhile. I don't
know too many problems that as a legislator I haven't tried to
solve.''

 Prosecutors Said to Offer Final Deal to Rosty (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Attorney Eric H. Holder Jr. has made a final plea
bargain offer in negotiations with lawyers for Rep. Dan Rostenkowski,
D-Ill., and set Tuesday as the deadline for Rostenkowski to accept the
proposal or risk almost certain indictment on a wide range of charges,
sources knowledgeable about the negotiations said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
If Rostenkowski refuses, the sources said, Holder's move for an
indictment against the House Ways and Means Committee chairman would
be swift, possibly as early as the Tuesday deadline.
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski declined to comment Wednesday on the negotiations and
efforts to reach his attorney, Robert S. Bennett, were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
But Democrats on the committee said that Rostenkowski still hoped
to avoid going to jail, and was leaning toward fighting the
prosecution's case that he conspired to defraud the government through
misuse of his congressional office funds.
</P>
<P>
Throughout negotiations, federal prosecutors have insisted that
Rostenkowski plead guilty to at least one felony charge and serve some
time in jail. After haggling for days over the breadth of the charges,
sources said Holder has now made clear that the negotiating ``can't
continue forever.''
</P>
<P>
Holder is ``simply waiting to hear from Rostenkowski,'' said a
source close to the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
This latest twist to the complex and fluid negotiations over
Rostenkowski's legal future indicates that one of Congress's most
influential members is all but certain to leave or be removed from the
Ways and Means chairmanship, a position thought to be critical in the
ongoing debate over President Clinton's plans for health and welfare
reform. Rostenkowski is considered an invaluable ally on both fronts.
</P>
<P>
Under normal procedures of the House Democratic Caucus,
Rostenkowski would have to step down from the committee chairmanship
if he were indicted on a felony punishable by at least two years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, a guilty plea apparently would give him a small window
of opportunity to retain the chairmanship. The rules do not compel a
member convicted of criminal charges to resign from office or
leadership positions, although such members are likely to face an
ethics investigation and disciplinary actions.
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors have outlined a broad case against Rostenkowski
of conspiracy to defraud the government. After a two-year
investigation, prosecutors have forwarded information to the Justice
Department alleging that the veteran lawmaker paid employees for work
not done and that he abused official accounts for leased cars, office
supplies and office space.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the alleged illegal activity involves ``several
hundred thousand dollars.'' Rostenkowski is accused of trading office
postage stamps for cash and assuming ownership of cars previously
leased by the government, the sources said. He has since reimbursed
the House Stationery Store $82,000, according to individuals familiar
with the case.
</P>
<P>
Investigators also have looked into allegations of obstruction of
justice, said sources, noting that Rostenkowski staff members in
Chicago and Washington could face charges.
</P>
<P>
Because of the scale of the charges outlined, prosecutors are under
pressure to exact a Rostenkowski guilty plea to a conspiracy felony
charge and not just a simple felony count, such as theft, sources
said. The plea, in this view, should clearly indicate the breadth of
the pattern of alleged illegal activity, sources said.
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys have argued for narrowing the scope and number of
charges against the House veteran and have sought to avoid a jail
sentence, or to get as little jail time as possible.
</P>
<P>
The gap between the two positions has blocked resolution of the
issue in recent days.
</P>
<P>
Another critical factor that both sides have considered is that
U.S. District Court Judge Norma H. Johnson is scheduled to oversee the
case, the sources said. Johnson has a tough sentencing record. Sources
said that was likely a factor that led Rostenkowski's attorneys to at
least consider a possible plea bargain.

 Report Says Gulf War Soldiers Exposed to Biological Weapons (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pentagon officials have been concealing or ignoring
evidence that tens of thousands of U.S. Persian Gulf War veterans were
exposed to Iraqi chemical and biological weapons during the conflict,
a Senate report released Wednesday contends.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the Senate Banking,
Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, which interviewed more than 600
veterans in preparing its report, demanded that the Pentagon
declassify all information relating to the detection of chemical and
biological agents.
</P>
<P>
Riegle recalled the Pentagon's reluctance to release information on
Agent Orange after the Vietnam War and raised doubts about the
effectiveness of devices used in the field to detect the presence of
chemical agents.
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent to Persian Gulf War veterans Wednesday, Defense
Secretary William J. Perry and Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said ``there is no information, classified
or unclassified, that indicates that chemical or biological weapons
were used in the Persian Gulf.''
</P>
<P>
But veterans' testimony in the Senate report suggests that chemical
and biological contamination was widespread. Operation Desert Storm
soldiers described 10 incidents of Iraqi rocket attacks that released
noxious fumes or set off chemical agent alarms as well as several
encounters with irritating chemicals in the air. Some 12,000 veterans
have reported symptoms ranging from skin irritation to memory loss,
claiming that they are victims of ``Gulf War Syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
In one incident, eyewitnesses recounted their experiences during
the early hours of Jan. 19, 1991, when an explosion near the port of
Jubayl in Saudi Arabia sent U.S. troops in a naval construction
battalion scurrying for cover. When soldiers emerged from their bomb
shelter, some reported a numbness or a burning sensation on their
skin. One soldier who tested the area for chemical agents that evening
reported that two of three tests had positive readings.
</P>
<P>
At a hearing of Riegle's committee Wednesday, Pentagon officials
said that Iraq did not deploy chemical or biological toxins, even
though hundreds of chemical alarms were triggered during the war. In
some cases, the sensors may have malfunctioned, the officials said,
and in others the alarms were discounted after further review.
</P>
<P>
Defense Undersecretary Edwin Dorn said there is some concern,
however, about the possibility that soldiers could have been exposed
to low levels of chemical warfare agents or fallout in Kuwait and
southern Iraq as a result of Allied bombing of Iraqi military
installations.
</P>
<P>
Riegle accused the Pentagon of concealing or suppressing reports of
toxic exposures during the conflict, saying that the military
establishment has an ``institutional difficulty in coming to terms
with grievous decision errors. ... I've seen our government lie to us
before in other war situations.''
</P>
<P>
Army chemical data included in the Senate report indicates that
U.S. chemical detectors may not have been sensitive enough to register
very low levels of certain agents, such as the nerve gas Sarin, which
can still be harmful if soldiers are exposed to it over long periods.
Last July, Czechoslovakia's minister of defense announced that a
chemical decontamination unit from his country had detected low levels
of Sarin in Saudi Arabia early in the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Symptoms commonly associated with Sarin include respiratory
problems and chest pain, which many veterans reported.
</P>
<P>
Dorn acknowledged that physicians have been unable to diagnose
symptoms of at least 2,000 veterans, many of whom claim to have Gulf
War Syndrome.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
One of those who has suffered since the war is Dean V. Lundholm Jr.
of Live Oak, Calif., who served with an Army National Guard unit.
Since returning from Saudi Arabia in 1991, Lundholm has been so beset
by respiratory and digestive problems that he has been unable to work.
</P>
<P>
``I served my country willingly and proudly,'' said Lundholm, who
founded the California Association of Persian Gulf Veterans, at a
National Institutes of Health hearing last month. ``But I now expect
my country to treat me and other war vets with respect and concern.
And that means we vets should get information, diagnosis and treatment
about our health status.'' Copies of Lundholm's testimony were
distributed at Wednesday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Pentagon also has considered the possibility that
experimental vaccines administered to soldiers to combat chemical
weapon attacks may have led to some veterans' symptoms.
</P>
<P>
A panel of experts led by Nobel Laureate Joshua Lederberg is
re-examining evidence of chemical weapon exposure for the Defense
Department and is expected to report its findings next month, Dorn
said.

 House Confronts Possibility of Rostenkowski's Departure (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An uncommon code of silence enveloped the House
Wednesday as it confronted the strong possibility that Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., will step down as chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee as part of a plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
The powerful lawmaker, an unparalleled master of arm-twisting and
deal-cutting, is considered crucial to the fate of health care reform
as well as the Democrats' overall legislative record.
</P>
<P>
And in corridors and cloakrooms on the House side of Capitol Hill,
members of Congress wondered and worried about who would succeed him -- 
and the implications the succession would have both for them and
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Yet congressional decorum prevented the members from talking openly
about the looming crisis.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, with Rostenkowski seemingly on the verge of indictment for
financial abuse of his office, House Majority Leader Richard A.
Gephardt, D-Mo., called an extraordinary news conference to declare he
has no interest in assuming the leadership of the committee to help
secure the enactment of health care reform.
</P>
<P>
``I think in a way it's an insult to the chairman and the members
of the committee that I or someone else from the leadership would have
to go to the committee so the committee could finish its work on
health care,'' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., too, was unwilling to talk
openly about the ramifications of the Rostenkowski matter. ``I'm not
going to presume the resignation of Mr. Rostenkowski. That's something
I have no knowledge about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was less reticent, however, to
discuss the effect Rostenkowski's departure would have on the
administration's health care proposal.
</P>
<P>
``I certainly hope that doesn't come to pass, but it would be an
obstacle that Congress would have to figure out how to overcome,'' she
said at an International Women's Media Foundation conference here.
</P>
<P>
``It would be a great loss to Congress, but health care reform and
the need for it is bigger than any one person in this country,'' Mrs.
Clinton later told reporters.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rep. Robert T. Matsui, D-Calif., a senior member of the
panel and a Rostenkowski loyalist, remained uncharacteristically
close-lipped about his own intentions.
</P>
<P>
Some members of Congress and their aides have speculated that, if
Matsui challenges ranking committee Democrat Sam Gibbons of Florida
for the chairmanship, Rep. Charles B. Rangel, D-N.Y., and Rep. Fortney
H. ``Pete'' Stark, D-Calif. -- both of whom are senior to Matsui -- also
would seek the job.
</P>
<P>
The nervousness over the chairmanship reflects widespread concern
that Gibbons lacks Rostenkowski's deal-making skills. He also is more
a specialist in trade than health care.
</P>
<P>
If Rostenkowski leaves, the Democratic Steering and Policy
Committee would recommend a chairman to the Democratic Caucus. If the
ranking member gets the nod, he would be entitled to a separate up or
down vote before any alternative was considered, Foley said.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the negotiations between Rostenkowski's lawyers
and U.S. Attorney Eric H. Holder Jr. indicated that the matter will
not be resolved until next week. Holder reportedly was pressing for a
decision on the plea agreement by Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. attorney's office has been investigating Rostenkowski for
alleged misue of office and campaign accounts, including the
possibility that he improperly received money from the House Post
Office, hired employees who did no work and made improper furniture
and gift purchases from his office funds.
</P>
<P>
A plea agreement would enable him to avoid the humiliation of a
public trial and the prospect of conviction and a lengthy prison
sentence.
</P>
<P>
The chief barrier to an agreement, sources said, has been the
wording of any charge to which Rostenkowski would plead guilty. The
precise description of the charge would be crucial in determining the
punishment that U.S. District Judge Norma H. Johnson could mete out
under the federal sentencing guidelines.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines require judges to explain in writing any departure
they make from the sentences outlined for various crimes. The
sentences are affected by such factors as the amount of money
involved, whether the defendant abused a position of public trust and
whether he has accepted responsibility for his actions.
</P>
<P>
In a fraud conviction involving a loss of more than $200,000, for
example, the guidelines call for a sentence of 15 to 21 months for a
defendant with no prior criminal history. If the loss is between
$70,000 and $120,000, the sentence would range from 10 to 16 months.
</P>
<P>
In a fraud conviction involving an abuse of a position of public or
private trust, the guidelines call for increasing the incarceration.
In a $70,000-plus fraud, for example, the sentence would rise to 15 to
21 months.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines also provide for decreasing the sentence if the
defendant ``clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his
offense.''
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski's lawyer, Robert S. Bennett, has been trying to
persuade prosecutors to agree to a charge under which Johnson, who has
a reputation for tough sentencing, could impose punishment of less
than a year in jail, according to a source familiar with the
negotiations.

 House Somber as Rostenkowski Faces Ouster (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On what many believed could be Rep. Dan Rostenkowski's
last day of presiding as chairman over his beloved House Ways and
Means Committee, the scene was like a death watch for a wounded king.
</P>
<P>
Grim-faced aides moved about the committee room quietly. The likely
successor, Sam M. Gibbons, D-Fla., stayed close to the rostrum as
though he might have to take over any minute. No one wanted to talk
aloud about what was on everyone's mind.
</P>
<P>
Every so often, Rostenkowski, D-Ill., would glance over at the bank
of more than a dozen photographers he knew were there only to capture
his misery as he contemplates a possible indictment on ethics charges
or his resignation from Congress. The color would drain from his
ruddy, expressive face.
</P>
<P>
``It was awful, awful,'' said Rep. Benjamin L. Cardin, D-Md., who
serves on the committee. ``Somebody said it must have been like Jackie
Kennedy's apartment when people came to visit the day before she
died.''
</P>
<P>
Clearly, there was that same sense Wednesday of losing someone
larger than life. This big, gruff, intimidating man, who inspires both
strong loyalty and respect bordering on fear, defines what it means to
be a power in Congress.
</P>
<P>
Of the dozen House and Senate leaders who met with President
Clinton Wednesday to assess the status of his health reform
legislation, Rostenkowski had been expected to be Clinton's most
valuable ally.
</P>
<P>
The congressman's skill at brokering deals -- often using old-time
tactics like threats and rewards, in pursuit of high-sounding public
policy like tax reform -- is unmatched among his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Clinton values Rostenkowski's skills so highly that he took the
politically risky step of campaigning for the Ways and Means Committee
chairman when it appeared Rostenkowski might lose his primary race for
re-election in March.
</P>
<P>
But sometime within a few days, and almost certainly before
Congress returns from its Memorial Day recess, Rostenkowski and his
lawyers are expected to reach a decision that will take him out of the
action.
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski may accept a plea bargain that would force him to give
up his chairmanship, probably leave Congress and possibly serve a
prison sentence. Or he will be indicted and be forced out of his
chairmanship, at least temporarily, by House rules.
</P>
<P>
In any case, Rostenkowski's colleagues have already started
preparing to carry on without him.
</P>
<P>
``Nobody in Congress is indispensable,'' House Speaker Thomas S.
Foley, observed last week.
</P>
<P>
Hillary Rodham Clinton made clear Wednesday that the White House is
adjusting to Rostenkowski's imminent departure from the health reform
process.
</P>
<P>
``It would be an obstacle Congress would have to figure out how to
overcome,'' Mrs. Clinton told reporters. ``It would be a great loss to
Congress, but health care reform and the need for it is bigger than
any one person in this country.''
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski, 66, is among the last of his kind. The product of
Chicago Democratic machine politics, he came to Washington 36 years
ago as the agent of Mayor Richard J. Daley and rose to become the
confidant of presidents.
</P>
<P>
After more than 20 years of aiming for the House speakership,
Rostenkowski got off the leadership ladder in 1981 to take over the
tax-writing Ways and Means Committee. It is probably Congress' most
powerful panel and is a prime target of big-spending lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
The chairman is not a particularly high-living man, but he has
enjoyed the fringe benefits of his job: rich meals and resort
vacations at the expense of lobbyists. He is a regular at Morton's
Steakhouse in Washington, where lobbyists pick up his tab. The Palm
restaurant in Chicago has a special table for him.
</P>
<P>
It may have be Rostenkowski's adherence to the old way of politics
that led him into trouble. The U.S. attorney's office in Washington
conducted an exhaustive probe of his financial dealings for two years
after allegations that surfaced in a probe of the House Post Office.
</P>
<P>
Former House Postmaster Robert Rota pleaded guilty last year to a
scheme in which he funneled tens of thousands of dollars in cash to
members of Congress. He implicated Rostenkowski in the scheme.
</P>
<P>
Although Rostenkowski steadfastly denied any wrongdoing, the
federal inquiry widened to cover virtually all his activities during
his entire service in Congress.
</P>
<P>
According to published reports, federal prosecutors are ready to
seek an indictment that would include charges that Rostenkowski put
ghost employees on his Chicago payroll and used taxpayer money to buy
items for personal and campaign use at the House office supply store.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Rostenkowski reimbursed the government $82,095
for the supply store items. But he insists there was no intentional
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
Among the issues said to be keeping Rostenkowski awake at night is
whether to put longtime aides through what could be a lengthy and
expensive trial to prove his innocence.
</P>
<P>
But friends say they suspect that the U.S. attorney for Washington,
Eric Holder Jr., a Clinton appointee, may not be able to offer
Rostenkowski an attractive enough plea bargain to forestall such a
trial. Any sign of favoritism would look as if Clinton were trying to
cut Rostenkowski a break.

 Hubble Helps Scientists Hone In on Black Hole (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scientists said Wednesday that for the first time they
have found convincing evidence for the existence of a super-massive
black hole in a nearby galaxy, one of astronomy's most sought-after
prey in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Using NASA's recently refurbished Hubble Space Telescope, the
research team was able to photograph a whirlpool of hot gas spinning
around the galactic center where the black hole is believed to lurk.
</P>
<P>
By analyzing the light waves from the gas disk, the researchers
were able to determine how fast it is moving -- about 1.2 million mph -- 
and estimate the size of the object that might be causing it to spin
so furiously. They concluded that at the core of the galaxy there is a
black hole with the mass of at least 2 billion suns compressed to the
size of our solar system.
</P>
<P>
``We were all walking a foot off the ground for three weeks after
we realized what we had found,'' said Holland Ford of the Space
Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
The existence of black holes, probably the weirdest objects in the
universe, confirms a prediction of Einstein's general theory of
relativity. They are dense, extremely compact objects whose
gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light waves,
can escape.
</P>
<P>
The only way to ``see'' a black hole is to infer its presence by
studying how it influences visible matter nearby.
</P>
<P>
Ford had predicted there should be a spinning gas disk at the
center of the galaxy in question -- called M-87 -- and that studying
such a disk might offer clues to the existence of a black hole.
</P>
<P>
As early as 1917, ground-based photos of the galaxy, located about
50 million light years away, had shown evidence of unusual activity at
the core of M-87. Astronomers have since identified a brilliant jet of
electrons spiraling out from the center of the galaxy at nearly the
speed of light.
</P>
<P>
Initial Hubble images -- taken prior to last December's shuttle
mission to correct the telescope's flawed optics -- were not good
enough to show the postulated disk of gas. But photos taken in
February with Hubble's new camera not only revealed the gas disk but
also showed that it was surprisingly well-ordered, according to Ford.
</P>
<P>
That meant that another Hubble instrument could do good
measurements on the light waves being emitted from discrete regions on
the spiral-like disk as it spun.
</P>
<P>
By studying how those light waves are compressed or expanded -- 
depending on whether the disk material is moving toward Earth or away
from it -- astronomers can estimate how fast the disk is spinning.
Combined with an estimate on the radius of the central region of the
galaxy -- taken from the Hubble photos -- astronomers can calculate the
mass of the galactic core.
</P>
<P>
If the calculated mass is sufficiently large compared to the
radius, astronomers argue, the object in question must be a black
hole.
</P>
<P>
The hole at the center of M-87 is estimated to be about as far
across as our solar system -- large, but not out of line with the
expected size of a black hole containing 2 billion or more solar
masses.
</P>
<P>
``If it's not a black hole, it's something stranger,'' astronomer
Bruce Margon of the University of Washington said during a NASA
briefing on the new results.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Weedman, director of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's astrophysics division and a previous skeptic about
the existence of supermassive black holes, said he found the new
evidence convincing. ``Yes, I think this is definitive,'' Weedman
said.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Astronomer Douglas Richstone of the University of Michigan, in a
telephone interview, called the evidence ``pretty convincing'' and
said it is a part of a chain of evidence on the existence of
supermassive black holes that has been building during the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
Astronomers already had come to accept the existence of smaller
black holes associated with the collapse of dying stars several times
larger than our sun.
</P>
<P>
``The evidence for black holes of a few solar masses is very
strong,'' Margon said.
</P>
<P>
But astronomers have been particularly interested in the
possibility of massive black holes at the core of galaxies, since they
could provide the ``engine'' to explain some of the most energetic
events in the universe. Some astronomers have suggested that black
holes may exist at the core of virtually every galaxy, including our
own Milky Way.
</P>
<P>
The Hubble's ability to look more closely at the central regions of
galaxies should help astronomers learn more about the origin of
supermassive black holes, Weedman said. He said theorists still do not
really understand how such objects form and how they behave. He cited
the paradox at M-87, where a black hole presumably is sucking huge
amounts of material toward it while at the same time a jet of
electrons is spiraling outward.

 Neighbors Distressed by Home Alarm's Incessant Shrieking (Baltimore) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BALTIMORE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sound of silence -- that's all residents of a
once-quiet suburban Maryland townhouse court crave. But when they'll
get their wish is still up in the air -- literally.
</P>
<P>
The burglar alarm on a house whose owner is traveling in Indonesia
has been whoop-whoop-whooping around the clock since last Saturday,
and it's driving people nuts.
</P>
<P>
``It's gone off before, but only for 20 minutes or so, then it
stops,'' said Joan Sheppard, one of the neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Sheppard said the man installed the burglar alarm himself, and she
complained that it has annoyed her from time to time for the five
years she has lived there -- but never for such a prolonged period.
</P>
<P>
This time was different. The alarm awakened her at 12:30 a.m.
Saturday. A half-hour later, an accident nearby shut off power to the
area and the alarm stopped briefly.
</P>
<P>
``I said, `Thank God,' but then it came back and it hasn't shut up
since,'' Sheppard said. ``If we go in the back room and close
everything in front, it's not as loud.''
</P>
<P>
The owner left a message on his office answering machine that he
would not return until Memorial Day. However, a friend said the man
was notified of the problem and was air-freighting keys to another
friend to shut off the alarm.
</P>
<P>
Some neighbors along the tree-shaded street have changed their
bedrooms to escape the noise. Others are simply enduring the torment.
</P>
<P>
In any case, residents say the homeowner is in for a lot of grief
when he returns. Some neighbors have detailed their grievances in a
note taped to his storm door.
</P>
<P>
Baltimore County police say they have no authority to break into
the house to silence the alarm, and the electric company says it can't
shut off power to the house because it might damage appliances.

 Smithsonian Names New Secretary (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The regents of the Smithsonian Institution Wednesday
selected Ira Michael Heyman, a lawyer and former chancellor of the
University of California, Berkeley, as its 10th chief executive and
the first non-scientist to lead the museum and research complex.
</P>
<P>
``We considered Mike to be a generalist whose range of skills
matches the Smithsonian's needs and interests,'' said Barber Conable,
the regent who headed the search committee after Heyman stepped down
and put his own name into consideration.
</P>
<P>
Citing a long list of attributes including leadership of a complex
institution, successful fund-raising and deft maneuvering in a highly
charged political environment, Conable said, ``He is an open person,
has no hidden agendas. . . . He has the ability to come back after
hard knocks -- apparently Berkeley is a place where occasionally hard
knocks are administered.''
</P>
<P>
Heyman, who is now counselor to Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt,
stood by Conable at an afternoon press conference and smiled guardedly
at the litany of praise.
</P>
<P>
``I see the Smithsonian as a big, rollicking, dynamic, tough,
interesting, intellectual institution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
But he added that taking the $200,000-a-year position at this
critical transition time brought ``daunting challenges.''
</P>
<P>
``We have a resource problem that is significant, both a public and
private resource problem,'' said Heyman. The Smithsonian is a $458
million-a-year operation, which receives a direct federal
appropriation of $342 million and must make up the rest through
endowments and private donations.
</P>
<P>
Heyman compared the Smithsonian's situation to the one he faced at
Berkeley in 1980 when he became chancellor. ``California was in
economic doldrums,'' he said. ``Things turned around luckily in two
ways. The public fist enlarged slightly. We learned how to raise
money, and we raised an awful lot and it was the saving grace.'' Under
his tenure there was a threefold growth in private donations.
</P>
<P>
The new secretary, who takes over in September, replaces Robert
McC. Adams, an anthropologist who served for the last decade. The
Smithsonian's enterprises include the National Air Space Museum, the
most visited museum in the country, the National Museum of Natural
History, which has 120 million artifacts, and the National Zoo, which
has an estimated 3 million visitors a year.
</P>
<P>
Heyman's election came after a scheduled May 9 vote was postponed
when Vice President Gore, a regent, said he wanted to be present. He
was in South Africa at the time. Though the request was accepted as a
matter of protocol, his move sparked conversation that he disagreed
with the choice of the search committee, particularly that Heyman is a
non-scientist. The other leading contender was Thomas Lovejoy, the
Smithsonian's assistant secretary for environment and external
affairs, who is a friend of Gore's and a prominent tropical biologist.
</P>
<P>
At the regents session, Conable said, there had been ``earnest,
open and civil discussion'' on several topics, including the choice of
a non-scientist. He would say only that Gore had joined that
discussion. Gore would not comment.
</P>
<P>
``The Smithsonian has not abandoned its tradition of scientific
leadership,'' said Conable, praising Heyman's stewardship of the
prestigious scientific undertakings at Berkeley. Heyman said, ``We
will continue to interrelate the research mission and the exhibition
mission.''
</P>
<P>
In its pursuit of new revenue streams, Heyman said, the Smithsonian
has to strike ``the right balance between raising money from the
private sector and not giving away one's soul.''
</P>
<P>
Besides its public funds, its other support comes from an endowment
of the founding benefactor, James Smithson, private donations and
revenues from the Smithsonian magazine, museum shops and other
revenue-generating businesses and contracts. Heyman last year helped
form a panel of citizens who raise funds for the Smithsonian.

 S L Lawsuit Against Arizona Gov. is Settled (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The federal government late Wednesday reached a $12.1
million settlement with Arizona Gov. J. Fife Symington and other
directors of two savings and loans whose failures cost taxpayers more
than $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
Symington, a Republican running for a second term this year, has
for three years been battling the Resolution Trust Corp.'s allegations
that he misused his position as a director of Southwest Savings and
Loan Association in Phoenix. The RTC sued Symington and other
directors in 1991 for $200 million.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released by his office, Symington said he is
``delighted that this issue has finally been resolved.'' He said he
made no personal financial payment nor any admission of wrongdoing as
part of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Katsanos, a spokesman for the RTC, said the entire $12.1
million settlement will come from the estate of the late Daniel K.
Ludwig, owner of Southwest and a second S L, American Savings of Utah.
</P>
<P>
Defendants in RTC civil settlements do not customarily admit or
deny wrongdoing, Katsanos said. The agency determined that Symington
``does not have wealth'' and decided not to pursue him further, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Ludwig, a shipping magnate believed to have been one of the richest
people in the world, personally indemnified the S L directors against
lawsuits. RTC officials said Ludwig apparently gave away much of his
money before he died in August 1992, and his estate was worth less
than the RTC had hoped.
</P>
<P>
Symington also is a target of a criminal investigation into
activities at Southwest, according to sources, who said a federal
grand jury this spring subpoenaed his records.
</P>
<P>
The RTC contended that Symington breached his duties as a director
by failing to disclose the true cost and his actual interest in a
large downtown project Southwest funded. The agency contended that the
upscale hotel-office project ended up costing Southwest more than $38
million.
</P>
<P>
Symington has dubbed the RTC's case against him and the other
Southwest directors a ``witch hunt.'' He said the RTC was simply
looking for someone to blame for the nation's S L mess. There were a
total of 16 directors and other parties involved in Wednesday's
settlement.
</P>
<P>
Symington has said his project and Southwest Savings were both
victims of a crash in the once-booming Arizona real estate market.
</P>
<P>
The RTC said Symington took $8 million in fees from Southwest and a
Japanese bank that helped finance the project. Symington argued that
he put $1.5 million of his own money into the project and personally
guaranteed million in loans from the Japanese bank.

 Sometime Wife of Redskins Owner Gets Out of Drunk-Driving Charge 
 (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A judge Wednesday threw out a drunk-driving charge
against Marlene Ramallo, citing scant evidence that she was
intoxicated when police saw her driving in Georgetown with a gentleman
friend sprawled on the hood of her Jaguar convertible, clinging to the
door frame.
</P>
<P>
``I feel happy,'' said Ramallo, who is 41, or 37, or 39, depending
on which legal documents you look up. She also used to be known as
Marlene Chalmers Cooke and, despite her self-declared name change, is
still more or less the wife of billionaire Jack Kent Cooke, the
81-year-old owner of the Washington Redskins. ``I had a wonderful
judge, a wonderful judge,'' Ramallo said. ``Justice has been done. And
now I hope to go on.''
</P>
<P>
She had been accused of driving under the influence of alcohol,
punishable by up to 30 days in jail and a $300 fine. She displayed
little emotion, barely even a smile, as the charge was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
Unlike Ramallo, most alleged drunk drivers opt to forgo trials,
avoiding heavy legal bills by agreeing to plea bargains, or by
admitting guilt and hoping for leniency. ``She's a very principled
woman,'' said Ramallo's attorney, John Perazich. ``She felt strongly
that she wanted to fight this case, and fortunately she has the
wherewithal to do it.''
</P>
<P>
She emerged from District of Columbia Superior Court after her
trial and found a small swarm of reporters and cameras blocking the
path to her limousine, which was double-parked nearby, her chauffeur
out and waiting.
</P>
<P>
``What do you think of the police?'' a reporter shouted.
</P>
<P>
``Ahh, no comment.''
</P>
<P>
Okay, then what's up with your personal life? How come you're
suddenly using your maiden name, Ramallo? Does it have to do with
Cooke's recent claim that your marriage isn't legally valid, that you
weren't properly divorced from your previous husband?
</P>
<P>
``He's a wonderful man.''
</P>
<P>
(Despite Cooke's pronouncement, the two have been seen together
recently in public.)
</P>
<P>
``What about Patrick? Are you still seeing Patrick?''
</P>
<P>
Patrick Wermer was, as police put it, ``the male subject'' in the
Georgetown incident, a chap in his mid-twenties whom acquaintances
said was a regular nightclub companion of Ramallo's, at least until
Sept. 15, when the two began to argue and Ramallo wound up with the
Jag keys, prompting Wermer to mount the car's hood, claiming the Jag
belonged to him.
</P>
<P>
``He's my friend,'' Ramallo said.
</P>
<P>
Finally someone in her group said, ``Thank you,'' ending the
briefing, and Ramallo was ushered to the limo. She said, ``Ciao!''
</P>
<P>
Perazich said Ramallo had planned to testify in her non-jury trial,
which began Tuesday. But it turned out she didn't have to. Senior
Judge Nicholas Nunzio, granting Perazich's motion, dismissed the
charge minutes after the prosecution had rested its case. The evidence
against Ramallo wasn't strong enough to warrant a defense, the judge
said.
</P>
<P>
Police said that after ordering Ramallo out of the Jaguar, they
noticed her eyes were watery, her breath smelled of alcohol and her
gait was unsteady. At first, she wouldn't submit to a breath test,
Perazich said. Later, after she changed her mind about the test, the
attorney said, police wouldn't allow her to take one, citing her
initial refusal.
</P>
<P>
``Next time somebody's driving a car in Georgetown and has someone
spread-eagle on the hood, I'll be the first person called,'' Perazich
said outside the courthouse, smiling at his victory. ``I'm sure
there'll be numerous calls. I'll probably have to get an unlisted
number.''

 Licensees' Goal Is to Boot Fake World Cup Products (New York) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An underground economy of World Cup merchandise -- 
stretching from leather factories in Pakistan to print shops and
retail stores in New York City -- is cutting into profits of more than
300 companies with rights to sell official products.
</P>
<P>
Three weeks before the games begin, unlicensed T-shirts, bumper
stickers, key rings, soccer balls, shawls, posters, caps and sun
visors are selling rapidly. Industry experts predict these goods, many
bearing the trademarked World Cup mascot -- a cartoon dog named Striker
 -- and protected logos will reap as much as $150 million worldwide.
This includes an estimated take of $45 million in the United States, a
projected 15 percent of official sales, making the event one of the
largest in the history of what is known as ambush marketing.
</P>
<P>
``It's a real octopus-type of problem,'' said Tammy Bloom, legal
counsel at Time Warner Sports Merchandising, the company that licenses
official products for the World Cup and tracks violators. ``On the
street, it is easy to stop one vendor, but there are 25 other
merchants buying the same thing from the same person. It's a very big
global problem.''
</P>
<P>
The quadrennial soccer tournament, which will be held for the first
time in the United States beginning next month, is the biggest
single-sport event in the world. Twenty-four countries will compete at
nine U.S. stadiums. Despite the gray market in unofficial goods, World
Cup organizers estimate that $300 million in official merchandise will
be sold in the United States this year and $1 billion worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Karen Raugust, executive editor of The Licensing Letter, a New York
City-based industry newsletter, said gray-market goods typically bring
in 15 percent of official sales. In the United States, she said, that
should put bootleg World Cup merchandise in the same league as
counterfeit Major League Baseball products.
</P>
<P>
This concerns executives at many of the 302 companies that will
spend as much as $50 million for licenses to sell official World Cup
items around the world. Under terms of their licenses, the companies,
including 95 with rights to market in the United States, can use the
mascot, the World Cup logo -- a red and white flag with a flying blue
soccer ball -- and the words ``World Cup USA '94'' on their products.
</P>
<P>
``It's frustrating,'' said Fred Malamud, director of marketing at
Starline, a New York City company that owns rights to sell action
posters of U.S. players. ``I know, you know and everybody knows there
are knockoffs at little corner stores all over the place, but we don't
have people out there looking for the stuff. That's up to the
licensing people at Time Warner.''

So far, Bloom said, Time Warner has taken legal action against 105
manufacturers, wholesalers or retailers to stop them from selling
counterfeit and other unofficial goods. Bloom said that Time Warner,
which gets most of its tips from licensed companies that hear about
the gray-marketeers from distributors, plans to crack down by joining
private investigators and local and state police and federal marshals
to seize goods as the World Cup nears.
</P>
<P>
Still, a Newsday investigation of the bootleg market operating here
shows that illegal merchandise, some of which is smuggled into the
country from South Korea, Pakistan, Taiwan, China, Mexico and
Colombia, is being sold throughout New York City.
</P>
<P>
Stopping stores from selling rip-off items involves a legal process
that starts with Time Warner sending the merchants a cease-and-desist
order. If they don't comply with the terms of the order, more steps
can be taken, but Bloom said most cases are settled within weeks
before reaching court.
</P>

<P>
There is no accurate way to determine the dollar value of
unofficial goods smuggled into the United States, say industry
experts. In April, U.S. Customs agents in Miami seized a shipment of
sweatshirts and T-shirts featuring the ball-and-flag logo and tags
depicting Striker with ``World Cup USA '94 -- Official Licensed
Product'' printed below. The goods, exported from South Korea and
intended for a distributor in Guayaquil, Ecaudor, are now in a Customs
warehouse and, according to agency policy, will ultimately be
destroyed. Other goods directly turned over to World Cup organizers
will be given to charities after the official product licenses expire
next year.
</P>
<P>
One company outside the reach of the World Cup cops is Golden
Sunshine Inc., a wholesaler based in Anaheim, Calif. Golden Sunshine
sells embroidered patches for $1.25 each that show the name of a
country over a soccer ball and the year 1994. These multicolored
patches, imported from Taiwan and sewn on baseball caps, shirts and
jackets, do not violate any laws. Although the company uses the
official World Cup logo on some of its brochures, that only makes the
brochures unlawful, not the products, Bloom said.
</P>
<P>
``That's real ambush marketing. These patches are selling like
wildfire and appearing all over the world,'' Bloom said. ``We can't do
a thing about it. They followed the rules of the game.''

 Southern England Prepares for Onslaught of D-Day Tourists (Poole) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
POOLE, England
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The strains of Glenn Miller's ``In the Mood'' waft
from an old radio under the canvas tent decked out as a field kitchen,
with tin plates and cups on G.I. tables, and a server dressed in a
blue boiler suit, her hair swathed in a makeshift turban.
</P>
<P>
The kitchen re-creates the scene on D-day, June 6, 1944, in this
Dorset port city from which thousands of American troops sailed for
France 50 years ago. The prices, however, are up-to-date -- 75 cents
for a cup of tea; $2 for a ham sandwich.
</P>
<P>
In nearby St. James Church, an old American flag hangs from the
choir balcony; the 48-star ensign was a gift from the U.S. Coast Guard
flotilla, known as the ``St. Bernards of Normandy,'' which shuttled on
rescue missions between Poole and France.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five miles west, in Weymouth, an impromptu museum of U.S.
Army memorabilia has been set up in a shopping arcade, a selection of
military items to mark the 50th anniversary that could keep the
interested visitor occupied for an hour or so.
</P>
<P>
Outside, a U.S. olive-drab jeep and a staff car, manned by locals
wearing period U.S. Army uniforms, tool around the port. Sitting in a
pub is Mike Wall, 79, a grizzled, bright-eyed American D-day veteran
who married a Weymouth girl and settled there permanently.
</P>
<P>
``My wife found me a great place here,'' said Wall, once a medic
with the 1st Infantry Division. ``I've been living happily ever
after.''
</P>
<P>
In the months before D-day, Americans seemed to be everywhere in
southern England: the troops who would land on the beaches of
Normandy; the supply corps to back them up; the sailors to ferry them
across the English Channel; the airmen to support them from above.
</P>
<P>
All in all, more than a million and a half Yanks made their way
through the southern counties of Hampshire, Dorset and Devon. They
were joined by an equal number of British and Canadian servicemen. The
Channel ports of Portsmouth, Southampton, Gosport, Weymouth, Portland
and Poole were the main embarkation points for the invasion.
</P>
<P>
In the initial D-day landings, 156,000 troops took part. By the end
of the invasion July 3, not quite one month later, 1 million troops
had been put ashore.
</P>
<P>
Now, as the 50th anniversary of the greatest amphibious landing in
history looms, local residents are bracing for a new flood of
outsiders. Counting on the nostalgia that southern England's towns,
villages and bases will evoke among invasion veterans and their
families, local tourism officials expect to lure back this summer
about 350,000 visitors, many of them from the United States and
Canada. Hotels, pubs, museums, exhibitions, resorts, transport
companies -- all hope to capitalize on the commemoration.
</P>
<P>
Portsmouth alone expects 70,000 visitors on June 4 and 5 to watch
Queen Elizabeth II, on board the royal yacht Britannia, review the
fleet with President Clinton, kings, queens and politicians -- and then
sail as part of a massive flotilla for the Normandy coast to take part
in ceremonies June 6.
</P>
<P>
U.S. warships will pay courtesy calls to the Channel ports of
southern England between June 2 and 5.
</P>
<P>
Local organizers are supported by the Ministry of Defense and
veterans associations, which are helping with military events, as well
as the Department of National Heritage, which is underwriting some
less martial observances.
</P>
<P>
In British Prime Minister John Major's words, the 50th anniversary
is ``a huge national event.''
</P>
<P>
``D-day was not just about those who took part on the day,'' Major
said. ``It was made possible by the effort and sacrifice of men and
women throughout the forces, throughout industry and throughout our
nation.''
</P>
<P>
Major decreed that church bells ``from St. Paul's Cathedral to the
smallest rural parish'' would peal on the eve of D-day's anniversary.
</P>
<P>
But the prime minister's efforts to make the anniversary a national
occasion have not been without controversy. Veterans complained about
the carnival nature of some of the events. As a result, the
observances have been muted and made less triumphal. And some events -- 
a Spam-frying contest to recall wartime rations, for instance -- were
summarily dropped.
</P>
<P>
The national Tourism Board has published and circulated a detailed
guide to about 350 commemorative events in southern England and
Normandy; there are about 500 events nationally. Dozens of other
brochures have been prepared focusing on various aspects of the D-day
observances and history; for example, ``Americans in Dorset,'' the
story of U.S. forces based there during the invasion buildup.
</P>
<P>
Tourism officials are not shy about promoting their attractions.
``Selling the South'' has become the D-day anniversary slogan for the
Southern Tourist Board, which has established a full-time D-day
coordinator in New York and a national information hot line in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
``We hope to realize an extra $9 million in tourism revenue from
the commemoration,'' said Peter Smith of the tourist board. ``We hope
spending by American and Canadian visitors alone will top $3
million.''
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
The variety of exhibits and observances is staggering. Here is a
small sampling:
</P>
<P>
-- Sightseeing flights in a DC-3 over former bases -- or Normandy -- 
from Bournemouth.
</P>
<P>
-- Radio D-day in Poole and Christchurch, which will broadcast for 12
hours a day, re-creating wartime news bulletins and music.
</P>
<P>
-- A parade, church service and wreath-laying at the American
memorial in Portland.
</P>
<P>
-- A display in Lyme Regis about the memories of U.S. troops who
trained in the town.
</P>
<P>
-- The largest display of wartime vehicles ever assembled -- 1,100
tanks, trucks, jeeps, motorcycles, even a locomotive -- in Portsmouth.
</P>
<P>
-- A display at Southwick House in Southwick, which served as the
forward headquarters for the commanders of ``Operation Overlord,'' as
the invasion was formally known: American Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower
and British Gen. Bernard Law Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, BBC-TV is tooling up for its biggest outside
broadcasting operation since the wedding of the Prince and Princess of
Wales in 1981. The anniversary events in the Channel and Normandy will
receive 13 hours of live coverage.
</P>
<P>
About 55 cameras will be positioned in Portsmouth for the opening
commemorative services on June 4 and 5. And the Channel crossing will
be transmitted from the pitching decks of ships carrying dignitaries
and veterans to Sea King helicopters above and thence to the nation's
television sets.
</P>
<P>
Such has been the mounting interest in the events and memorabilia
of 50 years ago that groups such as the Southern Tourist Board are
preparing to gear up all over again -- for next year's 50th anniversary
of Victory in Europe Day.

 RENO AT LARGE: It's Season Finale for Dominance of TV's Big Three 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For its sheer audacity, Rupert Murdoch's lightning raid of the CBS
affiliate base this week was a corporate coup of the first magnitude.
</P>
<P>
It is the more so because he pulled it off so cheaply and because
it comes so soon after he snatched rights to the National Football
League at a price so high he very nearly accomplished the perverse
miracle of televising professional football at a loss. And, of course,
it comes only four years after a brush with bankruptcy so close that
on cold days Murdoch must still feel the hot breath of the wolves who
were ready to liquidate his empire until an obscure bank in
Pittsburgh, one of the smallest of his legion of creditors, at the
last minute agreed to roll over its minuscule chunk of his
indebtedness.
</P>
<P>
If, 20 years ago, you'd been asked to name the most unassailable
corporate oligarchy in America, you'd probably have said CBS, NBC and
ABC. The nation had three commercial television networks -- not one,
not two, not five -- because, well, they got there first, had a lock on
broadcasting licenses in the richest markets, enjoyed a pervasive
influence in Congress, at the Federal Communications Commission and
within a succession of presidencies, and generated an unending and
highly predictable stream of profits for their shareholders. Risk
didn't exist to the extent that the networks ran a race in which the
worst that could happen was to come in a profitable third.
</P>
<P>
People in the industry still fondly remember the glory days of
expense accounts so generous that everybody could imagine they were
living close to scales that today are reserved for a smaller but
richer band of glamour generators in a war for ratings that has lost a
lot of its depth.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, who would have imagined that the first successful challenge
to this system, this citadel of power, this inherently American
arrangement, this fixture in American living rooms as culturally
ubiquitous and seemingly permanent as the nation's sofas, floor lamps
and wing chairs, would be an Australian capitalist with an apparently
admirable family life, mildly reactionary political leanings,
impeccable taste in vulgarity, an alarming disposition to borrow money
in volumes his competitors wouldn't dare contemplate, and a record of
not overly caring about the enemies he makes.
</P>
<P>
The thing about Murdoch that confuses most of his critics and
infuriates his most vitriolic disparagers is that he doesn't serve
them with platters of the sort of buffoonery that make Donald Trump or
Ross Perot targets that loom to their tormentors like the broad side
of a barn. He is well spoken in his public utterances. He does not
crave the artificial respectability that could easily have been
arranged by Margaret Thatcher sending him to the House of Lords. He
will, unself-consciously, arrange to become a U.S. citizen as easily
as young Wall Street lawyers go to Brooks Brothers in slavish
imitation of their senior partners. But he does not ask us to believe
anything of him that doesn't ring true, however bloodless.
</P>
<P>
Besides, those people who have for 40 years dreamed that the
television might mature into something resembling the diversity,
originality and cultural richness of the printed world, have, perhaps,
been asking too much of a medium that requires less human
concentration and a shorter attention span than a pinball machine.

 Vladivostok: Lawlessness and Commercial Promise (Vladivostok) 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Lee Hockstader 
</P>
<P>
(c) 1994, The Washington Post 
</P>
<P>
VLADIVOSTOK, Russia -- Rising on craggy, fog-shrouded hills from
Golden Horn Bay, Vladivostok is like a carnival mirror's distorted
image of Russia itself: distended in its lawlessness, misery and
disorientation, but also in its gaudy new wealth and commercial
promise.
</P>
<P>
This is the capital of Russia's Rough and Ready East, a port city
seven times zones and 5,700 miles from Moscow that has been as
thoroughly transformed as any spot in the former empire in the 2½
years since the Soviet Union's demise.
</P>
<P>
It is in Vladivistok, farther east than any major city in mainland
Asia, that Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Russia's greatest living writer,
will arrive Friday like some latter-day Rip Van Winkle after 20 years'
exile in the West. Here he will have his first glimpse of Russia's
kaleidoscopic transition to free-market capitalism in all its raucous,
lurid, hopeful colors.
</P>
<P>
``We're like a decaying organism, beset by parasites,'' said Yuri
Didenko, director of Vladivostok's huge fishing fleet, one of the
world's largest. But after railing at Moscow's callousness and
Russia's lost dignity, he captured the tough optimism of the place by
concluding: ``I'm upbeat. The geography of Vladivostok allows us to
hope it will be a center for business for East Asia and the Pacific
Rim.''
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1860 to block China's expansion to the Sea of Japan,
Vladivostok (the name means ``Possess the East'') boomed after the
Trans-Siberian Railway linked it with Moscow in 1903. As the home of
the Soviet Pacific Fleet, Vladivostok was a closed military camp after
World War II, forbidden not only to foreigners who might spy on the
bristling warships and weaponry but even to Soviet citizens without
special permission. Coddled by subsidies from Moscow and anchored by
the navy, military factories and the fishing fleet, the city glided
along in splendid isolation but for a 1975 summit between President
Gerald R. Ford and Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev.
</P>
<P>
Since it was opened officially to the outside world Jan. 1, 1992,
Vladivostok has made up for lost time, turning to the outside world
with a vengeance. As Moscow's influence wanes, Seattle and Seoul are
the new points of reference for Vladivostok's hustling traders.
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola is selling big, tripling forecast sales and leaving
distributors pleading for more. U.S. Peace Corps volunteers are
offering seminars on commercial banking, Italians are building a new
airport, Australians operate the best restaurant in town, and Chinese
workmen recently refurbished a $220-a-night hotel.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of joint ventures with Japanese, South Korean, Chinese and
American firms are underway, jockeying for market share and the chance
of future profits. Flights are planned or already operating to link
the city with Alaska and Japan. And in a red-brick church atop a hill,
an American Catholic priest is hearing confessions in a room that for
decades was a Communist Party archive for top-secret documents,
complete with electronic sensors on the windows to thwart break-ins.
</P>
<P>
Signs of new money are everywhere, from the stylishly dressed women
downtown to the swanky new apartment buildings on the outskirts, where
luxury duplex condominiums are on sale at $80 a square foot. Thousands
of white Japanese sedans -- the tax-free booty of returning merchant
sailors, who sell them at a quick profit -- clog the narrow streets in
epic rush hours.
</P>
<P>
But, having thrown off the yoke of communist control so abruptly,
the city is beset by outsized economic and social problems, more
severe than those of most cities in Russia. As fat subsidies from
Moscow dry up, huge defense plants that used to churn out navigational
systems and warplanes are switching over to TVs and automatic bowling
pin setters for Asian markets -- but not fast enough to avoid mounting
layoffs and unpaid workers.
</P>
<P>
Alongside the newly rich, a new class of unemployed and
impoverished is rapidly taking shape. City officials say a third of
Vladivostok's 700,000 civilians are living below the poverty line.
Prices, the highest in Russia, soared last year as annual inflation
here reached 1,300 percent, nearly half again the national average.
</P>
<P>
The emerging extremes of wealth and poverty are fueling a wave of
crime and corruption, including a murder rate that has jumped by five
times in five years and now rivals Washington's. The crime rate is
three times the national average, and the tough guys are having a
field day.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Bachurin, 31, an entrepreneur whose business leverage
includes a 12-gauge ``Vinchester'' and 20 stocky enforcers, controls
the local Chinese market, where merchants from across the border
peddle cheap track suits, plastic shoes and video games. ``The Russian
mafia is a good mafia,'' he said after displaying his shotgun for a
visitor in the middle of the crowded entryway to his market.
</P>
<P>
Tall and lean, with a close-cropped blond beard, Bachurin is a
former gold miner who now strolls around in a double-breasted red
blazer, chalk-striped flannel pants and long black leather coat -- when
he isn't in jail trying to beat one rap or another. ``My bodyguards,''
he said, ``can kill anyone. They can do this perfectly, because I
trained them myself.''
</P>
<P>
In the face of this explosion of disorder, the authorities are
swamped. The Vladivostok police force, which has just two computers,
is hiring hundreds of new cops. City prosecutors, lacking any official
cars, ride trolleys to their investigations.
</P>
<P>
``In the United States, you passed this racketeering stage long
ago,'' said Chief Prosecutor Vyacheslav Yaroshenko. ``We're just
entering it.''
</P>
<P>
Alexander Kuchinski, a young scientist who was a precinct chief for
a former mayor, said the new city authorities are thoroughly corrupt,
bent on ``attracting foreigners only for their personal profit.''
</P>
<P>
But in the long run, he said, Vladivostok will make it. ``Sooner or
later the new, business-minded people will win,'' he said. ``The old
guard is trying to keep control, but I think and hope that sooner or
later we'll get rid of them. New forces are growing fast here.''

 New Secret Police Worries Some Palestinians in Jericho (Jericho) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
JERICHO, West Bank
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an old public works building, Palestinian
men sit in the stifling heat dressed in revolvers, white shirts and
ties -- the latter a sure sign they are not locals. They give each
visitor a hard, probing look.
</P>
<P>
This is the new West Bank headquarters of the Palestinian secret
police, whose quick appearance on the scene rings -- for some -- an
ominous note among the celebrations over Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
``They are aiming at people like me. There is no question,'' said
Riyad Malki, an engineering professor identified with a group opposed
to Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction of the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
</P>
<P>
The dictatorships that abound in the Middle East often use secret
police -- ``muhabarat'' in Arabic -- to do the dirty work of eliminating
opposition to their regimes: eavesdropping, wiretapping, midnight
arrests, torture, and sometimes political assassination.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians here have not been reassured by the selection of
Jabril Rajoub to head the secret police in Jericho.
</P>
<P>
Few wish to speak for attribution of the man who spent 17 years in
Israeli prisons and six years in exile, where he is reputed to have
helped direct attacks against both Israelis and Palestinian foes.
</P>
<P>
``Everybody's afraid. The guy's a tough cookie,'' said one
well-connected Palestinian. Said another: ``He's the one in charge of
`dirty deeds.' Watch out for him.''
</P>
<P>
Rajoub, 41, paints a different picture of himself and his force.
</P>
<P>
``I wouldn't call it muhabarat,'' he said. ``In the Third World,
that means terror, interrogation, imprisonment and so on. Our job is
to protect the inhabitants and ensure the rights of opposition to
express their views in a decent way.''
</P>
<P>
His force, he said, officially is called ``Preventive Security.''
He makes reference to operating under ``democratic principles,''
trying to assure Palestinians who fear a Fatah autocracy.
</P>
<P>
His men will be armed, and work in plainclothes. He declines to say
how many there will be. It will work throughout the West Bank. He
refuses to say how they will operate against the opposition -- if, for
example, they will disarm other Palestinian groups.
</P>
<P>
``I don't think we can solve these problems through the media,'' he
replies. ``How we deal with our people is our responsibility and our
job.''
</P>
<P>
The agreement with Israel to begin Palestinian autonomy in Jericho
and the Gaza Strip permits formation of Palestinian units for ``public
security'' and ``intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
Those units are supposed to be within the Palestinian Police force.
Rajoub said, however, the secret police report directly to PLO
Chairman Arafat. Later, he acknowledged he also will report to Mesbah
Hanafi Sakr, a mysterious PLO ``general'' said to have hidden from the
Israelis for 27 years in the Gaza Strip, and whom few people say they
have ever met.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Rajoub is curt to questions about his activities during six years
of exile.
</P>
<P>
``Why do you ask such questions,'' he replied, irritated.
</P>
<P>
Rajoub returned to the West Bank last week to a hero's welcome. He
was imprisoned for life at age 17 for a grenade attack against an
Israeli army truck. He became a leader inside prison, where he learned
Hebrew and English and eventually became a representative of the
prisoners to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
He was released in a large prisoner-swap deal in 1985, and spent
three years working with Faisal al-Husseini in East Jerusalem. In
1988, he was deported by Israel, and he said he spent the rest of the
time in Tunis.
</P>
<P>
Israelis believe his job while in Tunis was to organize Fatah
operations in the West Bank and within Israel.
</P>
<P>
According to Yigal Carmon, former advisor to the Israeli government
on terrorism, Rajoub was one of those involved in a plot to recruit an
Israeli to murder of top officials of the Israeli government,
including Yitzhak Rabin, then defense minister and now prime minister.
The murder plan was foiled before an attempt was made.
</P>
<P>
``I guess Mr. Rabin doesn't take it personally,'' he said of the
government's approval of Rajoub's return.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Israel agreed to the creation of a security force in hopes it will
be like the Israeli secret service -- the Shabak -- and act against
extreme opposition groups to stop attacks on Israelis.
</P>
<P>
``This is not our duty,'' declares Rajoub. ``If Israel asks for
full and total security, we can assure that only if we have full and
total authority over our land, which we do not.''
</P>
<P>
If they caught a Palestinian who attacked Israelis, they would not
turn the suspect over to Israeli authorities, he said: ``It's not
mentioned in the agreement.''
</P>
<P>
``Our relationship with the Israelis is not one of friends,'' he
said last week, in explaining why there would be ``no coordination''
between his forces and those of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Other Palestinians believe Rajoub's main purpose will be to assert
control over opposition for the benefit of Fatah, not Israel.
</P>
<P>
``He will do those things that are not known, so that nobody will
be accountable,'' said Ghassan Khatib, who is identified with the
opposition Palestinian People's Party.
</P>
<P>
Malki -- from another group at odds with Arafat, the Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine -- said it is telling that Arafat
installed a security apparatus even before a civil government is
formed.
</P>
<P>
``I fear a lot about the future,'' he said. The secret police
``will be observing the people, watching everybody. They will stop any
protest, any opposition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
``I have been threatened three times in the last two years that my
place will be in the prison'' when Fatah authorities take control, he
said.
</P>
<P>
``In the last 10 or 20 years, I didn't really feel my life was
threatened,'' he said. ``Now the possibility is becoming real. These
are people who don't really mind eliminating their own.''

 Foreign Policy Missteps Hurt Clinton's Standing at Home (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Clinton, who has staked his presidency on
achieving bold domestic policy goals, suddenly appears to be
jeopardizing his political future with his handling of U.S. foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
The evidence is accumulating: Some of Clinton's poll ratings are
wilting; Republicans -- including former President Bush and GOP
presidential prospects for 1996 -- are pounding him and discontent is
spreading on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
And with foreign policy dilemmas plaguing him around the globe,
stretching from Haiti to Bosnia to North Korea and China, the future
offers the president little hope for relief.
</P>
<P>
Amid preparations for Clinton's trip to Europe next week to
commemorate the 50th anniversary of D-Day and to bolster strained
relationships with Western allies, some advisers wonder whether the
president might have underestimated the importance of foreign policy
while he was lavishing attention on domestic issues.
</P>
<P>
``I can envision a Republican candidate in 1996, someone like
(former Defense Secretary) Dick Cheney or (former Secretary of State)
Jim Baker, who campaigns on the slogan: `It's foreign policy, stupid,'
'' fretted a veteran of Clinton's 1992 campaign.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Republicans are already on the attack. ``Our leadership
around the world is being eroded by a stop-and-start policy of
hesitancy,'' Bush said at a GOP fund-raiser in Milwaukee last week,
according to a report in the Milwaukee Sentinel newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., a potential presidential
contender in 1996, mocked Clinton's recent 90-minute televised news
conference on international affairs. ``You shouldn't have to have a
television show with someone scripting the answers to demonstrate what
you know about leadership,'' Dole said at a party rally in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
The basic grievance against Clinton is this: In dealing with an
array of problems abroad, such as the bloody conflict in Bosnia, the
intransigence of the military regime in Haiti, the nuclear threat from
North Korea and human rights violations in China, he seems to have
talked loudly but carried a small stick.
</P>
<P>
``I continue to look for new solutions,'' the president has said in
his own defense. His supporters blame his difficulties on the
turbulent state of post-Cold War diplomacy, which has forced him to
sail on uncharted seas. While some Americans are urging him to steer
clear of foreign crises, others are demanding stronger action.
</P>
<P>
``You're damned if you do and damned if you don't,'' argued
Democratic National Chairman David Wilhelm. ``These are tough and
difficult situations.''
</P>
<P>
``The president is getting a bad rap,'' said House Speaker Thomas
S. Foley, D-Wash., who contends that Clinton does not get the credit
that he deserves for winning congressional approval of the North
American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Likening present conditions to the chaotic years following World
War II, Foley noted that it took President Harry S. Truman nearly two
years to develop policies for dealing with the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
But some analysts warn that Clinton's penchant for wheeling and
dealing -- contrasted with Truman's characteristic bluntness and
decisiveness -- can backfire in foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
``In foreign policy, it's important to present a firm image,'' said
Princeton University presidential scholar Fred Greenstein. ``With
Clinton, it's like globs of mercury; he's all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
Clinton's task is not an easy one. ``In the post-Cold War era, no
one knows what foreign policy ought to be,'' conceded Leslie Gelb, a
former State Department official in the Jimmy Carter administration.
Gelb now serves as president of the Council on Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
Yet Clinton's critics argue that the president is making the job
more difficult with his inconsistencies.
</P>
<P>
``You can't go Chinese menu week by week on foreign policy and
expect the American people to support you,'' said Hodding Carter III,
who was spokesman for the State Department during the Carter
administration.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's policies are drawing fire across the political spectrum.
From the right, House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., scoffs at
Clinton's initiative for dealing with the potential flood of refugees
from Haiti by establishing seaborne processing centers.
</P>
<P>
``There is a level of sloppiness about this administration that is
kind of scary,'' the conservative Georgia congressman said.
</P>
<P>
From the left, Maurice Paprin, head of the liberal-oriented Fund
for New Priorities, left a recent White House briefing convinced that
U.S. policy toward Haiti is ``as unclear and muddy as it was before.''
</P>
<P>
The president seemingly raised the political stakes for his Haiti
policies recently when he offered a detailed justification for U.S.
invasion of that strife-torn island nation if economic sanctions do
not force the military government from office.
</P>
<P>
But if the Haitian regime stands firm despite the sanctions,
Clinton will have to risk launching a military assault with
unforeseeable consequences or face intensified complaints that he
lacks the will to manage foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Even longtime allies of the president, such as Rep. Dave McCurdy,
D-Okla., who chairs the Democratic Leadership Council, the centrist
group that helped propel Clinton to the presidency, have joined the
disapproving chorus.
</P>
<P>
``We have conducted ourselves abroad with an unsteady hand,''
McCurdy said in an address to the Commonwealth Club of San Francisco
last month. ``In Bosnia, blustery rhetoric faded into reluctant
diplomacy. ... On North Korea, we have been anything but decisive.''
</P>
<P>
Republicans warn that shifting positions on current problems can
create even more serious troubles in the future. ``To the extent that
you use up your credibility, then when you get into a real crisis
you'll pay the price,'' former Defense Secretary Cheney told members
of the National Retail Federation earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is already paying a political price for the controversies
surrounding his foreign policy, according to recent polls. Only 40
percent of those interviewed in a Washington Post-ABC News survey
released last week approved of his handling of foreign policy, against
53 percent who disapproved. The negative showing on foreign policy
apparently contributed to lowering the president's overall approval
rating to 51 percent, from 57 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
``Foreign policy is not just about foreign affairs, it's also an
opportunity for the president to display leadership capabilities in
the one arena in which he can do so with fewest challenges,'' said
Everett Carll Ladd, director of the Roper Center for Public Opinion
Research. ``We have loads of evidence that people form impressions of
presidents by what they see of them on the world stage.''
</P>
<P>
Underscoring Clinton's difficulties abroad, and conceivably
complicating them, are increasing signs of congressional restlessness
with his leadership on foreign affairs. The most striking example is a
Senate vote two weeks ago for an amendment ordering the president to
unilaterally lift the U.N.-imposed embargo on selling arms to Bosnia,
even if the United States' NATO allies do not agree.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the top Republican on the Senate
Appropriations subcommittee that oversees spending on foreign aid,
predicted more congressional involvement in foreign affairs on such
issues as curbing development of North Korea's nuclear capability and
granting ``most favored nation'' trade status to China.
</P>
<P>
``All of a sudden,'' McConnell said, ``an issue the president has
no interest in, and he thinks the American people aren't interested
in, is becoming a major political liability.''

 Health Care Still to Be Dealt With as Congress Goes Home 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The following editorial appeared in Thursday's Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
Congress goes home still trying to figure out how, if at all, to
restructure the health-care system.
</P>
<P>
With regard to at least one aspect of the problem -- cost
containment -- our own sense is that it has no choice. It has to act
somehow; the government can't afford the system as it stands. No payer
can.
</P>
<P>
Some members of Congress have said in the past that the way to
counter health-care costs -- the federal share, at any rate -- would be
to impose an entitlement cap. The cap would force the necessary cuts,
if not in health care, then in other entitlement programs to make room
for health care.
</P>
<P>
We've been among those opposed to a cap on grounds that it would be
a cop-out -- another broad promise to achieve great savings by cutting
specific programs in the future instead of cutting them up front. But
if Congress fails to provide for such cuts up front when given the
chance -- if it fails to enact a credible health-care-cost-containment
mechanism -- well, what's left but an entitlement cap? The cap becomes
harder to resist.
</P>
<P>
There's already a cap on the third of the budget subject to the
appropriations process. It's a crude device, but it's working pretty
well, forcing the administration and Congress to make choices they'd
otherwise finesse.
</P>
<P>
Cappers say there needs to be a similar ceiling on the entitlements
side of the budget, or else the deficit, so painfully reduced last
year, will soon start to rise again.
</P>
<P>
You can make a lot of arguments against such a cap. Entitlements
are a false category, an arbitrary lumping together of unlike programs
(though the same can of course be said of appropriations). The word is
a euphemism mainly for aid to the elderly in the form of Social
Security and the payment of health-care costs through Medicare and
Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
The health-care costs are the ones that are driving the budget.
They are the ones that should be contained, and other programs,
including the rest of the federal-support system for the poor, should
not be put at risk because of them.
</P>
<P>
Most cap proposals also leave out tax entitlements -- the
mortgage-interest deduction, for example. Those should be put at risk
as well.
</P>
<P>
A cap is also likely to produce not so much genuine savings as
shifts. Particularly in health care, costs now borne by the federal
government will simply be shifted to the states or private payers.
That reduces the deficit more than it helps the society; there's a
better way.
</P>
<P>
But if Congress won't do the right thing, which is to face up to
health-care costs directly, then maybe it ought to put a gun to its
own head in the form of an entitlement cap. The health-care problem is
also a budget problem. Unless you solve the problem of health-care
costs, you can't provide even the health care the country needs.
</P>
<P>
The members need to think about that amid the swirl of pressures
back home.

 BROADWAY NOTES: Russian Classic Coming to Broadway Next Year 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
``Weekend in the Country'' might be enough for Stephen
Sondheim's mismatched lovers in ``A Little Night Music,'' but Ivan
Turgenev sent his off on ``A Month in the Country.'' Before too many
months pass, New Yorkers can expect to get a new look at the Russian
classic in a production that is London's latest hit. Starring Helen
Mirren and John Hurt, it ends a brief sold-out run this weekend, but
producer Duncan C. Weldon plans to bring it to Broadway next February
or March. Mirren, Hurt and John Standing would repeat their roles,
along with director Bill Bryden and designer Hayden Griffin. London
critics gave Mirren's Turgenev portrayal high praise. ``She has taken
one of the great, yet most elusive of roles and made it entirely her
own,'' the Daily Mail said. Mirren's schedule -- a film this summer and
more of TV's ``Prime Suspect'' in the fall -- dictate the delay till
next year. Weldon said there may be a pre-Broadway run in Stamford,
Conn., where his possible partner, Alexander H. Cohen, has a theater,
and a post-Broadway date in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
SERIOUS SIMON: 
</P>
<P>
Accepting a lifetime achievement award at New Dramatists' annual
luncheon last week, Neil Simon was alternately playful and
philosophical. As he looked back over a career that produced 28 plays,
he said, ``I do realize it's not going to go on forever. (pause) This
speech may.'' No, he had said at the outset, he would be brief -- 
unless he got a lot of laughs. He got quite a few from the audience of
about 500, but throughout his talk there was a recurring seriousness,
vague hints of a career winding down.
</P>
<P>
He referred indirectly to the fact that his latest Broadway play,
``Laughter on the 23rd Floor,'' failed to attract a single Tony
nomination: ``As far as I'm concerned, all of them (in the cast) have
gotten Tony nominations -- from me. Unfortunately, you don't get to go
to the party.'' And he worried that playwrights are now an endangered
species. ``I came to the theater at the right time. I had a place to
learn and a place to fail. There's no place to fail now and you need
that. (pause) I'd better stop and tell a joke.'' And he did, but it
can't be repeated here -- that word, you know.
</P>
<P>
Introducing Simon, his longtime producer, Emanuel Azenberg,
recalled that during rehearsals for ``Broadway Bound,'' a scene wasn't
working. Simon noticed his concern and sent him a note, now framed on
his office wall: ``Don't worry. I know how to fix it.'' Later, they
were workshopping a Simon musical using Gershwin songs. It was
terrible, Azenberg said. So bad that Simon sent him a note, now also
hanging on his office wall: ``Worry. I don't know how to fix it.''
</P>
<P>
CASTING ABOUT: 
</P>
<P>
We're not going to see Judy Kuhn as the young love interest in
``Sunset Boulevard'' when Andrew Lloyd Webber's megamusical comes to
Broadway in the fall. In fact, she left the Los Angeles cast Sunday to
get ready for motherhood. Her first child is due in October.
Understudy Anastasia Barzee has taken over the role in L.A. No word
yet on who'll play it here ... As of June 7, the ``Blood Brothers''
will no longer be played by the brothers Cassidy. Understudy Philip
Lehl replaces David Cassidy and Ric Ryder takes over for Shaun
Cassidy. On the same day, Carole King steps into the role of their
mother, currently played by Petula Clark. Clark takes the road company
out in September -- first stop, Dallas ... Peter Bartlett, J.
Smith-Cameron, John Cunningham, Debra Messing and Mary Beth Peil head
the cast of the new Paul Rudnick play, ``The Naked Truth,'' now in
previews at the WPA Theater. The plot involves photography,
pornography and politics ... Dennis Parlato, seen recently in ``Hello
Again,'' replaces Howard McGillin in ``She Loves Me'' Tuesday.
Starting June 6, McGillin plays Molina, the gay window dresser in
``Kiss of the Spider Woman.''
</P>
<P>
ON THE RECORD: 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Judy Kuhn, her debut solo album is due out this summer:
a collection of Jule Styne songs on the Varese Sarabande label.
Another star from the original cast of the current ``She Loves Me''
revival, Sally Mayes, is also recording solo for Varese Sarabande.
With emphasis on the lyrics of Betty Comden and Adolph Green, the disc
is due in the fall. Mayes is also moonlighting this month and next
with late Saturday night shows at Eighty Eight's, the Greenwich
Village cabaret ... ``Ruthless,'' the musical about unbridled ambition
in a preteen actress, enjoyed a good Off-Broadway run here last season
but never made it into the recording studio. The show is having an
even better run at Beverly Hills' Canon Theater and getting an album
out of it too. Although the murder-minded moppet is now played at the
Canon by Kathryn Zaremba, the production's original star, Lindsay
Ridgeway, is on the just-released Varese Sarabande recording. Zaremba
is remembered here in the kinder, gentler guise of Annie Warbucks.
</P>
<P>
REVIVAL UPDATE: 
</P>
<P>
The Drama Desk's special award citing the 25-year record of York
Theater Company and producing director Janet Hayes Walker is prompting
a preview of their latest show, a revised version of Sondheim's
``Merrily We Roll Along,'' opening June 8. The cast of York's revival
will perform two numbers at the awards ceremony June 5 at the
Roundabout Theater. Carole King is also on the program ... American
Jewish Theater's revival of Jerry Herman's ``Milk and Honey'' is
proving enough of a box-office draw to warrant a month's extension.
The show, set to close this weekend, will now play through June 26.

 Will Arsenio's Exit Be a Wrap for Rap? (Hollywood) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
HOLLYWOOD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Arsenio Hall takes his final bow Friday night,
record company executives fear that the curtain may also drop on
urban-oriented music on the late-night talk-show circuit.
</P>
<P>
Officials at MCA, Epic and other labels said for the past 5½ years,
the syndicated ``Arsenio Hall Show'' provided a valuable national
outlet for urban music while other late-night hosts such as Johnny
Carson, Jay Leno and David Letterman focused on more traditional,
mainstream musical tastes.
</P>
<P>
``I'm really bummed,'' said Laura Hynes, vice president of artist
development and media relations for Tommy Boy Records, a New
York-based label specializing in rap and urban music.
</P>
<P>
``This show helped break a lot of our artists -- Naughty by Nature,
House of Pain, RuPaul, Queen Latifah,'' Hynes said. ``Before this
show, there was no national late-night outlet where a viewer could
tune in to see happening music that appealed to the segment of the
audience that liked rap or dance music.''
</P>
<P>
Even as Hall's ratings slipped in the last few years -- by 24
percent in the last year alone -- these executives and other observers
of the urban music scene maintained that his show never lost its
status as a desired gig for rap and rhythm blues artists to reach
their core young audience. An appearance on the Hall show often
translated into a boost in popularity and record sales -- as much as
400 percent, said Kim Jackwerth, director of television media for
Epic.
</P>
<P>
It was, said Ernie Singleton, president of MCA Records' black music
division, ``the single best platform for urban music, even better than
`Soul Train,' `Showtime at the Apollo' or the occasional Leno and
Letterman appearance.''
</P>
<P>
Hall not only gave visibility to established mainstream rappers and
groups such as Salt-N-Pepa, Arrested Development and Queen Latifah,
but also featured more controversial artists such as Snoop Doggy Dogg,
Dr. Dre, Cypress Hill, Tupac Shakur and Ice T.
</P>
<P>
Now, with Hall quitting after Friday's show, the music industry is
wondering if those artists will be able to ``get busy'' with Leno,
Letterman or Hall's expected replacement, Jon Stewart of MTV. The
opportunities to get a coveted slot on a late-night show will
certainly be slimmer, they agreed.
</P>
<P>
Reggie Miller, music editor of the Source, a rap and
hip-hop-oriented magazine, said, ``The overall vibe of Arsenio's show
was a party, and it was also family. It was a real symbol to appear on
Arsenio's show. There is definitely not another late-night show that
would devote an entire program to rap. I've seen that Jon Stewart has
a lot of music acts on his (MTV) show and he feels very contemporary,
but I doubt if any other show will be of Arsenio's essence.''
</P>
<P>
Another executive who asked not to be identified said there was a
perception in the music industry that Leno and Letterman were biased
against rap and urban music acts. ``They're white shows for white
audiences,'' said the official. ``Unless you have appeal to white
people, you're not going to get a booking on those shows.''
</P>
<P>
A spokesperson for ``The Tonight Show With Jay Leno'' disputed that
claim and other perceptions that Leno placed less of a priority on
urban-oriented music. ``We were the first to have on R. Kelly,'' said
the spokesperson. ``In the past, we've had Gang Starr, TLC and a
number of hip-hop artists. On June 2, we've got All 4 One booked.''
</P>
<P>
The spokesperson added that Leno's booking of rap and hip-hop
artists would not change due to Hall's departure. A spokesman for
Letterman could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Marla Kell Brown, producer of ``The Arsenio Hall Show,'' said she
does not believe the other late-night programs are biased against
urban artists.
</P>
<P>
``Initially, we were an alternative to Johnny Carson, who had a
whole different audience and didn't necessarily speak to the younger
generation,'' Brown said. ``It's more an issue of age than of black
and white. It's an issue of being uninformed.''
</P>
<P>
Some urban artists will get shots on the Letterman and Leno shows,
she predicted, ``but many will not have a place to go. There are only
so many slots available.'' And ``the other shows are not going to
change their format,'' she added. ``If you try too hard to be what
you're not, that looks strange, too.''
</P>
<P>
Brown said Hall, after all, was only doing what came naturally to
him.
</P>
<P>
``I always felt that there was this misconception by the media that
we were on the cutting edge,'' she said. ``We just brought out what
young America was listening to. In our first week, we had Bobby Brown
on as a guest. He had the No. 1 song in the country then -- `My
Prerogative' -- but he had never been on a late-night show. There just
wasn't a venue for artists like him to get their stuff out there. So
we were not cutting edge. We were just reflecting the mainstream of
young America.''
</P>
<P>
That reflection extended beyond the music scene, the producer said.
``There were actors and athletes that were very popular, but popular
in a world that was different than the world populated by the
producers of those other shows,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
While pessimistic, many of the urban music executives said they
were willing to give other talk shows the benefit of the doubt in
terms of the booking of rap and hip-hop artists.
</P>
<P>
``These musicians will have a place to go, but it just won't be the
same,'' said Lisa Jefferson, manager of West Coast press and artist
development for Elektra Entertainment. ``I don't know how hard it will
be for an artist to get on. It may take a Top 10 single. With Arsenio,
if he knew the group, he would put them on. Plus, it won't be the same
camaraderie. He will definitely be missed.''

 Here Is Possible From There 
 Nayo is an associate professor at Loyola (Calif.) Law School. 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I get the calls a couple of times each year. A local public junior
high school counselor, usually from a school boasting a ``mostly
minority'' student population, will ask me to speak at Career Day.
Unless my schedule is unyielding, I cannot resist the invitation. I am
a Role Model, capitalized: an African American woman with an advanced
degree who does work that many of the audience members have fantasized
about. I may be the first person of color some of the kids have seen
who does the work that I do. I may be the first real-life lawyer some
have ever seen. Having been there, I cannot resist going back.
</P>
<P>
I know that I have been invited because I represent possibility. My
information kit usually directs me to tell the students something
about the education I needed to become a law school professor. I am to
impress them with the hard work it will take to get from where they
are to where I am. They are at a crossroads, I am told, having to
decide what to do about the rest of their secondary education in order
to realize a dream or two. Some of them are considering whether to
continue their education at all.
</P>
<P>
Last fall, the Santa Monica, Calif., YWCA Career Day was at the
John Adams Middle School. The students were restless, wearing on the
patience of their teachers and vice principal. The other panelists
were a professional beach-volleyball player, a recreation supervisor
and an intimidating karate instructor with the fourth-degree black
belt. As befits our host, the panel was all female.
</P>
<P>
As I gathered my notes, I realized why I make the time to attend
career days: It is a grounding exercise. I do not want to forget that
my present self is the sum of my life. As much as career days give me
a chance to represent possibility to young African Americans, I also
get to remind myself, ``Here is very much possible from there.'' I
once was, in the language of social science, an economically
disadvantaged, single teen mother. Statistically, I should not be a
law-school professor, nor should my daughter be an only child or a
college graduate. These facts are vital elements of my discussion,
because the risk exists that some members of the audience are or will
become single teen parents. There is an equal likelihood that there
are many economically disadvantaged children at the school at which I
am speaking.
</P>
<P>
I tell them about my origins and my early parenthood, not merely as
cautionary tale, but also as an offering of hope. It is as important
to me to include unplanned parenthood in my presentation as it is to
point out how I got into college, what my grades were like or the
route I took from law student to law professor. It is part of my
objective of presenting possibility to these students: You can have a
life after early, unexpected parenthood. It will not be an easy life,
but it can be productive and fulfilling. There are innumerable sources
willing to suggest to them that they will fail in life. I like
offering the possibility that they will succeed.
</P>
<P>
I don't sugarcoat the teen parenting experience: Once I became a
parent, I gave up dating as it is traditionally perceived and deferred
a college education in favor of full-time employment until my daughter
was 8 and able (if not particularly willing) to accept an explanation
for our changed economic circumstances. I tell the students that my
daughter and I grew up together, that I was attending to the needs of
a child while just out of my own childhood. And I always identify the
life choices I made that were directed by the promise I made to myself
that my child's life would be better -- filled with more options and
possibilities -- than mine.
</P>
<P>
Nor do I forget to tick off the positives: Having a daughter gave
me great joy and purpose. I discovered that, to persuade this child
that she could do anything or be whatever she wanted, I had to live my
life in a way that affirmed that. It was not enough simply to tell her
that the world was her oyster if I, her primary role model, did not do
what I wanted. She was a powerful catalyst, propelling me through
college and graduate school, keeping me from remaining in a job that
bored me. And, my daughter has always been my most ardent fan and
strongest supporter.
</P>
<P>
She even helped me get through law school. She gave me a
life-saving study tip: When studying for long periods, take a two- to
five-minute break every hour. During this short break, wash your face,
make a doctor's appointment, prepare lunch, check the mail, check
airline ticket prices to Tahiti. Whatever you do, she advised me, get
out of the chair in which you are studying and move your brain to
something else. As promised, I came back from my breaks refreshed,
ready for work. I continue to pass this hint on. (It works for
bar-exam preparation as well.)
</P>
<P>
It is with wonder that I tell students that life is change and
growth, and what seems like a mistake can become an opportunity. I
remember how my high school guidance counselor responded to my
pregnancy. She suggested that I withdraw from my college-preparatory
public school for gifted and talented girls and enroll in vocational
school, where I could ``learn a trade and maybe find a husband and
father'' for me and my child. I ignored her and graduated with my
class; my mother brought my daughter to the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, surprised silence greets my reference to my teen
pregnancy. Usually, the students are more interested in my annual
income, whether I go to court, whether there is a test you have to
take to get into law school. Once a student asked if law-school
professors are ``real lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
Then there are the other times. For instance, in Santa Monica, a
student asked my favorite career-day question: What is my daughter
doing now?
</P>
<P>
She's living in Philadelphia, finishing her MBA, working in
mortgage banking. She is planning a July wedding. We are friends, she
calls four times a week, she is happy. These are the most affirming
facts of all.

 ROESSNER COMMENTARY: Jackie Moved Fast, but She Died Too Young 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Time was compressed and accelerated for Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis,
or so we'd like to think. Things just seemed to have an awful habit of
befalling her too soon and too quickly. It wasn't right. It wasn't
natural. As Teddy Kennedy eulogized:
</P>
<P>
``Jackie was too young to be a widow in 1963, and too young to die
now.''
</P>
<P>
She died at 64, which is way too young in my lexicon of denial. At
the very least, it's not the ``ripe old age'' in which we middle-aged
survivors are accustomed to seeking relief. They say this is the age
at which we begin scrutinizing obituaries. If that is so, Jackie's
death is the obituary page writ large.
</P>
<P>
A lot of people I know, especially those who were children when our
association between Jackie and the funeral hearse was forever forged,
are busily consulting our mortality calculators and computing how much
longer her death date gives us.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five years? Twenty?
</P>
<P>
A little more? A little less?
</P>
<P>
Whatever it is, it's not much. Certainly, it's not enough.
</P>
<P>
But then, as Teddy said, Jackie was ``too young to die.''
</P>
<P>
Phew.
</P>
<P>
It has been said the intensity of the public's mourning has to do
with our perception of Jackie as invincible, the perfect princess
whose wealth and bearing and eternal slimness and style enveloped her
in a kind of magic shield. Yes, she suffered; but look how nobly she
endured.
</P>
<P>
It has been said, too, that her passing is particularly painful
because it marks the passing of our youth and its seminal events. Even
the veteran broadcaster Sander Vanocur teared up while commenting on
her funeral Monday; the lights of his youth had gone out, he said,
never to be seen again.
</P>
<P>
For me, though, the sadness -- or is it the fear? -- is more banal.
It has more to do with the speed with which the cancer claimed her.
</P>
<P>
Diagnosed in January, gone in May. Can it really happen that
quickly? To a woman who ate right, exercised regularly, had the best
medical care her millions could buy? Can it happen this quickly, even
to her?
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Jackie's life seems unduly attenuated because she embraced
and embodied the length and breadth -- the sheer velocity -- of her
time. She was so many things, in such a short space.
</P>
<P>
The still photographs flash before us -- child equestrian,
debutante, adoring wife, glamorous first lady, grieving widow,
international swinger, stoic single mother, accomplished professional,
proud grandmother.
</P>
<P>
In such a short space, at such a breakneck pace, she created such a
kaleidoscope of images.
</P>
<P>
I tend to think of Jackie as part of a threesome of Kennedy wives -- 
she, Ethel and Joan forming a triumvirate of female possibility within
that testosterone-rich patriarchy of sports and politics.
</P>
<P>
A quarter-century after Bobby's death, Ethel remains his widow, a
matronly woman with a horde of children. After decades of drinking,
personal decay and finally a legal split from Teddy, Joan remains the
recovering alcoholic, the damaged divorcee behind the dark glasses.
</P>
<P>
But Jackie was never static. She continually transcended the
present and moved on. She was never stuck, never vanquished by the
Kennedy code any more than by the prying paparazzi. Somehow, Jackie
managed to accomplish what her counterparts couldn't. She changed.
</P>
<P>
It has been startling, in recent days, to hear her little-girl
voice explaining, back in 1962, how important it is for a woman to
worship her husband. It has been startling because it so sharply
contrasts with the sophisticated Doubleday editor who shared her Park
Avenue apartment with her ``companion of recent years.''
</P>
<P>
It has been startling, too, to see her walking one day in Central
Park, and then, just a week later, buried at Arlington.
</P>
<P>
Even in death, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis moved fast, which is, of
course, what we've all got to do in life. We've got to move fast, or
we'll miss it. We've got to grab on and let go, again and again. We've
got to change.
</P>
<P>
For the excruciating truth is that life is short, no matter how
long it lasts.

 Preferences in TV Shows Divide Sharply Along Racial Lines 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We may live in a wonderful world of color, but when it comes to
television, much of what we watch is still in black and white.
</P>
<P>
A quick remote-control journey through network prime time reveals a
lineup of programs divided by race. Most shows feature white
characters; a small but growing number star black performers; but very
few offer both in major roles.
</P>
<P>
Our viewing habits mirror those divisions. A recent breakdown of
Nielsen Media Research ratings showed a wide disparity between black
and non-black households in television viewing preferences.
</P>
<P>
For fall 1993, the two groups had completely different lists of top
10 prime-time programs, based on Nielsen ratings. Of the top 20, only
one show, ABC Monday Night Football, appeared on both lists, according
to BBDO, the New York advertising agency that analyzed the ratings.
</P>
<P>
And the preference gap is widening. In a similar survey eight years
ago, the top-20 lists for black and non-black audiences featured 15
programs that were on both.
</P>
<P>
One reason for the disparity in viewing habits is the greater
variety of program choices. Only a decade ago, there were just a
handful of shows featuring major black characters. For 1993-94, the
networks, led by Fox, offered more than 25 shows starring black people
or featuring them in major supporting roles.
</P>
<P>
``There's no mystery. Blacks now have more options than they did in
the old days,'' said BBDO Vice President Doug Alligood, who conducted
the survey.
</P>
<P>
People, no matter their age, race or socioeconomic status, are
attracted to programs featuring people of similar appearances or
circumstances, he said. For example, 13 of the top 20 programs favored
by African-Americans feature black people as stars, while supporting
roles are the best they can do in programs in the non-black top 20.
</P>
<P>
Alligood said television programs are meant to entertain, and that
it may not be wise to put too much weight into the differences in
viewing preferences.
</P>
<P>
Others are not as sanguine, however. They acknowledge that
differences in viewing habits by race and the small number of programs
with multiracial casts are symptoms of the divisions in our society.
</P>
<P>
However, television is too powerful a medium merely to reflect such
divisions. Its influence tends to amplify them, some said.
</P>
<P>
``To the extent that people take television as an indication of the
way people are in the world, it reinforces stereotypes. And there's a
lot of evidence that people take television as a reinforcement of the
world,'' said Clay Steinman, associate professor of communications
studies at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minn.
</P>
<P>
Television can be especially influential in matters of race, where
social divisions often keep whites and blacks from knowing much about
each other. White people, especially, often have little contact with
black culture, and can be swayed by characterizations of black people
on television, Steinman said.
</P>
<P>
However, the fact that people of different races may be attracted
to different programs won't necessarily harm society, said Esther
Bush, president and chief executive officer of the Urban League of
Greater Hartford.
</P>
<P>
``I don't think it divides us more. For African-Americans, it makes
sense that we're watching shows that have us in them,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
There are similar racial divergences in musical and reading
preferences, said William A. Edwards, chairman of the sociology
department at the University of San Francisco. They often reflect
different cultural upbringings and interests, which also can be found
when examining preferences based on education or income, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sanford Cloud Jr., president of The National Conference (formerly
National Conference of Christians and Jews), said the growing number
of programs featuring black characters is good, because it provides an
opportunity to show a greater range of black culture and experiences.
</P>
<P>
``If there's only one program on, that's what Americans believe
those people are like,'' said Cloud.
</P>
<P>
Still, the content of shows must be analyzed, Cloud said, and there
are troubling signs that television doesn't show the full range.
</P>
<P>
For example, black stars are featured almost exclusively on comedy
programs. Filmmaker Spike Lee recently criticized such depictions as a
return to minstrel shows, while Charles Dutton, the star of Fox's
critically praised ``Roc,'' has complained that the networks do not
support serious shows featuring African-American characters.
</P>
<P>
Programs featuring black characters often receive greater scrutiny.
For example, ``The Cosby Show'' on NBC received great ratings and
reviews, but was knocked by some for offering a sanitized vision of
African-American life.
</P>
<P>
The mistake, Bush and others said, is when viewers look to
entertainment programs for depictions of real life, especially if they
rely on few other information sources.
</P>
<P>
``TV doesn't depict anyone's family'' realistically, no matter the
race, said Robert Gluck, vice president and general manager of
WTIC-TV, the Fox affiliate in Hartford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
Steinman said the white audience, because of its much larger size,
always must be taken into consideration by programmers, but that the
reverse is not true. For that reason, presentations of
African-Americans that do not square with white perceptions can have
difficulty getting on the air, he said.
</P>
<P>
Crossover programs, those that feature both blacks and whites in
prominent roles, generally have not performed well in the ratings and
are rarely seen on television. One exception is the hourlong CBS
drama, ``In the Heat of the Night.''
</P>
<P>
Some programs, such as ``Dave's World'' on CBS, feature a black
character, but ``he is basically a visitor'' on what is perceived to
be a white show, Alligood said.
</P>
<P>
``What real-life image portrayal there is (on television) is that
we live in separate communities and live separate lives,'' Cloud said.
``If producers showed more mixing, it might make us mix more.''
</P>
<P>
Michael Brown, professor of recreation and leisure studies at Old
Dominion University in Norfolk, Va., said that airing a show with an
all-black cast follows a common marketing practice of targeting groups
according to shared characteristics, such as age, sex or income.
</P>
<P>
The plus is that the networks realize they must serve the black
audience, which watches a lot of television. The same situation should
eventually come true for other minority groups, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
By marketing to specific groups, however, ``they don't feel like
developing a multiculturally diverse show,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Brown sees the popularity of shows featuring all-black casts as
partly a reaction against programming in the 1970s and early 1980s,
when black people started being featured more regularly, but often
within a white cultural environment.
</P>
<P>
An obvious example of that phenomenon was ``Diff'rent Strokes,'' a
show in which a rich white man adopts two poor black boys.
</P>
<P>
According to the BBDO ratings survey, there is not a wide
preference gap between races for some programs, such as CBS's ``60
Minutes,'' ABC's ``Home Improvement'' or ``Roseanne'' or NBC's ``The
Fresh Prince of Bel Air.''
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Alligood, who wrote the BBDO report, said racial differences in
viewing habits are far less pronounced for certain age groups.
According to the BBDO survey, the top-20 lists of black and non-black
youths between the ages of 12 and 17 share 10 programs.
</P>
<P>
``When it comes to television, racial differences are secondary to
generational differences,'' he said. While those interviewed believe
that television should do a better job in educating the public about
different races and cultures, they said viewers also have a
responsibility to find ways to learn about others.
</P>
<P>
``If we learn about each other from television, we're in a lot of
trouble,'' Alligood said.

 Making a Divorce Work for Parents, Children 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lately, more voices are being raised in favor of staying together
for the sake of the children. The notion of a ``good divorce'' when
children are involved seems a selfish rationalization left over from
the human potential movement of the '60s.
</P>
<P>
Yet, as the average length of marriage has dropped to six years and
serial monogamy becomes more popular, many individuals and some
jurisdictions are pursuing a '90s definition of the good divorce -- 
also for the sake of the children.
</P>
<P>
Like many divorced parents, Geoff, now 35, and Barbara Lipscomb,
37, couldn't see past their own emotions in the beginning. Married for
five years, they separated three years ago. At the time, their son,
Colin, was only 2.
</P>
<P>
``It was bitter and angry in the beginning,'' recalled Barbara, who
had planned a future for herself as a stay-at-home mom. ``I was angry
he left and shocked, rejected and hurt.''
</P>
<P>
There were practical things to take care of: lawyers, moving, a new
preschool, a new job, new child-care arrangements.
</P>
<P>
And there was Colin. ``I think it's heartbreaking for the child.
The hardest part was to hear him say, `I wish you and me and Daddy all
lived together.' ''
</P>
<P>
It took nine months before she would even agree to talk with Geoff.
With the help of a court-appointed mediator, they ironed out custody
and visitation disagreements and now talk about their son's needs and
development at least three times a week. They attend school events
together. They say they never criticize each other in front of their
child. They have even spent Christmas together.
</P>
<P>
``Most people, I think, are surprised,'' Geoff said.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to popular belief, a number of parents have learned ways
to continue raising their children together effectively, said
Constance Ahrons, associate director of the Marriage and Family
Therapy Program at the University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
``The truth is, 50 percent of divorces do not do long-term damage
to children or adults,'' said Ahrons, whose book ``The Good Divorce''
(HarperCollins) is scheduled to be published in the fall.
</P>
<P>
Ahrons said she studied 98 families in the Midwest that she found
through court records. She interviewed them three times over five
years, the last in 1985. The children were not interviewed.
</P>
<P>
``About 50 percent fell into what is the negative stereotype,'' she
said. ``They were still angry or litigating. But 50 percent were not
doing that. They got on with trying to resolve it, finding ways to
effectively handle their parenting.
</P>
<P>
``The research clearly indicates the damage done to children is
done in bad marriages prior to divorce, not so much the divorce
itself,'' said Ahrons, who struggled to attain a civilized divorce
herself. Although she and her ex-husband never became friendly after
the divorce, they did manage a holiday dinner or two and when their
daughter married, walked her down the aisle together.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Lessening the impact of divorce is complicated. The overriding rule
is that children should never become caught in the cross-fire between
the parents. They need to be reassured that they are not the cause of
the divorce and that while there will be changes, both parents will
still love them and take care of them.
</P>
<P>
One of the more important tools in a good divorce, Ahrons said, is
compromise.
</P>
<P>
Colin sees his father every other weekend plus Wednesday nights.
Barbara learned to consult Geoff on arrangements she made, such as
changing preschools. Geoff sends the child support check on time. When
Colin is sick, sometimes he takes the day off to stay with him.
</P>
<P>
More parents can have civilized divorces if society expects them
to, Ahrons believes.
</P>
<P>
Several jurisdictions are experimenting with mandating ``parenting
plans'' when couples with children divorce. Under the state of
Washington's 1987 Parenting Act, divorcing parents must file a
parenting plan that delineates a dispute resolution process,
allocation of decision-making authority and residential provisions for
holidays, birthdays, vacations and other special events. Exceptions
are allowed in cases of abuse.
</P>
<P>
While mandated parenting plans resemble the old joint custody and
visitation arrangements, supporters believe that the new language will
help parents see their roles in terms of responsibility rather than of
control.
</P>
<P>
Geoff said that in some ways, a good divorce is not that much
different from a good marriage: ``It takes a lot of work.''

 The Painful Fact Is Women Know Truth When We Trip Over It 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are things in this life that are true. Absolutely true.
Children think they know these things. Men talk like they do. But only
women really know.
</P>
<P>
Here, then, is another glimpse inside the store of knowledge that
has come to be known as True Facts. As always, I am grateful to those
who have made these true facts known to me.
</P>
<P>
-- Don't even look for the Scotch tape. Your children have already
used it all up.
</P>
<P>
-- ``My mom lets me.'' The most common phrase uttered by a child to
an adult not his parent. Almost always a lie.
</P>
<P>
-- It is a common misconception that sleep-over means sleeping over
at someone else's house. It does not. It means that after your child
spends the night at another child's house, you have to do the sleeping
part of it over sometime that next afternoon or your child will not be
fit to live with.
</P>
<P>
-- If you go back to bed after your children leave for school and
ignore that ringing phone, it will be the school calling to tell you
your child is sick and needs to come home.
</P>
<P>
-- Where are all the spoons? Probably the same place all the other
socks are.
</P>
<P>
-- Old Russian proverb: Women do everything. Men do the rest.
</P>
<P>
-- You know your child has reached adolescence when the field trip
permission slips come home with ``My parent will not be able to
chaperon'' already checked off.
</P>
<P>
-- Only mothers put the caps back on the markers. That's because they
paid for them.
</P>
<P>
-- Men don't sing in church. Women would feel bad for the organist if
they didn't.

 Marry in Haste ... Repent in Leisure 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You might well wonder what Julia Roberts, Shannen Doherty, Drew
Barrymore, Bette Midler and a 42-year-old Chicago psychologist named
Kate Wachs have in common.
</P>
<P>
As it turns out, all married impulsively. Quickly -- and in major
defiance of every mom's maxim: Gee, honey, maybe you should get to
know this person you're about to marry before you actually get
married.
</P>
<P>
Barrymore's marriage to tavern owner Jeremy Thomas lasted about a
month. Noting that she and Thomas had not so much as cohabited before
their marriage, Barrymore said at the time of her wedding, ``I guess
we're doing it the old-fashioned way. Kind of.''
</P>
<P>
Doherty and Ashley Hamilton split up six months after they tied the
knot at a picnic in her back yard. Their courtship reportedly lasted
only two or three weeks. (The marriage, if not the divorce, surprised
even Doherty's publicist.)
</P>
<P>
In a positive dream state while Lovett was removing her blue garter
at their wedding reception, Roberts remarked: ``He makes me so happy.
He's so good to me.'' These days, heated tabloid speculation
notwithstanding, Roberts and Lovett insist that they're still wildly
in love.
</P>
<P>
When Midler and Martin von Haselberg reconnected in October 1984,
after having met briefly once before, sparks flew. Two months later,
they were heading to Las Vegas to get married. This winter, Midler and
von Haselberg will celebrate their 10th wedding anniversary. They have
one child, a daughter, Sophie.
</P>
<P>
As for Wachs, her two-year union with seaman Don Donner is so
successful that in some circles of the American Psychological
Association -- whose members, you might think, ought to know better -- 
getting married impulsively is now known with some admiration as
getting hitched ``Dr. Kate-Style.''
</P>
<P>
``That means quick,'' Wachs said. She and Donner met one evening at
the grocery store, after he tracked the scent of her perfume (Paloma
Picasso) down the aisles.
</P>
<P>
``You should get some for your girlfriend,'' said Wachs, no fool.
</P>
<P>
``What girlfriend?'' Donner said.
</P>
<P>
By morning, they were engaged.
</P>
<P>
The short life span of many high-profile impulse marriages has
given the practice a seriously bad name. Hasty marital decisions make
waste-y divorce proceedings, the logic goes -- often correctly.
Infatuation is an evil drug, your sensible maiden aunt warned. Feels
great while you're in its spell. When the effect wears off, look out.
</P>
<P>
But while admitting that they have no vast data pool to draw on,
many experts wonder if instant marriages deserve their reputation as
an automatic formula for disaster.
</P>
<P>
Love-at-first-sight is a treasured myth of our culture, these
social scientists point out. The mysterious stranger is an ongoing
icon. Passion's a more enjoyable route to a raised heartbeat than
fishing or an aerobic workout. And spontaneity is exhilarating, a rush
that rules out reason.
</P>
<P>
Put these elements together, said Cambridge, Mass., psychologist
Barry Dym, and you've got the recipe for an impulse marriage.
</P>
<P>
And, Dym said, ``I kind of doubt that they have any worse chance
than anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
In fact, he added, ``since the chemistry is so strong, they may
have a better chance.''
</P>
<P>
In Austin, Texas, psychologist Pat Love was the first to agree. The
Wachs-Donner scenario, for example, seemed perfectly plausible to
Love, who once entered an upscale Dallas watering hole with two close
female friends. Love and her friend Maisie went to find a table. Their
friend Sue, meanwhile, found a new husband.
</P>
<P>
``By the time Maisie and I found a place to sit down, Sue was
engaged,'' Love said. ``This guy she later married saw her looking
around and says, `Who're you trying to find?' And Sue says, `You.' ''
</P>
<P>
So the marriage, Sue's third, lasted less than a year. Love's
response: So what?
</P>
<P>
When it comes to finding a life partner, she said, ``the truth of
it is, I think it's kind of a crapshoot anyway.''
</P>
<P>
Because embarking on an impulse marriage is like buying a car
without a road test -- or a warranty -- many couples rapidly end up
visiting the marital equivalent of a mechanic.
</P>
<P>
Omaha psychologist Patricia O'Hanlon Hudson said she despairs when
she sees a couple ``three months after the marriage that took place
two months after they met.'' Yet she called this kind of counseling
``a real opportunity to deal with impulsivity'' -- a trait she equates
largely with immaturity.
</P>
<P>
Instant marriages, concurred Berkeley psychologist Stephen
Goldbart, are often ``the bread-and-butter couple that we see in
therapy. They fall in love, they run off and get married, they run
into trouble.''
</P>
<P>
Couples who fall in love and marry instantaneously often find
themselves ``over-amped,'' said fellow Berkeley psychologist David
Wallin, who, with Goldbart, has written a new book called ``Mapping
the Terrain of the Heart'' (Addison Wesley, 1994).
</P>
<P>
The sex may be stupendous, Wallin said -- a meshing of mutual
fantasies. But instant marriage participants are probably ``merger
hungry,'' he said, meaning that ``they can't bear to be alone.''
Partners who marry quickly also tend to over-idealize, Wallin said,
portraying the new mate as ``a dream come true.'' Few mortals, as it
happens, can measure up to such expectations.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Revenge and rebound are fairly common themes in instant marital
histories, Goldbart said. Then there is the ``Omigod, I'm 45, and I'm
still not married and I have no kids'' script that sends men and women
alike leaping into the next pair of semi-warm arms that wander into
the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
And some people, Goldbart said, are simply ``impulse-ridden,''
devil-may-care in everything they do, marriage included.
</P>
<P>
``These are the kinds of marriages we suspect won't last very
long,'' Goldbart said, because as soon as they polish off the wedding
cake, ``they're off to the next impulse.''
</P>
<P>
But Kate Wachs would hardly have thought of herself as impulsive, a
woman who waited 40 years before pledging her troth and who has made a
comfortable living running the ``Dr. Kate Relationship Center,''
arranging matches and offering ``A-to-Z'' love advice to men and
women.
</P>
<P>
However, she said she would not necessarily use her own experience
as a model.
</P>
<P>
``It's not that a fast marriage can't work,'' Wachs said. ``It's
just that if you're getting together with someone in less than two
months, you could be being persuaded by infatuation.''
</P>
<P>
As for the odds of success, she said, echoing the assessment of
many of her associates: ``It might work, it might not.''

 FAMILY AFFAIRS: Children Need to See Conflicts Properly Resolved 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sweet, sunny, always peaceful -- how we would love that to be our
family.
</P>
<P>
Common sense says it's impossible; conflict is inevitable. No
family or couple can be in harmony at all times. It doesn't make sense
to see conflict in itself as a problem.
</P>
<P>
What counts is how conflict is handled, and to what degree it
pervades family life.
</P>
<P>
In an article in the Journal of Family Psychology, Lisa H. Jaycox
and Rena L. Repetti of the University of Pennsylvania looked at the
way emotion is dealt with in the family, and how that affects
children.
</P>
<P>
``There's been a lot of research on different kinds of conflict,
and it varies a lot from family to family,'' Jaycox said in an
interview. ``It can be just between the parents -- marital conflict
varying all the way from disagreements to violence. It can involve a
parent-child relationship -- there's a lot of research ... that really
points out how it's a two-way street, how a difficult parenting style
can cause behavior problems in a child, but also a difficult child can
interfere with the parent's ability to manage the child. ...
</P>
<P>
``The point we were making in this article is that a lot of times
when research is focusing on one of those relationships, it sort of
ignores the larger climate in the house, and it may actually just be
measuring an effect of that climate. So it's worth looking at the way
emotion is dealt with in the family, the way it's expressed in
general.''
</P>
<P>
The researchers studied 72 fourth- and fifth-graders. The children,
parents and teachers assessed conflict and anger in the home, marital
discord, ``negative emotional tone'' in the parent-child relationship,
and how well-adjusted the children were.
</P>
<P>
They found that child adjustment was more strongly related to
overall family conflict than to parents' having marital problems.
(Marital trouble indisputably can have a powerful effect on the home,
they note, but the results suggest that family norms ``for acceptable
ways of handling anger and conflict may be more significant for child
adjustment than is discord in the parents' marriage.'')
</P>
<P>
When anger is not dealt with effectively, children's reactions vary
 -- some become depressed; some behave poorly either at home or at
school, Jaycox says.
</P>
<P>
``One of the things I think is most interesting is that apparently
the kids are very tuned in to anger and react to it,'' she says. She
cites research that finds strong physiological and behavioral
reactions in preschoolers to witnessing any kind of anger. ``It
doesn't even have to be verbal or violent.''
</P>
<P>
Jaycox says ``there's something to be said for shielding kids from
some of the things parents are going to go through ... but everyone
gets angry. It would actually be very unnatural for kids to grow up
without seeing any of that.
</P>
<P>
There's no one right way to deal with conflict, Jaycox says, but
there are guidelines:
</P>
<P>
-- If you start an argument when the kids are there, try to resolve
it while they're present, too. ``There is some research that points
out that if you also can resolve the dispute in front of the child, it
can teach conflict resolution, and also that anger isn't toxic or
lethal but natural and can be worked through, and people still love
each other when it ends.''
</P>
<P>
-- Avoid explosive anger by dealing with problems before they become
overwhelming. Physical violence is particularly traumatic for
children.
</P>
<P>
-- Avoid blaming or criticizing the other parent when you're in a
dispute, and ``try to characterize things in term of the conflict at
hand'' (as in, ``Dad and I were arguing about how some money was
spent,'' instead of ``Your father spent all our money on something
stupid, and he's always getting us in trouble like that'').

 The Terrorism Connection 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the Cold War, the United States and its allies assessed
every local conflict for its quotient of strategic harm or benefit.
With the Cold War ended, the allies believe that they may allow local
conflict to remain local with relative impunity.
</P>
<P>
The war in the Balkans has been a semi-exception to this rule. The
European powers have not felt that they could safely ignore the
carnage there completely, but they have also not felt that any enemy
could exploit this war to their serious harm. Serb expansionism under
Slobodan Milosevic was, at worst, an ominous precedent.
</P>
<P>
But this calculus may be due for a revision. Though the Bosnian
government has accepted a European proposal for a Bosnian partition,
the separatist Bosnian Serbs have not. The war seems all but certain
to continue, and the U.N. forces may soon be weakened by the reduction
or even elimination of French and British support. If that happens,
the conflict may continue as a Christian-Muslim conflict with outside
support from the more ardent wing of each side's co-religionists. To
oversimplify, Serbs-against-Bosnian-Muslims could become
Cossacks-against-Moujahedeen.
</P>
<P>
At that point, this local conflict would begin to become a grim
imitation of the Cold War proxy conflicts of old. This time it would
be the shadow of terrorism, rather than the shadow of nuclear
conflict, that would lengthen. The Muslim minorities in several
European countries are increasingly aggrieved and militant. The heavy
loss of Muslim life that would result in the short term from a U.N.
default in Bosnia could exacerbate their sense of grievance and foster
the related militancy.
</P>
<P>
The rhetoric heard at the sentencing of the World Trade Center
terrorist bombers should remind us that the United States is not
immune. That crime was utterly savage, and the life sentences that
have now been imposed are fully justified. But a great deal can be
lost in cross-cultural translation, especially in a climate of rising
hostility. That climate will only worsen if the situation in Bosnia
worsens.
</P>
<P>
``We're fighting them there so that we won't have to fight them
here,'' American soldiers said in Korea and Vietnam. In this instance,
ironically, it is refusing to defend Muslims there that may lead in
time to defending against other Muslims here.

 Retreat to Reality with Japan 
 The following editorial appeared in Thursday's Baltimore Sun: 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having pushed their trade dispute to the point of mutual
disadvantage, the United States and Japan are moved bravely ahead
toward the status quo ante -- toward the policy positions of the Bush
era that Candidate Clinton so willingly assailed and President Clinton
so coyly embraces.
</P>
<P>
Make no mistake: Japan is the clear winner in this test of wills,
which is not to say that its weak governments have enhanced the
well-being of their people. Quite the reverse. If the Clinton
administration is to execute this latest flip-flop without excessive
embarrassment, it had better hope Japanese business prevails over
Tokyo's bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
Consider the retreats ordered this week by U.S. Special Trade
Representative Mickey Kantor in order to restart trade negotiations.
He:
</P>
<P>
-- Stated specifically that the U.S. will not seek numerical targets
in measuring commerce with Japan, a position Tokyo insisted upon from
the start.
</P>
<P>
-- Withdrew threats of retaliation if Japan fails to meet U.S.
demands.
</P>
<P>
-- Made it clear the United States will not impose arbitrary
deadlines for ever-elusive agreements.
</P>
<P>
-- Registered no further objections to Japan's refusal to come up
with a tax cut package big enough to boost U.S. export sales.
</P>
<P>
We cite these shifts not to pound the president but to praise him.
Most of his retreats from the excessive foreign policy postures he set
forth while running for the Oval Office have been prudent if not
politically correct. Refusal to commit ground troops to Bosnia,
hesitation to send the Marines into Haiti, reluctance to use trade
sanctions as a club against Chinese human rights violations - all
these reflect good judgment.
</P>
<P>
So if Clinton adjusts Japan trade policy, he will get no complaints
from this corner. We have long been uncomfortable with the
protectionists and managed-trade addicts in the left wing of the
Democratic Party. It has been Kantor's unpleasant task to keep them at
bay while trying to get the Japanese to take market-opening moves that
are really in their own self-interest. He has a long way to go, but at
least he has gotten negotiators back to the table after a bad 100-day
hiatus.
</P>
<P>
The secret is to promote trends, not targets. If more Japanese auto
dealers sell U.S. cars (to cite a Kantor example), or if imports of
key products move steadily upward, this may have to be sufficient if
Japanese policy aims at continued improvement. Trade agreements can
help, but in the long run market forces will prove decisive.
</P>
<P>
Already there are instances of foreign imports selling much cheaper
than their domestic counterparts. Already, more Japanese manufacturers
are outsourcing abroad for parts and commodities that come at bargain
prices. Once these trends are translated into improved Japanese living
standards, the U.S. can rely on new world trade reforms to hasten the
market-opening process. Meanwhile, the United States and Japan should
work hard for mutual advantage rather than mutual disadvantage.

 D-Day Plus 50: A Case for Inclusion 
 The writer, granddaughter of President Dwight Eisenhower, 
 is chairman of the Center for Post-Soviet Studies. She will 
 be traveling to Normandy on D-Day with ABC. 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An officer in Her Majesty's armed forces was recently heard to quip
that the Allies would not have invaded Normandy if they had known how
difficult it would be to commemorate it.
</P>
<P>
Fifty years after the historic invasion of France by the Allied
Expeditionary Forces, a high-visibility program has been planned, but
the scheduled events have caused more than a little consternation.
Germany and Russia are offended that they have been excluded, and
President Clinton, who has no wartime experience, is calling in
consultants to come up with an appropriate theme. Finding the right
message, however, will be much more difficult, since the decision was
made to mark this historic event in the traditional way -- which now
not only seems outdated but wholly inadequate in today's international
environment.
</P>
<P>
The world is a very different place than it was 50 years ago. For a
start, the Germans, the evil-incarnate enemy, are now a united,
democratic country, an important U.S. ally and the linchpin of
stability in Europe. In addition, one of the critical players on the
allied side no longer exists. The Soviet Union, which heroically beat
back Nazi attempts to conquer it, has splintered into a mostly
non-communist multi-country region.
</P>
<P>
Rather than deal with these new complicating factors, the French,
who are the hosts of the D-Day events, adopted a formula that
accomplishes no particular objective. It does not place essential
focus on the veterans, who are bound to be overshadowed by too many
politicians, nor does it give the participating heads of state an
opportunity to draw on D-Day's contemporary meaning.
</P>
<P>
Finding a way to reconcile wartime commemorations when the enemy is
now your ally has been a problem for some time. Ronald Reagan used the
40th anniversary for great rhetorical benefit, but then felt he had to
``make it up'' to the Germans. After D-Day plus 40 (and Bitburg),
Western diplomats apparently promised the Germans they would be
included on the 50th.
</P>
<P>
Of the nine heads of state that the French have invited, (they have
successfully kept their list as secret as Overlord itself), it is
known only that Germany and Russia are not among them.
</P>
<P>
This is unfortunate. If any heads of state were going to
participate in these events, inclusion should have been the order of
the day. The reason for it is simple: Who the protagonists were in
1944 is not nearly as important or relevant as the nature of the
struggle itself. The ``great crusade,'' as Dwight Eisenhower, my
grandfather, called it, was assembled to defeat fascism. This was
successfully done, and Germany went through the painful process of
de-Nazification. Reneging on our earlier promise now implies that we
harbor some belief that the Germans have a kind of ethnic original
sin.
</P>
<P>
The decision to exclude also constitutes the loss of a real
opportunity. Many contemporary Germans regard the Allied victory as
the ``liberation'' of their country from the fascist grip, and they
express gratitude that history turned out as it did. The German
presence on the Normandy beaches for the 50th would have given
legitimacy to that feeling in Germany, and emphasized Bonn's own
commitment to keeping fascism from ever dominating political life
again.
</P>
<P>
It was also wrong not to extend an invitation to the Russians, and
perhaps other countries of the former Soviet Union. Failing to do so
symbolically decouples the Eastern and Western fronts, and ignores the
impact the Soviet effort had on the success of D-Day. Even worse,
failing to invite the former Soviets has given credence to those in
the East who say the West never appreciated their role in defeating
Hitler. Such an omission also deepens the sense of isolation that is
now widely felt all over the region.
</P>
<P>
Although Americans tend to play down the importance of symbolism,
it is a highly potent force in many other countries around the world.
It is intriguing, for instance, that on VE Day plus 10 years, Germany
became a full member of NATO. The dates agreed upon by the United
States and its Allies must have been a clearly calculated effort to
demonstrate Germany's rebirth as a member of the international
community. Why then is it so difficult some 40 years later?
</P>
<P>
As in so many other instances, the world is waiting for U.S.
leadership. We should have insisted on complete inclusion as a
prerequisite for presidential participation. If not, the commemoration
should have remained a veterans' affair.
</P>
<P>
The presence of Germany and Russia would have brought valued
closure to whatever wounds remain. But it would have also underscored
that those allies who fought not only won the war against fascism,
their ultimate sacrifice eventually paved the way for a new Europe of
peaceful democratic countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
THE RETURN OF JAFAR, Not Rated, 1994, 66 minutes, Walt Disney Home
Theatre, closed-captioned, $22.99.
</P>
<P>
This direct-to-video release is an unhappy return on Disney's
wildly successful ``Aladdin'' franchise, one that clearly did not
benefit from the billion-dollar bounty of the original's theatrical,
video and merchandising divisions.
</P>
<P>
In fact, ``Jafar'' is betrayed all 'round by cost-consciousness:
Cobbled together at overseas animation studios that serve Disney's
television needs rather than its theatrical ones, it pales in
comparison to the ``The Lion King,'' Disney's anticipated summer
blockbuster. Blame it on the curse of the sequel, though many of the
character voices are back, including Gilbert Gottfried as the amoral,
troublemaking parrot, Iago.
</P>
<P>
Noticeably absent, however, is Robin Williams as the voice of the
blue, shape-shifting, manic-expressive Genie (Williams was miffed
about Disney's tight purse strings, particularly after his vocal
performance was singled out by every critic as the original's most
inspired touch). Here he's replaced by Dan Castellaneta, whose
attempts at frenetic wit and zen irony fall flat; perhaps Castellaneta
should have stayed in his Homer Simpson voice.
</P>
<P>
The story itself seems slight, focusing on assorted power struggles
and revenge fantasies pitting the evil genie Jafar and his
thief-henchman Abis Mal against Aladdin, Princess Jasmine and the
Sultan of Agrabah. Iago proves the catalyst for ruin and redemption,
and there's a climactic battle between Jafar and everyone else.
Somehow, it feels like a TV show, it plays like a TV show and it looks
like a TV show.

The first solar-powered refrigerated vending cart made its debut
this month in Washington. Even when the outdoor temperature pushes 90
degrees, the four 30-watt solar panels spread out like an umbrella
above the vendor's head will generate enough electricity to maintain
approximately 500 popsicles at near zero degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
Even under overcast skies, the deep cycle-type battery keeps the

eliminating the need to stock the cart with 25 to 30 pounds of dry ice
daily, about $10 worth.

   Editors, Managing editors:

   The following features on the 50th anniversary of the D-Day
invasion of Europe are tentatively scheduled to move before the June 6
anniversary date. In addition, news stories and event-related features
will move as they develop.

   DDAY-INVASION -- A primer on D-day: what happened, who took part,
why it was so important. 2,000 words, by Rick Atkinson (Post) (i).
Advance for Sunday, May 29; expectable late in week of May 23.

   DDAY-RECON -- Dozens of veterans -- American, British, French,

for World War II; chapters dealing with the preparations, the bombing,

Expectable the week of May 30 for immediate use.

   DDAY-REAGAN -- The former president reminisces about the Normany
invasion and about his trip to the D-Day anniversary celebrations 10
years ago. 1,000 words, by Ronald Reagan (Post special) (k). Advance
for Sunday, June 5; expectable week of May 30.

   DDAY-GI -- Soldier Edward Regan stepped off his landing craft and
nearly drowned; as he struggled forward and lay exhausted off the
beach he was immortalized by photographer Robert Capa. 500 words, by

 Jackie Kennedy Onassis: Preserving Lafayette Square (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hardly anyone now remembers that one day Jackie
Kennedy looked out from the safe haven, the elegant plushness of the
White House, and decided she must save Lafayette Square.
</P>
<P>
Even then, Lafayette Park was full -- not only with marble monuments
but also schoolchildren from Iowa, protesters with incomprehensible
signs and fervent causes, tourists with cameras, and people worn out
on the rough stones of the paths of life. Around the square run stood
early 19th-century residences, remnants of the time when this was the
aristocratic place to live.
</P>
<P>
Through several presidents, the need for more executive office
space had threatened the early houses, leading to plans to replace
them with tall office buildings that would cast shadows on the park
and the people. Some might say Jacqueline Kennedy was concerned with
her view from the White House.
</P>
<P>
But a more-generous view holds that having put the White House on
its way to comfort, order and glory, she was ready to spread out. She,
and eventually her husband, agreed to save Lafayette's historic and
architecturally splendid 19th-century residential gems: Decatur House,
Dolley Madison's House, the other Cosmos Club houses, and Blair-Lee
Houses and the Renwick Gallery.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the cause of historic preservation would be given the
imprimatur of presidential influence. All her life, Jacqueline Kennedy
had grown up in and been a guest in historic houses and thus was
respectful of the past.
</P>
<P>
In fact, she was descended from a Frenchman who came over with the
Marquis de Lafayette to fight the cause of the American Revolution. So
she was especially susceptible to David Finley, chairman of the Fine
Arts Commission.
</P>
<P>
William Walton, a painter, writer and close friend of the Kennedys,
said, ``We had all but given up on Lafayette Square, when she told the
president and me, `You can't stop until the bulldozers roll.' She was
a very strong lady. Her connections with the arts were so natural and
not pretentious. We called in John Carl Warnecke, who understood
office space. By making the buildings go back a block, we saved the
historic houses on the square.''
</P>
<P>
Warnecke recently asked his staff to put together documents
pertaining to the saving of the square. One is a March 6, 1962, letter
from Mrs. Kennedy to Bernard L. Boutin, the General Services
administrator. In it, she writes that she is enclosing a letter from
Finley and goes on to say: ``Because of our interest in history and
preservation, it really matters a great deal to the president and to
myself that this is done well; we have received so much mail on this
subject.
</P>
<P>
``Unfortunately, last summer the president okayed some plans for
buildings; he was in a hurry, he doesn't have time to bother himself
with details like this, he trusted the advice of a friend ... and I
really don't think it was the right advice. With all he has to do, at
least I can spare him some minor problems like this. So, I turn to you
for help.''
</P>
<P>
Now, when we walk in Lafayette Square, we should tip a hat to
Jacqueline Kennedy.

 Banding Together With Music in War (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to war we go. The Navy Museum
is humming with the ballads and ditties that American fighting men and
waiting women have sung to deal with the sorrow and separation of war.
</P>
<P>
The show is an assemblage of recordings, battlefield band
memorabilia and sheet music dating from the Civil War to Desert Storm.
Its unintended but inescapable message is that we neither fight 'em
nor write 'em like we used to.
</P>
<P>
Our worst war, the Civil War that killed more Americans than all
those since, produced the best songs, including some that were sung
with equal emotion on both sides of the battle lines and still have
the power to draw cheers and tears.
</P>
<P>
The divided hearts with which in Vietnam we waged our first losing
war are reflected in the little -- and lousy -- music it produced. From
the stirring ``Battle Hymn of the Republic'' to the mawkish ``Ballad
of the Green Berets'' is both a musical and a moral decline.
</P>
<P>
And let us pray history to draw a merciful veil over the cornball
effusions produced by Hank Williams Jr. and others during Desert
Storm. May they go into blessed oblivion with the jingoistic jingles
of the Spanish-American War (``Do We Remember Dewey at Manila? Do We,
Do We, Yer Bet Yer Life We Do!'').
</P>
<P>
Although the aims of this handsomely presented exhibit are
admittedly modest, as is the space allotted to it, visitors may wish
the museum had taken a bigger swing at such a fat pitch. Our martial
music reflects much about the development of our national character,
and that's a subject upon which we cannot reflect too much.
</P>
<P>
-O- 
</P>
<P>
STRIKE UP THE BAND: Sheet Music From the Civil War to Desert Storm,
through Dec. 31 at the Navy Museum (202) 433-4882.

 Jackie's Quiet Companion (NY) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a particularly emotional moment at this week's
funeral Mass for Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis when Maurice Tempelsman
rose to read the poem he had selected. Titled ``Ithaka,'' it spoke of
discovery and of life's journey, and Tempelsman added his own
sorrowful coda about a journey that had been too short. ``So farewell,
farewell,'' he concluded.
</P>
<P>
``Everyone was deeply moved,'' one of the mourners in attendance
said afterward. ``He read as if he'd written the poem himself. It was
so personal, so heartfelt.''
</P>
<P>
For the co-workers, friends and family inside the limestone church,
Tempelsman had become a familiar figure, someone they would expect to
participate in the service, to stand at Onassis' grave site with her
children. But to those who knew him only from magazine photos of
Tempelsman and Onassis strolling through Central Park, the captions
generally identifying him as her ``companion'' or ``friend,'' he was
more enigmatic. It took her death to fully reveal the central role
that the very private Tempelsman -- a man who shared her home, though a
man who remains married to another woman -- had come to play in her
life.
</P>
<P>
They were the same age, 64, though her enduring loveliness and his
stocky plainness made him appear older. They shared many things:
summers on Martha's Vineyard, interests in art and antiquities
(Tempelsman is a collector), fluency in French, an aversion to
publicity. In the public mind, Tempelsman must possess special
qualities to have attracted such a regal and celebrated woman. But his
admirers, who are many, can see the relationship the other way around:
Onassis must have been far more than a famous beauty to have intrigued
such a cultured and scholarly man. ``It shows her seriousness and the
depth of her intellect,'' says Phil Baum, acting head of the American
Jewish Congress, where Tempelsman has been an active trustee.
</P>
<P>
``For those of us who cared about Mrs. Onassis, it was comforting -- 
it was terrific -- to know she was with somebody who was a good,
generous and gentle man,'' says Roger Wilkins, who was an Agency for
International Development administrator during the Kennedy
Administration and has known Tempelsman for years.
</P>
<P>
A Belgian-born Jew, Tempelsman and his family fled Europe in 1940
and came to New York, where his father established a diamond
brokerage. The industry has always been dominated by families, and
Maurice joined his father's firm as a teenager, just as two of his
three children and a son-in-law have joined his.
</P>
<P>
He is chief executive officer of Lazare Kaplan Inc. (1993 gross
sales: $166 million). Headquartered on Fifth Avenue, it is one of the
largest U.S. companies specializing in the import, cutting and sale of
diamonds; its customers include Tiffany and Cartier. Tempelsman is
also the general partner of Leon Tempelsman Son, which has
investments, mining and mineral trading interests around the world,
particularly in central and western Africa.
</P>
<P>
Africa has been an abiding interest; Tempelsman has friendships and
business alliances of 30 years' duration there, glides easily through
its political and economic circles, is a connoisseur of African art.
``He's a player in that scene,'' says Chester Crocker, former
assistant secretary of state for African affairs. Until Wilkins
succeeded him several months ago, Tempelsman served as chairman of the
board of the nonprofit African-American Institute, which fosters
African development and cooperation between Africans and Americans.
</P>
<P>
In terms of wealth, Tempelsman is not in the Aristotle Onassis
league: By Forbes magazine's calculations, his personal worth didn't
reach the $300 million threshold needed to land on the Forbes 400 list
of the richest Americans. He is a prosperous man nonetheless. That was
his 70-foot yacht, the Relemar, berthed at the Vineyard, on which
Jacqueline Onassis hosted the vacationing First Family last summer;
Tempelsman was at the helm.
</P>
<P>
He met Jacqueline Kennedy when she was still a young senator's wife
and he was supporting JFK's presidential aspirations. Tempelsman has
long been generous to Democratic Party candidates, last year
contributing more than $83,000 to the Democratic National Committee,
the Democratic Senatorial and Congressional campaign committees, and
individual campaigns.
</P>
<P>
But it was apparently not until after Aristotle Onassis' death in
1975, with the twice-widowed Jacqueline living in New York, that they
began spending time together. Tempelsman was one of the financial
advisers who helped her multiply the reported $26 million settlement
she received after Aristotle Onassis' death. Published estimates of
Jacqueline Onassis' wealth have varied wildly -- $100 million? $200
million? ``His counsel resulted in increasing her assets
substantially,'' was all a discreet Tempelsman spokesman would say.
</P>
<P>
By the early '80s, though Tempelsman described himself in a Fortune
interview as a family friend, he and Onassis were quietly but
unmistakably a couple, seen at small dinner parties and low-key
cultural events. According to the spokesman, Tempelsman moved into
Onassis' rambling Fifth Avenue apartment overlooking Central Park
about 1988. His wife of more than 40 years, Lily, lives across the
park on the Upper West Side.
</P>
<P>
Yet it was rare to hear or read a word of opprobrium about
Tempelsman and Onassis' relationship, even from New York's cattier
columnists and insatiable tabloids, which never tired of running her
photograph. It was almost as though the press and public had decided
she was entitled to grow old with someone. His acceptance by her
family probably helped quiet criticism; ``John and Caroline have come
to feel quite close to him,'' his spokesman says.
</P>
<P>
``They were a well-matched and distinguished couple,'' says Vivian
Lowery Derryck, president of the African-American Institute. Onassis
occasionally accompanied Tempelsman to small institute dinners with
African leaders. His demeanor toward her was unfailingly
``comfortable, respectful and loving,'' Derryck says. ``And she
respected and admired him and held him in great affection.''
</P>
<P>
As Onassis' illness progressed, Tempelsman was omnipresent,
escorting her home from the hospital, supporting her on her last walks
through the neighborhood, keeping vigil by her bedside with her
children as she died. Friends say they have sent notes of condolence
but have not wished to intrude on his evident grief.
</P>
<P>
Friends and associates portray him as a man of Old World
courtliness, courtesy and erudition. ``You know from what he says, as
well as what he doesn't say, that there's a lively and fertile mind
operating there,'' Crocker says. ``This is a world citizen we're
talking about, at home in almost any culture he finds himself in.''

 Fed Policy Let Banks Bounce Back From Loan Losses (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the Federal Reserve pushed down short-term
interest rates to unusually low levels in 1992 and kept them there
throughout last year, the central bank made no bones about the fact
that one reason it did so was to help a U.S. banking industry that had
been wounded by big losses on loans.
</P>
<P>
Low short-term rates widened the spread between the interest rates
the banks had to pay depositors to get funds and the rates they
charged borrowers. In addition, the low cost of funds enabled the
banks to make money by investing in medium-term securities, such as
two- or three-year Treasury notes, municipal bonds and other items,
that carried higher rates. These opportunities allowed banks to turn
in record profits and largely restore their battered balance sheets
even though the total amount of loans on their books stopped growing.
</P>
<P>
Banks' investments in securities surged while lending to
businesses, to consumers and for real estate stagnated. This switch
reflected both banks' reluctance to lend and businesses' and
consumers' reluctance to borrow.
</P>
<P>
On the lending side, the banks' previous large loan losses had made
them much more wary about extending credit, particularly for real
estate deals. Covering those losses had sharply reduced the amount of
capital many institutions had on hand to stand behind their
operations, in some cases to critically low levels.
</P>
<P>
On the borrowing side, the 1990-91 economic slump greatly reduced
the demand for credit from businesses that were cutting back rather
than expanding.
</P>
<P>
This combination caused total loans and lease financing at banks
not to grow at all for about two years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, however, bank purchases of investment securities rose
significantly as institutions took advantage of the opportunity to use
low-cost money from depositors to buy notes and bonds that paid a
higher return.
</P>
<P>
``Usually in a recession what happens is that banks have very
little demand for loans, so they put their money into securities,''
said Joseph Wahed, chief economist at Wells Fargo Bank in San
Francisco. When the slump ends the process normally reverses itself,
though this time it was very slow in happening.
</P>
<P>
``The volume of loans has been one of the softest part of the
recovery,'' Wahed said. ``On the West Coast it has been zilch,''
though that has begun to change and loan demand elsewhere has turned
up significantly.
</P>
<P>
Securities purchases also were encouraged by a change in bank
regulation. Several years ago regulators substantially increased the
amount of capital a bank must have relative to its portfolio of
securities, loans and leases. Each type of loan and security is
weighted according to its degree of risk, with regular commercial and
industrial loans carrying a 100 percent weight, home mortgages 50
percent and U.S. government securities zero because there is no risk
of default.
</P>
<P>
That means that there is no capital required to stand behind
government securities owned by banks, which makes the cost of funding
the securities ownership effectively lower than that of a commercial
loan. That difference has given the banks an incentive to keep buying
securities, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, there is still a significant spread between the banks'
cost of funds and yields available on notes and bonds that is
encouraging their purchase even though lending activity has picked up.
</P>
<P>
``There is still a lot of money around the system that is not being
used fully,'' Wahed noted. ``Banks have a lot of money with nowhere to
go.''
</P>
<P>
And that is probably one reason that lending has picked up as well.
While banks have been quick to raise their prime lending rates -- it is
up from 6 percent to 7.25 percent this year in line with the Fed's
increase in short-term interest rates -- to maintain the unusually
large gap between their cost of funds and the prime, they have been
trimming the cost of credit in other ways.
</P>
<P>
A report from senior loan officers at banks released by the Fed
this week showed a continued easing of credit terms, including
reduction in the spread between the prime and actual loan rates,
reduced collateralization requirements and higher lines of credit. The
principal reason given for the easier terms, the Fed said, was
increased competition among lenders.
</P>
<P>
However, the terms on commercial real estate lending have been
eased only very slightly. Many metropolitan areas still have gluts of
empty office space, and banks remain wary about making loans secured
by such real estate. The bulk of the increase in real estate lending
shown in the chart has been for single-family home purchases or
refinancings.
</P>
<P>
Altogether, the trends suggest a banking system that is behaving in
more a normal fashion than it has for several years. However, the
continued high level of securities purchases suggests that banks are a
long way from being at the stage of the credit cycle when they begin
to sell the notes and bonds in their investment portfolios to get the
cash to meet strong loan demand.
</P>
<P>
As Wells Fargo's Wahed said, the banks are flush with money, and
that's the key reason that the rates they are paying depositors have
gone up so little despite the rise in short-term money market rates
this year.

 `Flintstones' Succeeds at Being Cartoonish (Hollywood) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
HOLLYWOOD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Welcome to Bedrock, a town proud of being ``First With
Fire.'' The locals eat at Roc Donald's (``Over 18 Dozen Sold''), watch
George Lucas' ``Tar Wars'' at the drive-in, get their gas at the
Chevrock station and their information via the Cave News Network.
</P>
<P>
You were expecting maybe ``Middlemarch''?
</P>
<P>
Whatever else people say about ``The Flintstones,'' no one will
claim that a chance to make a truly great motion picture was frittered
away here. A live-action cartoon in every sense of the word, this
re-creation of the long-running television series about suburban life
in 2,000,000 B.C. has been carefully designed to be as bright and
insubstantial as a child's toy balloon.
</P>
<P>
Like ``The Addams Family'' before it, this is one of those clever,
lively and ultimately wearying pieces of showy Hollywood machinery
where a glut of creativity has gone into the visuals with only scraps
left over for the plot and the dialogue. But then, given its source
material, what more could anyone have expected?
</P>
<P>
Actually, someone must have at least hoped for more, because press
reports indicate that somewhere between 32 and 35 writers (``almost as
many people as signed the Declaration of Independence,'' mocked Daily
Variety) had a hand in the script. It was finally credited to Tom S.
Parker Jim Jennewein and Steven E. de Souza, but any piece of
writing where the most notable words are ``Yabba-Dabba-Doo!'' is not
going to be up for any Writers Guild awards any time soon.
</P>
<P>
That, as anyone who watched the 1960s TV series remembers, is the
war cry of Fred Flintstone (John Goodman), devoted family man,
operator of a Bronto-crane at the Slate Company quarry and mainstay
of the Water Buffaloes bowling team.
</P>
<P>
Though Fred (who both here and in the cartoon strongly resembles
Jackie Gleason in ``The Honeymooners'') likes to say, ``In my cave, I
reign supreme,'' really his wife, Wilma (Elizabeth Perkins), calls the
shots. And best friends and neighbors Betty (Rosie O'Donnell) and
Barney Rubble (Rick Moranis) also have sizable places in his heart.
</P>
<P>
The best thing the film that bears his family name has done is to
whimsically imagine and create a world where everything, up to and
apparently including Fred's head, is made from stone. Production
designer William Sandell, ``Jurassic Park'' special-effects supervisor
Michael Lantieri and the entire production team have done splendid
work in this area, turning Bedrock into a shiny place that always
diverts the eye.
</P>
<P>
Most fun are a host of animatronic beasties designed by Jim
Henson's Creature Shop to do everyday tasks, like a lobster lawn
mower, a woolly mammoth shower and something called a pigasaurus that
replaces the TV series' vulture as a heavy-breathing garbage disposal
unit.
</P>
<P>
If these devices are unexpected, ``The Flintstones'' plot devices
are less so. The main idea, identical to the one that powers ``The
Hudsucker Proxy,'' has Slate Co. evil-doers Cliff Vandercave and
Sharon Stone (Kyle MacLachlan and Halle Berry) searching for ``an
ignorant stooge'' to help them fleece the firm. Fred is obviously
their man. But his bogus elevation to vice president turns him into a
dreadful snob and causes a rift between the Flintstones and the
Rubbles. From such acorns do $45 million films grow.
</P>
<P>
Though ``The Flintstones'' won't disappoint those who've been
looking forward to seeing the venerable cartoon made human, its
pleasures are not substantial or lasting enough to convince those who
lean toward thinking it all sounds rather feeble.
</P>
<P>
Under the direction of Brian Levant, whose most notable previous
credit was ``Beethoven,'' the acting in the movie, from star Goodman
to Elizabeth Taylor's well-publicized cameo, is, not surprisingly,
cartoonish, with svelte and sexy villains Berry and MacLachlan
registering best, as villains often do in animation.
</P>
<P>
And even the gaudy and amusing production design, winning though it
is, can hold one fascinated for only so long. Even at a lean 92
minutes, ``The Flintstones'' (MPAA rating: PG for ``mild innuendoes'')
eventually makes you want to change the channel and see what else is
on.

 Czech Arms Makers Fight to Survive and Age of Peace (Pilsen) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
PILSEN, Czech Republic
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The once prosperous Czech arms industry,
whose technical know-how had made Czechoslovakia the world's
seventh-largest weapons exporter, is struggling to survive in a
post-Cold War market where some of its best potential customers have
been blacklisted by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Pressure from the Clinton administration scotched a $90 million
deal last year in which a newly privatized Czech company would have
sold Iran six Tamara radar systems that the manufacturer claims is
capable of detecting U.S. B-2 ``stealth'' bombers.
</P>
<P>
More recently, Iran showed interest in buying an upgraded version
of the Soviet-designed T-72 tank that a consortium of Czech companies,
the RDP Group, has undertaken to produce. But just last month, sources
said, the Czech Foreign Ministry bowed again to Washington's wishes
and blocked the deal.
</P>
<P>
The Czech government, eager to clean up its old image as a global
merchant of death, has in fact accepted U.S. proscriptions on arms
sales to nations deemed to be supporters of international terrorism.
These include Iran, Iraq, Syria and Libya -- all potentially major
customers of the Czech arms industry.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, the old communist-ruled Czechoslovak federation
exported arms worth up to $1.5 billion annually, much of it to those
same ``terrorist nations'' but also to more benign customers, such as
Egypt and India. Its most infamous export was doubtless the odorless
chemical explosive Semtex, which has been used widely by terrorists to
blow up passenger jets and public buildings.
</P>
<P>
After the fall of communism in 1989, President Vaclav Havel
crusaded for an end to arms exports as a means of cleansing
Czechoslovakia of its ``terrorist'' taint. But such idealism soon gave
way to the economic reality that the country had to export those
products it could best produce -- and that included weapons.
</P>
<P>
Therefore the government now encourages arms exports, but under a
new and tighter export-control law adopted by parliament in February
that requires the case-by-case approval of the ministries of foreign
affairs, defense, trade and the interior.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Western diplomatic sources here say the RDP Group
``bears close watching,'' particularly its chairman, Lubomir Soudek,
who has visited Iran and reportedly tried to sell turbines and other
heavy machinery for a nuclear power plant there.
</P>
<P>
Following the division of Czechoslovakia into separate Czech and
Slovak republics in 1993, the Czech arms industry was largely
privatized and reorganized into a broadly cooperative network.
Forty-one arms-producing firms now work within the RDP Group to
develop a wide range of products for both military and civilian
markets.
</P>
<P>
Soudek, who is also general director of Skoda Pilsen -- once the
biggest foreign arms producer for Nazi Germany -- said in an interview
at the sprawling Skoda complex here that RDP partners are currently
working on 27 projects for the arms market, about half of which he
believes will find a market. He declined to reveal what any of the
projects involve, saying that ``nobody talks about what they want to
sell.''
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he listed a multitude of problems facing the
industry. These include, he said, the loss of close ties to Slovak
steel plants, a shortage of research and development funds from the
government and a heavy dependence on the Czech military's
modernization plans, which may not be determined until 1998. ``The
arms market is so big, but it's very limited for our weapons,'' he
remarked. ``We will never ever again obtain a rank in the top 10
producers.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports say the RDP Group's biggest military project is
the upgraded T-72 tank -- a joint project with its old Slovak partners
 -- which it hopes to sell to NATO countries. But Soudek was not
optimistic about this either, unless the Czech army agrees to buy and
test it first.
</P>
<P>
Probably the most controversial high-tech item on the new Czech
hardware list is the Tamara, a truck-mounted, highly mobile radar
system developed secretly over the past 30 years by the Czechs in
cooperation with the Soviet military. Now in its third generation, the
Tamara is said to be able to pick up any radiation emitted by an
aircraft from a distance of up to 280 miles. Each system sells for
about $15 million.
</P>
<P>
A big advantage of the Tamara is that it is a passive system and
emits no electronic signals; thus, it cannot be easily located, jammed
or targeted, according to Maj. Gen. Oldrich Barak, president of Tesla
Pardubice, manufacturer of the Tamara, and Otto Taborsky, vice
president of Tesla's parent corporation. Barak, an electronics expert
who has been involved in the Tamara project since its inception in the
early 1960s, insisted that the system has the ability to detect the
U.S. B-2 stealth bomber, which was specifically designed to elude
radar. ``It has been tried; it detected the stealth. It's not just
theory,'' Taborsky added.
</P>
<P>
They refused to say where or when this occurred, but they noted
that 50 Tamara systems are in use in former Soviet Bloc nations.
According to local press reports, the U.S. military also has secretly
obtained one.

 OUTTAKES: A Look Inside Hollywood and the Movies 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four of the five winners of an industry-sponsored screenwriting
contest for ethnic minority writers are expected to attend an awards
ceremony Thursday in West Hollywood, Calif.
</P>
<P>
The fifth will be sitting on San Quentin's death row.
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Gay is serving a death sentence at the penitentiary north
of San Francisco for murdering Los Angeles police officer Paul Verna
during a routine traffic stop in 1983.
</P>
<P>
When Gay submitted a script he wrote in prison to the Writers
Workshop for contest consideration, Willard Rodgers, founder and
director of the organization, said that he was surprised at the degree
of humanity in the story. He said that Gay's selection as one of the
five winners in no way meant that the workshop was condoning the
violence of Gay's past.
</P>
<P>
His script, titled ``A Children's Story,'' was picked from among
170 submissions from across the nation. The story deals with nine
children -- all with mental or physical deformities -- who are lost in a
forest when the bus they are riding is involved in an accident and
their leader is mauled by a bear. The kids then have to find their way
back to safety and in the process of helping each other are surprised
at what they can achieve.
</P>
<P>
It's the first time in the five years of the workshop's contest -- 
which is sponsored by Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment, Quincy
Jones Productions, Carsey-Werner Co., Norman Jewison, MCA/Universal,
Dan Petrie Jr., Sony Pictures Entertainment and Oliver Stone -- that
someone in prison has won the award.
</P>
<P>
``It's uplifting and it teaches the value of cooperation among
people,'' Rodgers said. ``There's not one bit of violence in the
script.''
</P>
<P>
Gay's wife, Janice, said it was unlikely that her husband would
want to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
``He doesn't want any publicity,'' she said.

<P>
Ah, to be young, talented and the toast of Hollywood. Mark Steven
Johnson, 28, and Kevin Smith, 23, are both screenwriters who have seen
their first projects become mini-gold mines in town.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Johnson is already writing a sequel to his first script,
``Grumpy Old Men,'' for Warner Bros.; the first film cost about $18
million and brought in nearly $70 million at the box office. He's also
writing a live-action ``Frosty the Snowman'' for Warners, as well as a
comedy for 20th Century Fox about the first major league female
ballplayer called ``Balls.''
</P>
<P>
As for Smith, his ``Clerks'' -- which won both the Prix de la
Jeunesse and the Critics Week prize at Cannes and was well-received at
Sundance -- has already nailed down several future projects, even
though Miramax is not scheduled to release ``Clerks'' until Aug. 19.
</P>
<P>
In fact, ``Clerks,'' a black-and-white slice of life about
convenience store clerks in New Jersey, is already becoming something
of a mini-Jersey trilogy. Smith is writing a Jersey busboys saga
called ``Busing'' for Disney, and a Jersey boys-go-to-the-mall film
for producers Sean Daniel and Jim Jacks at Universal called ``Mall
Rats,'' which Smith will direct. He also is writing ``Dogma,'' about
growing up Catholic -- in New Jersey -- for Miramax.
</P>
<P>
How each lucked into success has the sweet smell of innocence and
naivete. Both pulled their stories from experiences in their
hometowns.
</P>
<P>
For Smith, ``I was working as a store clerk at the Quick Stop
Convenience store in Leonardo (N.J.) and had spent about four months
at the Vancouver Film School. I saw `Slackers' and decided I was going
to take the rest of my tuition and put it into a film.''
</P>
<P>
He convinced the store manager, his boss for three years, to let
him use the store as the setting. And $27,575 later, Smith had a movie
about 12 hours in a convenience store.
</P>
<P>
Smith won't disclose how much he's received for each of his
projects, but Johnson isn't as coy. Johnson says that after the
success of ``Grumpy Old Men,'' he's now averaging between $175,000 to
$350,000 for his scripts, plus another $175,000 to $200,000 if the
films are made. For ``Grumpy II,'' the initial amount jumped to
$450,000 because it's a sequel. He will get another $300,000 if it is
made.
</P>
<P>
Johnson didn't really know anybody in the business to pitch his
script to. In fact, his big connection at the time was his wife's
hospital co-worker, whose cousin used to be an agent. ``How's that for
a connection? I took a chance and called the guy and he got it to
people, who brought it to Warner Bros.,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
``I'm the same guy who came to L.A. and called up one of the
biggest agents here and said, `Hi, I'm Mark Johnson.' I really didn't
know any better at the time. The only reason the agent took my call is
because he thought I was the producer (Mark Johnson, director Barry
Levinson's former partner). I didn't know about the producer, but once
the agent realized it wasn't him, he told me to take a hike,'' says
Johnson. ``See how quickly it can change?''
</P>
<P>
Both young writers chalk their quick success up to luck, hard work
and forever keeping their egos in check. But the producers who are
pursuing their projects say talent has a little bit to do with it.

 Fox in the Children's Coop (NY) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Barney aside, the most startling success story in
children's television in the '90s is the Fox Kids Network. And
Margaret Loesch is the woman who made it happen.
</P>
<P>
In less than four years, the network has gone from nonexistence to
No. 1 with kids in the ratings categories for ages 2 to 11 and 6 to
17, with such ratings successes as ``Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,''
``X-Men'' and ``Batman'' as well as Steven Spielberg's ``Animaniacs''
and ``Tiny Toons.'' And in light of Monday's announcement that Fox is
trading up for affiliates with stronger signals in 12 major markets,
the kids' lineup seems destined to grow even more powerful. With its
signature action programming spread through an after-school schedule
and a 3½-hour Saturday morning block, it's a good bet your kids are
watching Fox at least part of the time.
</P>
<P>
Kids Network President Loesch, not an unambitious sort, would like
to have a Sunday morning block too, but right now she says the
affiliates make too much money from paid religious programming to give
up that time to the network -- and so instead she'll try a syndicated
Sunday morning Fox radio show next fall.
</P>
<P>
Some critics say the kids' programming is the equivalent of Fox's
schlocky nighttime hits, such as ``Melrose Place'' and ``Beverly Hills
90210.'' But that doesn't seem to bother Loesch.
</P>
<P>
She is sitting in a small bar in a midtown hotel, and the
conversation has turned to one of the big influences in her career, a
small mouse with a squeaky voice and big ears.
</P>
<P>
``The Mickey Mouse Club,'' she says, ``made no pretense about being
anything other than entertaining. But I learned a lot of things. ...
There were those little cowboy stories where kids learned to get along
and how to deal with bullies and stories on what I call self-esteem.''
</P>
<P>
However much she was influenced by the tiny rodent, Loesch, 48,
does seem to know what kids will watch. For years she tried to sell
``Power Rangers'' and ``X-Men'' but had no takers until she herself
became a buyer.
</P>
<P>
``Power Rangers,'' which is about a group of teenagers who become
superheroes by summoning the power of the dinosaurs, is not only a hit
on TV, but the toys it spun off were the big sellers last Christmas.
``X-Men,'' in which a group of ``mutant'' foster children vie for
respectability (``the teen experience,'' says Loesch), has become a
cult hit of the older set too; the network has gotten calls from
30-year-old Wall Street bond traders asking when a new ``X-Men'' will
air.
</P>
<P>
Both shows have been criticized in the press for their violent
content, but Loesch says that neither parents nor teachers have
followed suit -- and, she adds, she will take her cues from them.
</P>
<P>
For the fall, Fox will add an educational program for preschoolers.
It's doing it at the urging of the affiliates, who have to prove to a
skeptical Federal Communications Commission that they are fulfilling
the requirements of the Children's Television Act to provide that kind
of programming.
</P>
<P>
The show, ``Fox's Cubhouse,'' will feature a group of characters
introducing and watching three different shows: Mondays and Fridays it
will be ``Jim Henson's Nature Show,'' a Muppet talk show about nature;
Tuesdays and Thursdays will feature ``Johnson and Friends,'' an
Australian television production with big stuffed animals that teaches
the values of socialization; and on Wednesdays the show is ``Rimba's
Island,'' which will use fantasy animals to teach music and movement.
</P>
<P>
She'll also add ``Spiderman'' to the Saturday schedule, a show that
happens to be produced by New World Communications, in which Fox
acquired an interest this week. In addition, next season will see
``The Tick,'' which Loesch describes as ``an animated superhero show
that pokes fun at superhero shows.''
</P>
<P>
While Loesch says she is enthusiastic about the ``Cubhouse''
concept, she's not happy about the Children's Television Act, which
she describes as a ``kind of gun to the head'' -- and quite
unnecessary, she adds. ``I think we were on the road to doing exactly
what they wanted,'' she says, ``but I resent people saying it's only
because of the act'' that certain shows are being scheduled.
</P>
<P>
And besides, she contends, entertainment programs can teach just as
much as so-called educational programming -- though critics of Fox
would hope she's not thinking of ``Power Rangers'' or ``X-Men'' when
she says that.
</P>
<P>
Some are not so thrilled. Peggy Charren, founder of Action for
Children's Television and a longtime observer of children's
programming, is particularly dismayed by Fox's success. ``The worst
shows are winning the ratings game,'' she says. `` `X-Men' has
absolutely nothing to recommend it. ... It equates foster children
with alien life. What kind of peculiar idea is that?''
</P>
<P>
To help the network understand the effects its programming will
have on children, Fox has set up a six-member advisory board made up
of child-development specialists who deal with children every day. The
board reads scripts and makes suggestions for changes. And according
to board member Frank Palumbo, a Washington pediatrician, the group
has expressed concerns about the violence in both ``Power Rangers''
and ``X-Men.'' He says he believes the network is serious about
responding to that issue.
</P>
<P>
Loesch says her standard rule is that violence should not be of the
sort that could be imitated by a child to his harm. But then she tells
you she saw her own 5-year-old son imitate the karate on ``Power
Rangers'' and had to intervene to get him to stop. ``The minute he
jumped up and started pretending he was a karate expert, I said, `You
can pretend to be playing karate, but you don't go out and chop the
cat and you can't hit your friends, that's unacceptable. This is a
fantasy and it's only television.' And he understood.''

On any night of the week, you can drive to a little
building in the west end of town here, lay down $9, climb aboard an
alien spacecraft and shoot a lot of people with a laser gun.
</P>
<P>
That's entertainment, according to four entrepreneurs who believe
they have opened the latest in high-tech amusements here and plan to
take their venture to the Washington suburbs soon.
</P>
<P>
It's 21st century paint-ball without the paint (or the bruises).
It's like being inside a video game, but more real, especially when
you watch another player smile as he ``stuns'' you and walks calmly
away. Afterward, everyone gathers around a video screen, dripping
sweat, and waits for their scores to appear. It's called Ultrazone,
and just weeks after opening here it's packing in teenagers and people
in their 20s, who come for the adrenaline rush and the chance to feel
like characters in an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, stalking each other
down passageways of a space ship. Despite the violent premise, it's
all supposed to be clean fun: Alcohol and drugs are verboten, as is
running, and no one actually dies -- they just rack up really low
scores and get to play again.
</P>
<P>
The game even has developed a small corporate following. Friday
afternoon, for example, several white-collar workers from Reynolds
Metals Co. down the road were chasing each other around inside the
6,000-square foot building that used to house a window and door store.
</P>
<P>
The concept was born about a decade ago in Australia, when a few
computer engineers designed a complex game of tag in which players
wear vests equipped with light sensors. Fire a laser at the right spot
on an opponent's vest, incapacitate him and score points.
</P>
<P>
That may sound simple, but throw in a story involving a battle for
control of the ship, complete with theatrical fog, pounding metallic
music, sirens and general mayhem, and you have an intense 15-minute
experience.
</P>
<P>
The game has spread to England, Canada, a few other U.S. and Japan,
and is soon to arrive in South America. Troy Peple, president of the
company that bought the Virginia franchise from the Australian
company, said this kind of entertainment will be all over the United
States in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
``In three to five years, they'll be everywhere,'' he predicted,
standing in the lobby of his first and only center. Nearby young
enthusiasts queued up for tickets and plugged ``ROM buttons'' they
carry on key chains into a terminal that instantly calls up their
career records as Ultrazone players.
</P>
<P>
The experienced players adopt pseudonyms like Troll, Spawn and
Blood Glitter. But even novices get into the spirit quickly. Kim
Abbott, a 17-year-old from nearby Chesterfield, said after playing her
third game: ``You get a big rush, because you feel like you actually
killed people.''
</P>
<P>
Bud Whitehouse, who visited Ultrazone on Friday evening with his
son and daughter, said he wasn't worried about the violent tone.
``It's been a long time since I played cowboys and indians, but I can
remember playing it at the same level of aggression,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Cassius, a Memphis psychologist who has studied high-tech
games and how they affect people, said games such as Ultrazone affect
individuals differently. ``It can create a numbing effect, from a
negative standpoint, if the game is a game that emphasizes aggression.
On the other hand, it can allow some expression (of aggressive
impulses) in a socially acceptable manner.''
</P>
<P>
Peple, a certified public accountant with a background in
commercial real estate, said he and three business associates in their
thirties and forties pooled $500,000 to open the Richmond center. They
are about to close on a site in Virginia Beach, are negotiating on
locations in Northern Virginia and are trying to obtain the Maryland
franchise rights, he said.
</P>
<P>
Peple would not provide specific revenue or profit figures, but
said more than 10,000 games have been played since the site opened in
early April. The price is $5 or $7, depending on time of day, plus a
$2 membership fee.
</P>
<P>
Peple and his partners are not the only ones seeking to cash in on
the Nintendo generation's appetite for high-tech entertainment, but it
remains to be seen how much staying power such ventures will have. He
takes pains to distinguish Ultrazone from an early '80s game called
Photon, also a form of light-based tag, which achieved fad status in
some cities before vanishing.
</P>
<P>
``There's no doubt that this is a very hot segment of the market
today, the laser-tag business,'' said John Latta, president of 4th
Wave, an Alexandria, Va., consulting firm that follows high-tech
entertainment.

 Sony: Alive With the Sight of Music 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A half century ago, when he was the music critic for the New York
Herald Tribune, Virgil Thomson used to write about going to ``hear''
an opera. Today, in contrast, music lovers are more likely to talk
about going to ``see'' Itzhak Perlman play the violin or Mstislav
Rostropovich conduct the National Symphony. The difference points up a
profound change in the way people think about music: It is now
considered a largely visual experience, thanks to the pervasive
influence of television.
</P>
<P>
So it was probably a smart move last year when Peter Gelb was
appointed president of both Sony Classical USA, which produces audio
recordings, and the international Sony Classical Film and Video, which
produces both theatrical films and home videos. As a TV producer, Gelb
won half a dozen Emmys, for Metropolitan Opera telecasts he produced
and for music documentaries made by CAMI Video, which he founded and
which is now part of Sony.
</P>
<P>
During his short time at Sony, Gelb has brought out some of the
best items available on the classical home video market. Those
released only on video include ``Vladimir Horowitz: A Reminiscence''
(laser disc SLV 53478; also on VHS), part of which was shown recently
on PBS, and Herbert von Karajan's sumptuous 1984 Salzburg production
of ``Der Rosenkavalier'' (S2LV 48313, two laser discs, also on VHS),
which appeals to the eye as much as the ear-and very strongly to both.
Others can also be heard on audio CDs, including ``Dvorak in Prague: A
Celebration'' (laser disc SLV 53488; compact disc SK 46687) and ``John
Williams: The Seville Concert'' (Laser Disc SLV 53475; compact disc SK
53359).
</P>
<P>
All four of these home videos have one thing in common: They
originated as television programs. Gelb insists that even the giant
Sony Corp. could not have produced them without one or more television
networks sharing the costs. ``The classical home video market is not
sufficient to pay for such productions,'' he says. ``We need broadcast
partners, and the television link will have to continue for the
foreseeable future; it's a major source of financial support.'' The
cost of producing a video recording can be 10 times as high as for
audio only, according to Gelb, and the result is that ``for every show
I get to do, there are 20 or 30 that are considered but not
realized.''
</P>
<P>
There is no question that video can give a strong added dimension
to recorded music. ``The Seville Concert'' was videotaped on location
in an ancient Spanish castle, with a different visual background for
each number, carefully and sometimes brilliantly selected to reinforce
the music's effect. ``Dvorak in Prague'' relies not on scenic
background but on the performers' personalities to enhance the video
dimension -- and since the soloists include Perlman, Yo-Yo Ma and
Frederica von Stade, this strategy works well. Watching Ma and Perlman
play an arrangement of Dvorak's ``Humoresque'' intensifies the musical
experience. It is wonderful just to hear von Stade sing the lovely
``Song to the Moon'' from ``Rusalka'' on the CD, but it is even more
satisfying to see her sing it.
</P>
<P>
The case is different for a documentary like ``Vladimir Horowitz: A
Reminiscence,'' which was made for television. It works only in a
video format and enjoys the promotional advantage of having been shown
nationwide on PBS. Laser video discs, unlike CDs, can be recorded and
played back on both sides, allowing up to two hours of material on a
single disc. Gelb takes advantage of this capacity to give home video
viewers a substantial plus that was not seen on PBS: a superbly played
Horowitz recital in London.
</P>
<P>
Though ``Der Rosenkavalier,'' stylishly conducted by von Karajan
and beautifully sung, could be enjoyed in an audio recording, a lot
would be missed. The performers, including Anna Tomowa-Sintow, Kurt
Moll, Agnes Baltsa and Janet Perry, have acting skills that deserve to
be seen, and the Salzburg Festival's sets and costumes reinforce the
music of Richard Strauss in establishing this opera's unique
atmosphere, a substantial part of its charm.

 Germany's Maze of Business Regulation Challenges U.S. Firms 
 (Berlin) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the big American law firm of Mayer, Brown Platt
decided to trumpet the opening of a new Berlin branch office this
spring, it did what big American law firms often do to win friends and
influence people: It planned a big party.
</P>
<P>
And what a party. Embossed invitations were sent to hundreds of
guests across Germany and around the world. The mayor of Berlin, the
U.S. ambassador and the German economics minister all agreed to make
welcoming speeches. Chicago-based Mayer, Brown even booked the
Landesgericht, Berlin's state courthouse, for the occasion.
</P>
<P>
Every detail was considered and reconsidered -- except, alas, the
sensitivities of local attorneys. Roused by outraged German lawyers,
the Berlin bar swung into action, obtaining a court injunction
blocking the party on grounds that it violated stringent rules
prohibiting law firms from soliciting clients. Less than a week before
the scheduled March 1 bash, Mayer, Brown was forced to cancel and
uninvite some 600 guests.
</P>
<P>
``We certainly didn't want to stick a finger in the eye of local
lawyers,'' said C. Mark Nicolaides, the firm's managing partner here.
``We had no idea it would cause that sort of reaction.''
</P>
<P>
In its own small, humbling fashion, the episode illustrates the
challenges and occasional perils U.S. firms encounter when they try to
do business in a country where custom, regulation and social nuance
can create many a sticky wicket.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 1,250 U.S. companies operate in Germany. Many of them
 -- Ford Motor Co., General Motors Corp., Coca-Cola Co. -- have been here
for decades and have successfully become part of the landscape. But
for newcomers trying to tap newly opened markets in the east, it
doesn't take long to discover that when working here there is a right
way, a wrong way -- and a German way. ``The cultural and bureaucratic
barriers can be substantial,'' said Donald Kobletz, formerly the State
Department's senior lawyer in Berlin and now a private attorney here.
``In the States, there's bureaucracy but it operates basically under a
principle of benign neglect. The Germans don't believe in benign
neglect -- they believe in benign harassment. I think it has something
to do with the German need for security: You surround yourself with
rules and regulations.''
</P>
<P>
Especially troublesome for business executives is a sclerotic
system for getting new enterprises approved. ``To get a building
permit for a major chemical plant in Germany now takes an average of
70 months; in neighboring Belgium it takes 12 months,'' said Kurt
Kasch, senior vice president of the Deutsche Bank office in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
There are no precise estimates on how many U.S. firms have
abandoned Germany and gone elsewhere with their investment dollars,
although figures from the American Chamber of Commerce in Germany
indicate U.S. investment has been flat since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
For those who have plunged into the brave new world of former East
Germany, the experience often has been bittersweet. In early 1993, for
example, Kaneb Services Inc., of Richardson, Tex., paid Treuhand, the
government agency set up to privatize or liquidate former East German
companies, $610,000 for an East Berlin engineering firm called
Kraftwerks und Lagenbau. After a year of wrangling with Treuhand over
how to restructure the company ``to make it a profitable and viable
business,'' Kaneb pulled out, according to Kaneb Vice President Howard
Wadsworth.
</P>
<P>
Kaneb has nine other operations in eastern Germany, most involving
maintenance services for industrial facilities. ``Our general
experience has been very good,'' Wadsworth said. ``And then, like this
last case, there've been some difficult ones.''
</P>
<P>
``Difficult'' is a word Raymond Learsy uses often in describing his
efforts to revive Berlin Kosmetik, a former East German cosmetics firm
he paid $24 million to take over last year. Once a thriving
manufacturer of shampoos, lipsticks, skin care products and the like,
the company's sales had fallen from $60 million a year before East
Germany's collapse to $4 million in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Learsy said he has difficulty getting shelf space in western
Germany, a symptom of what Andrew Luedders, an American Chamber
official in Frankfurt, calls ``the rather well-defined, or
constricted, relationships in Germany between producers and
distributors and retailers.''
</P>
<P>
``It appeared to be a level playing field, but it's really weighted
toward the status quo,'' Learsy said. For example, shop hours are
severely restricted by law in Germany, with few stores open evenings,
Saturday afternoons or Sundays. ``The shortened shopping hours
necessitate brand identification buying because people don't really
have time to browse,'' Learsy said. ``That protects established
brands.''
</P>
<P>
Mayer, Brown's problems were of a different nature. One of the 10
largest U.S. law firms, with 600 attorneys and nine offices worldwide,
the firm decided to open a branch in Berlin because Frankfurt and
Duesseldorf appeared ``overlawyered,'' said managing partner
Nicolaides. Loosely affiliated with a large German law firm, Mayer,
Brown envisioned Berlin as a springboard for dealmaking and legal work
throughout Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
``We're not coming in saying we're going to take business away from
German lawyers,'' Nicolaides said. ``We don't compete against them -- 
we don't want to; we don't need to.''
</P>
<P>
``We wouldn't have objected if they hadn't chosen that particular
place (for the reception) and invited so many prominent people,'' said
Bernhard Dombeck, president of the Berlin bar. ``That was a little too
showy.''
</P>
<P>
As for others looking to crack the German market, Robert F. Smith,
the American Chamber representative in Berlin, observed: ``Doing
business in Germany is not that difficult. But you have to follow the
rules.''

 Big-Screen `Flintstones' Fails to Improve on Original Material 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As funny as it was, ``The Honeymooners'' was basically a one-joke
show: Ralph Kramden, '50s Brooklyn caveman, can't get a break. Its
Hanna-Barbera alter ego, ``The Flintstones,'' which came along in
1960, was a one-joke show, too: same caveman, flashed back to the
Stone Age.
</P>
<P>
The solitary gag that propels the big-budget feature film version
of ``The Flintstones'' is the translation of cartoon humor into
live-action: The mastodon as kitchen faucet (and Greek chorus); the
large-beaked bird as Victrola; the giant crab as pin-changer at the
Bowl-o-Rama, and Fred, as embodied by the lovably cartoonish John
Goodman, suspended in midair during an ecstatic yabba-dabba-doo.
</P>
<P>
Directed by Brian (``Beethoven'') Levant and produced by Stephen
Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment (yes, there's a ``Jurassic Park''
plug in here, too), ``The Flintstones'' makes relentless puns on the
words ``rock'' and ``stone,'' offers proof that product placement
knows no particular millennium (Cavern on the Green, RocDonald's,
Rolling Rock beer) and gets mileage out of gags that were old when
Dino was a pup. The intro, the music, the finale, they're all straight
out of the original Bedrock. In other words, if you loved the cartoon
show, you'll probably love the movie.
</P>
<P>
And did we love the cartoon? As Fred might say, ``Is the Earth
flat?''
</P>
<P>
The TV ``Flintstones'' was never that funny, perhaps because it
didn't have a Gleason. The ``Flintstones'' movie doesn't have one
either, but it has Goodman, who plays the anti-Kramden on ``Roseanne''
and has done some memorable work in the Coen brothers' movies. No
one's ever been more physically right for a role than Goodman is for
longtime Slate Co. brontosaurus-operator Fred Flintstone, and he's a
lot more Ralphy boy than Fred, but he remains throughout the movie an
oddly unengaging presence; rather than flesh out the cartoon, Goodman
is sucked into the animation vortex.
</P>
<P>
So is the rest of the cast. As Fred's little buddy, Barney Rubble,
Rick Moranis creates a more original character, but he's mugging, too.
Elizabeth Perkins as Wilma and Rosie O'Donnell as Betty have the right
giggle, Perkins certainly has the right look, but the actors seem to
be striving toward a Saturday morning-style one-dimensionality that's
epitomized by Elizabeth Taylor's hammy cameo as Fred's mother-in-law,
Pearl Slaghoople.
</P>
<P>
Although nearly devoid of what's usually defined as wit, ``The
Flintstones,'' will probably amuse both young children and older set
designers. The town of Bedrock may look parched and inhospitable, but
it contains a lot of ingenious sight gags, as well as gaps in logic:
They have television, for instance (on which Jay Leno hosts
``Bedrock's Most Wanted'') but they still write with hammers and
chisels. In any event, the animals -- which are the products of either
Jim Henson's Creature Shop in London, or Industrial Light and Magic in
California -- are engaging, more so than the actors. Certainly, the
pigasaurus garbage disposal has personality, and the Dictabird (voice
of Harvey Korman) has as pivotal a role in the story as any human.
</P>
<P>
It's the Dictabird who gets Fred out of the jam he finds himself in
 -- his own bombast, as usual, being partly the cause -- after the
nefarious Cliff Vandercave (Kyle MacLachlan) promotes him to vice
president at Slate Co. Cliff, a Stone Age yuppie embezzler and one
of the two more interesting characters in the film -- the other being
Fred's secretary, Sharon Stone, played by the scene-stealing Halle
Berry -- needs a dupe to perpetrate the liquidation of Slate Co. So
he invites all employees to take an aptitude test, which Barney aces,
and Fred fails. But Barney owes Fred big -- Fred having lent Barney
money so the Rubbles could adopt Bamm-Bamm (twins Hlynur and Marino
Sigurdsson). (It was easier on the cartoon, if you recall, when
Bamm-Bamm was left on the doorstep.) So Barney switches their papers.
Fred gets the job and becomes insufferable. Barney, with the lowest
score, is fired. Friendship, of course, will triumph, as will Fred.
</P>
<P>
You may ask yourself: If Cliff needs a stooge to take the rap for
his insidious scheme, why give the job to the highest-scoring
applicant? But the script by Tom S. Parker, Jim Jennewein and Stephen
E. de Souza makes no pretense of intelligence. Basically, ``The
Flintstones'' simply wants to plagiarize itself, and the only thing
missing is the laugh track.
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, ``The Flintstones,'' like many cartoons these days, is
little more than a marketing tool. That the movie is as insubstantial
and vacuous as the products it's designed to sell is appropriate: Why
else would it have been made? There's certainly no broadening of the
original material, no irony, no reflection. Eventually, the people who
make these things will realize that there's really no need for a movie
at all, just an advertising campaign, the right poster-friendly image
(in this case, Goodman/Fred) and tie-ins with companies like
McDonald's. A lot of money will be saved, a lot of eye-strain avoided.
</P>
<P>
Two stars; add a star if you're under 9.

 `Improper Conduct' Deftly Spins Psychological Thriller (Hollywood) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
HOLLYWOOD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
``Improper Conduct'' is a nifty modest-budget
psychological thriller pegged to the timely issue of sexual
harassment. It is the 15th film by the enterprising Dr. Jag Mundhra,
who has been a professor of marketing, advertising and consumer
behavior and who once operated a theater in Southern California that
showcased Indian cinema.
</P>
<P>
``Improper Conduct'' is the first of Mundhra's films to be released
theatrically, his previous efforts having been contracted to go
straight to video. This movie is the confident work of an efficient
filmmaker who knows the ropes.
</P>
<P>
In a sharp ensemble cast, Tahnee Welch plays a beautiful commercial
artist newly hired by a Los Angeles advertising agency, where owner
Stuart Whitman has just appointed son-in-law John Laughlin as head of
marketing. Laughlin immediately starts hitting upon Welch with
increasing persistence and menacing crudeness, refusing to take no for
an answer. Welch's visiting sister, Lee Anne Beaman, a feminist law
student, persuades her to hire Beaman's lawyer friend Steven Bauer to
file suit against Laughlin. Bauer feels sure that his brisk assistant
Nia Peeples won't have any trouble lining up other women Laughlin has
pestered; besides, Welch has one witness, the office's mail-room
worker (Everette Lamar), a gutsy young gay man.
</P>
<P>
Up to this point ``Improper Conduct'' plays like a crisp, decently
made TV movie, whereupon it veers unexpectedly and effectively in an
entirely different direction. Having pointed up the pitfalls of women
trying to fight back against sexual harassment, Mundhra and writer
Carl Austin deftly move the film from courtroom drama to erotic
suspense.
</P>
<P>
Technically adroit, ``Improper Conduct'' (MPAA rating: Unrated) is
notable for its array of well-defined, well-acted roles. The cast
includes Adrian Zmed, as a slimy kiss-and-tell type; Kathy Shower as
Laughlin's fluffy, naive wife; and Patsy Pease, as a Welch co-worker
not above using sex to get ahead. Laughlin is properly repellent and
scary; Welch, who recalls the early Rita Hayworth as much as she does
her mother, Raquel, is persuasively vulnerable yet determined; but
it's Beaman, who has worked previously for Mundhra, who is the film's
revelation as the deceptively demure sister.

 Beth B.'s `Small Bodies' a Captivating, Complex Work (Hollywood) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
HOLLYWOOD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
``Two Small Bodies,'' a thoroughly captivating film
adaptation of Neal Bell's play, seemingly is simplicity itself.
</P>
<P>
A trench-coated police detective (Fred Ward) comes to a suburban
house to interrogate a single mother (Suzy Amis) on the disappearance
of her two young children. Very early on it's clear that Ward's Lt.
Brann believes that Amis' Eileen Maloney, estranged from her husband,
has murdered her kids -- and that Brann, who speaks only with love of
his own two children, will quickly become obsessed with the case.
</P>
<P>
``Two Small Bodies'' (MPAA rating: unrated) allows its stars to
shine in far-ranging, deeply probing characterizations of the kind
that actors all too rarely get to play on the screen, even those as
talented as Ward and Amis.
</P>
<P>
Brann and Maloney's ensuing battle of wits yields an amazing
thicket of thoughts, emotions and evolving perceptions, and they have
been elucidated with an unsettling thoroughness by the veteran
independent filmmaker known as Beth B. Indeed, Beth B., who
collaborated on the screenplay with Bell as well as directed the film,
is ideal for this assignment. Such earlier films as ``Vortex'' (1983)
and ``Black Box'' (1978), made with her husband, Scott B., have been
concerned with the abuse of power, both political and sexual.
</P>
<P>
Worn and pale when we first meet her, Eileen, a strip joint
hostess, reminds us of Meryl Streep's mother of a missing child in
Fred Schepisi's ``A Cry in the Dark'' in that she seems simply weary
rather than heartbroken or distraught, which is how mothers are
supposed to act in such circumstances. (It is possible, after all, for
a mother to be a grudging, reluctant parent without being a child
killer.)
</P>
<P>
Right off her aura of cool resignation throws Brann, a sexy
ultra-macho type with a traditional view of women's roles as a wife
and mother. His relationship with Eileen teeters like a seesaw, as the
impact of his menace wavers as Eileen appears to gather strength,
acquiring an increasingly blunt, hard edge, seeming to agree with much
of what he has to say about her.
</P>
<P>
Through this endless parrying much emerges. First, we find
ourselves not quite so quick to believe that Eileen may in fact be
guilty of infanticide, and then we start wondering about Lt. Brann.
How do we know he really is a cop? Could he be the killer of the
children himself -- if they are in fact dead?
</P>
<P>
Suspense, in turn, triggers paradox: Could a man as sexually
dominant as Brann, a man who sees himself as a good guy, be finding
himself tantalized by the prospect of yielding to what he sees as the
embodiment of evil? And then there is the role of illusion, seemingly
so much more crucial to men than to women, who constantly find
themselves in situations where they feel that they must pretend to be
other than what they are to men, many of whom even today still see
women as either madonnas or whores. Illusion, in fact, battles with
truth throughout ``Two Small Bodies,'' which is so compelling that it
never once seems a filmed play.

 RECORD RACK: Capsule Reviews of Recent Releases 
 Album scale: one star (poor) to four (excellent). 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beastie Boys ``Ill Communication'' (Capitol) 3½ stars. Other
rappers used to fault the Beasties for their abrasive, somewhat
monochromatic rapping style, and on ``Ill Communication,'' the boys
have largely returned to the one-note bray they made famous on their
1986 album, ``Licensed to Ill.''
</P>
<P>
With this album, as on 1989's ``Paul's Boutique,'' they are masters
of the fun part of hip-hop that many artists have forgotten -- the art
of swiping bits of music from hundreds of obscure old records and
stitching them together into something resembling art. They even
manage to manufacture a beat around a second or two of low groans from
singing Tibetan monks.

Once again, the Beasties prove they are maybe the 417th best
hard-core punk band in the world, and again, they fill out the album
with dusted, low-tech instrumentals.
</P>
<P>
But the Beasties are a lot more ambitious than they'd like you to
think they are. The complete, self-referential trash-culture world
they create on ``Ill Communication'' may be on a level with the
visions of prime Public Enemy and Nine Inch Nails. -- JONATHAN GOLD

<P>
Nick Cave the Bad Seeds ``Let Love In'' (Mute/Elektra) 3½
stars. Will this explorer of the soul's darkest recesses be the
upcoming ``Lollapalooza'' tour's sacrificial cult band, like the Jesus
and Mary Chain two years ago -- a nocturnal creature brought blinking
to the stage in bright sunlight while the alternative-rock hit acts
wait for the flattering cover of night?
</P>
<P>
Even though it coincides with this opportunity to be heard by a
huge audience -- one that has embraced his filtered-down influence
without even knowing it -- Cave's new album isn't exactly a gesture
toward the mainstream. But ``Let Love In'' is less phantasmagoric than
its immediate predecessors, abandoning the last album's queasy cabaret
and surreal sea chanteys for classic rock strains -- a ``Blonde on
Blonde'' richness, haunting Doors grooves, Stones raucousness.
</P>
<P>
Musical broadening notwithstanding, ``Let Love In'' is unmistakably
Cave. Devils still crawl around the bedroom, cities are dark and
murderous places, and love remains a source of loss and torment and
little else. Cave has never set forth these themes with more musical
elegance, and he illuminates them with something new -- the glimmerings
of a vulnerable spirit. -- RICHARD CROMELIN

<P>
All-4-One, ``All-4-One,'' (Blitzz/Atlantic) 3 stars. Tired of all
the wanna-be vocal groups desecrating doo-wop? Then check out
All-4-One's debut album. In modern-day doo-wop, this is as good as it
gets. The young group's reverence for vintage doo-wop is evident on
such romantic songs as the glorious remake of ``So Much in Love,'' a
highlight of this excellent album -- mostly ballads -- boasting
spine-tingling harmonies. -- DENNIS HUNT

 Philippine Military Captures Most-Wanted Rebel (Manila) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MANILA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Philippine military Thursday captured the country's
most-wanted communist rebel, the mastermind of an urban hit squad that
has been blamed for the killings of a U.S. Army colonel and more than
200 policemen and local officials.
</P>
<P>
The arrest of Felimon Lagman, 43, appeared to deal a serious blow
to a 26-year-old communist insurgency that has been wracked by bitter
infighting, ideological rifts and the repudiation of its guiding
principles in much of the world.
</P>
<P>
Lagman was arrested Thursday morning by naval intelligence agents
as he drove a car in the Quezon City district of this sprawling
capital of more than 8 million people. A 24-year veteran of the
rebellion and the younger brother of a congressman, he headed the
5,000-member underground Communist Party apparatus in Manila, which
fields a feared assassination squad called the Alex Boncayao Brigade.
</P>
<P>
``It's a very big loss for the (brigade), as well as ... the entire
Communist Party of the Philippines,'' said President Fidel Ramos. But
he said the dwindling guerrilla movement would continue to pose a
threat of urban killings, and a senior government official said
authorities were bracing for a possible ``terrorism campaign'' in
retaliation.
</P>
<P>
The Alex Boncayao Brigade, named for a leftist labor leader who
joined the guerrillas and was slain by security forces in 1983, went
on a rampage of urban killings here in the late 1980s. Among its
victims was Col. James Rowe, an American military adviser who was
gunned down in a street ambush in April 1989 as he was being driven to
work in his supposedly bulletproof car.
</P>
<P>
The killings of local police and others proved unpopular, and the
brigade was reined in when it earned a reputation as a communist death
squad. Lately, however, it has shown a resurgence of activity.
</P>
<P>
The group, which is believed to include about 30 trained assassins
and about 100 other members in the capital, claimed responsibility for
the May 7 assassination of Timoteo Zarcal, a former police colonel who
was recently acquitted of kidnapping charges. Last month, it admitted
gunning down the father of a suspect on trial in a rape-murder case,
charging that the father had participated in the crime.
</P>
<P>
The brigade has also put out lists of allegedly corrupt legislators
and government officials, but Lagman denied that they were being
``targeted for liquidation.''
</P>
<P>
The arrest of Lagman came two days after 11 sympathizers of the
brigade were detained for participating in an unauthorized street
demonstration to mark the 10th anniversary of its founding. The
brigade used the occasion to announce a new policy, saying it would no
longer impose ``revolutionary taxes'' in the capital region and that
summary execution would no longer be its only method of implementing
``revolutionary justice.''
</P>
<P>
On May 4, the Ramos government scored a coup by arresting Wilma
Tiamzon, 42, the secretary general of the Communist Party and a key
supporter of party founder and chairman Jose Maria Sison, who lives in
self-exile in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
After it was founded in December 1968, the Communist Party formed
an armed wing, the New People's Army, to wage a Maoist-inspired
``protracted people's war'' aimed at overthrowing the government. Tens
of thousands of Filipinos were killed over the next 20 years as the
fighting spread and the guerrilla army grew to an estimated 26,000
fighters. Since then, however, the collapse of communism in Eastern
Europe, internal party splits and the restoration of democracy in the
Philippines have eroded the movement, which now fields about 8,000
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
A major rift developed in 1992, pitting Sison and a coterie of
loyalists including Tiamzon against renegades led by Lagman and
several other senior party officials and guerrilla commanders. A
formerly cohesive, committed revolutionary movement has turned into a
collection of malcontents whose feuding sometimes takes on a
soap-opera quality.
</P>
<P>
Lagman has denounced Sison as a ``degenerate communist and
unremolded misfit,'' while the Sison camp has accused Lagman and his
comrades of offenses ranging from ``gangsterism'' to ``sexual and
financial opportunism.''
</P>
<P>
In January, a former guerrilla commander linked to opponents of
Sison was executed gangland-style by unidentified gunmen outside his
house near Manila. Last month, Sison's faction said it had gunned down
another former rebel, Leopoldo Mabilangan, 34, for alleged criminal
activities.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lagman and Sison have traded threats and
recriminations, with each claiming that the other is trying to
assassinate him.
</P>
<P>
``Come and get me,'' Lagman said earlier this month in response to
an arrest order against him from the Sison camp. He warned that if
Sison's followers tried to capture or execute him, ``automatically we
will hit Sison in Utrecht,'' the Dutch city where the party founder
maintains his headquarters. ``Sison's death,'' Lagman said, ``would be
just a phone call away.''
</P>
<P>
``I now laugh it off,'' Sison said of the threat, adding that he
had already taken ``precautionary measures.''

 Federal Retirees Await Settlement of Va. Case (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal and military retirees racing to beat a phantom
deadline for qualifying for their share of a potential $700 million
tax refund from the State of Virginia can relax. The refund issue
remains unsettled, but Virginia tax officials have begged us to tell
you there is no deadline for filing amended tax returns.
</P>
<P>
Published reports advised retirees of a mid-June deadline for
amended returns. As a result, they have been burning up the telephone
lines to tax accountants, members of Congress and the state
legislature demanding information, or clarification of, the alleged
deadline.
</P>
<P>
But tax officials in Richmond asked us to advise retirees -- many in
the Washington area -- that the one year that retirees will have to
file amended returns won't start until there is a final settlement in
the refund battle, which is now five years old.
</P>
<P>
The battle on behalf of ex-federal and military personnel began
when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled (Davis v. Michigan) that more than a
dozen states had discriminated against U.S. retirees by taxing their
pensions while not taxing the pensions of state and local government
retirees between 1985 and 1988. Virginia was one of those states.
</P>
<P>
Most of the states found to be using the discriminatory practice
gave retirees refunds but Virginia -- because it was such a big
financial item in the state that is home to more than 200,000 federal
retirees -- raised new legal objections each time the Supreme Court
told it to pay up.

 Editors:

   Here is an early look at the stories the Los Angeles Times is
considering for its first-edition Page 1 for Friday:

   CHINA-POLICY-TIMES -- WASHINGTON -- President Clinton announces his
recommendation that China retain its favored trade status with the
United States, even though Beijing's communist government has refused
to comply with many U.S. demands for greater attention to human
rights. By John M. Broder.

   CHINA-ASSESS -- WASHINGTON -- President Clinton's abandonment of
linking trade with China to human rights improvements represents a
stunning reversal of the policies he espoused both during his 1992
presidential campaign and during his first year in office.
Administration officials had been insisting that without some further
steps in human rights by the Beijing regime, there was no way the
president could renew China's most-favored-nation trade privileges. In
the end, Clinton gave up. By Jim Mann.

   CLINTON-AIDE-TIMES -- WASHINGTON -- Apparently forgetting the example
of former White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu, a senior aide to
President Clinton this week took a presidential helicopter to rural
Maryland for a golf game, prompting furious complaints by Republicans
and an investigation by the White House. The aide, White House Chief
of Administration David Watkins, might have gone unscathed but for
editors of the Frederick (Md.) News-Post, who, hearing that a White
House helicopter was in their backyard, sent a photographer. The paper
published a photograph of Watkins and two other White House aides
dressed in golfing clothes and carrying clubs back to the helicopter
as a Marine stood by saluting. Watkins has now resigned. By David
Lauter.

   MAIL -- CHICAGO -- The mail lately has seemed defiant of the laws
that govern time and space: Recent bill payments disappear while bank
statements from 1988 suddenly show up. Tens of thousands of
undelivered letters have been discovered in the oddest spots:
smoldering under a railroad viaduct, rotting in a field, in the trunk
of a letter carrier's car, piled in a suburban condo owned by a
mailman. Chicago scores highest on the Mail Misery index. A recent
internal survey found customers more unhappy with service here than
anywhere else in the nation. By Judy Pasternak.

   ABORTION-CALIF -- SAN FRANCISCO -- The California Supreme Court,
ruling for the first time in an abortion protest case, holds that
demonstators can be excluded from a public sidewalk in front of an
abortion clinic to protect patient safety. The 6-1 decision helps
assure California's abortion clinics of legal protection if pickets
threaten patients' emotional health, a protection that could be
extended to targets of other kinds of political demonstrations as
well. It was the first ruling on an abortion case by the high court
since conservatives gained a majority in 1987. By Maura Dolan.

 S. Africa Plans Sharp Increase in Its Arms Exports (Pretoria) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
PRETORIA, South Africa
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
South Africa plans a sharp increase in its
arms exports in the wake of a United Nations Security Council vote
this week to drop its long-standing embargo on the country's arms
trade.
</P>
<P>
The head of Armscor, the state-run arms industry, predicted South
African arms exports would more than double this year to about $500
million in sales. He said South Africa's arms industry, which
flourished during the era of apartheid and international sanctions but
has been contracting since the late 1980s, would be ``increasingly
driven'' by exports.
</P>
<P>
The prospect of South Africa turning into a major arms supplier in
a continent riven by war and carnage has caused some alarm here, but
the post-apartheid government appears tantalized by the jobs and
foreign-exchange revenues that the exports would generate.
</P>
<P>
``I don't think it would be fair to say that a particular country
should not engage in trade in arms,'' President Nelson Mandela said in
a nationally televised interview on the eve of the U.N. action. ``Arms
are for the purpose of defending the sovereignty and integrity of a
country. From that angle, there is nothing wrong with having trade in
arms.''
</P>
<P>
This week, as the Security Council voted to drop its 17-year-old
embargo on arms sales to South Africa and a decade-old ban on arms
purchases from it, the head of another U.N. agency scolded industrial
nations for contributing to the misery and bloodshed in Africa by
peddling arms on this continent.
</P>
<P>
James Gustave Speth, administrator of the U.N. Development Program,
noted that the world's annual revenues from arms sales -- $125 billion
 -- was more than double the annual level of development assistance -- 
$60 billion -- to poor countries in Africa and elsewhere. He called for
arms sales to Africa to be phased out over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Tielman de Waal, executive general manager of Armscor, said South
Africa's highly secretive arms industry already conforms to
international standards that forbid the sale of arms to governments
that suppress their own citizens or otherwise abuse human rights.
</P>
<P>
He said Armscor had supplied the government of Rwanda with about
$30 million worth of small-caliber rifles, grenades and mortars over
the past five years but suspended its shipments last September as the
stirrings of civil war became more apparent.
</P>
<P>
He said Armscor had suspended arms sales to Zaire, a country widely
believed to be supplying arms across its border to the Angolan rebel
movement, known by its Portuguese acronym, UNITA.
</P>
<P>
The trouble with such prohibitions, analysts say, is that once arms
find their way into the marketplace, they have a tendency to fall into
unsavory hands -- a syndrome South Africa knows as well as any country.
Its exceptionally high levels of criminal and political violence have
been fueled by a brisk illegal trade in AK-47s and other light arms
from neighboring Mozambique, where a 15-year civil war ended in 1992.
</P>
<P>
When the United Nations slapped its first arms embargo on South
Africa in 1977, the white-minority government reacted by investing
heavily in an already-sophisticated domestic arms industry. At the
time, South Africa was supporting rebels in nearby Angola and
Mozambique and confronting other neighbors in the so-called front-line
states, which opposed its policy of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
At its peak in the late 1980s, the domestic arms industry here
employed some 150,000 people and was said to be South Africa's largest
exporter of finished manufacturing products. Though all of its
dealings were shrouded in secrecy, it was presumed to be supplying
such states as Somalia, Libya, Sudan, Ethiopia and Sri Lanka. Iraq
used a South African-made long-range cannon during the 1991 Persian
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
De Waal said a 65 percent cut in capital spending on defense has
cut the arms industry work force to 75,000 people. And, because South
Africa is no longer in conflict with its neighbors, the number of
those jobs that rely on exports will grow. Currently, about 15,000
jobs exist because of export sales -- and that will increase in the
coming year to about 35,000.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's artillery, armored vehicles, mine-sweeping vehicles
and the Rooivalk helicopter gunship are said to be competitive in the
export market. In addition to markets in Africa, the arms industry
here hopes to find customers in the Far East, Middle East and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Just how aggressively it will pursue these sales is a matter of
debate within the new government. Though Mandela appeared to give a
green light to arms exports this week, he has spoken and written in
the past in support of universal disarmament.
</P>
<P>
``The new government seems to have a fairly classic division
between hawks and doves on the arms-export question,'' said Laurie
Nathan, head of the Center for Conflict Resolution at the University
of the Western Cape. ``The defense ministers want to keep the industry
alive, while some of the ministers in foreign affairs and in domestic
areas have different priorities.''
</P>
<P>
But Jakkie Cilliers, head of an independent military watchdog
group, said he believes the hawks already have won. ``There's been a
dramatic shift in the African National Congress position in the past
year,'' he said. ``Now that they're the government, their attitude
toward arms exports seems to be, `Let's go for it.' Given economies of
scale, it's the only way they can save the defense industry and the
jobs that go with it.''

 Britain, Ireland Press IRA to Give up Violence (London) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prime Ministers John Major of Britain and Albert Reynolds
of Ireland on Thursday intensified their pressure on the Irish
Republican Army to give up its campaign of violence in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the steps of No. 10 Downing Street after a meeting
Thursday night, they warned Sinn Fein, the IRA's political arm, that
they will not ``wait around'' for the party to respond to their peace
overtures.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders, who last December signed the Downing Street
Declaration offering Sinn Fein a place at Northern Ireland peace talks
if the IRA would stop its attacks, said they would continue
negotiations with politicians in Northern Ireland and the Irish
Republic.
</P>
<P>
``A great deal of progress has been made,'' Major said. ``There's
more to be done, but it is not awaiting an answer from Sinn Fein.''
</P>
<P>
Reynolds added, ``The two governments are not going to wait around
for any more prevarication on either side to stop the violence.''
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams raised peace hopes by
declaring to the British Broadcasting Corp. that his group would make
an official response to the Downing Street peace proposal -- but not
until after European Parliament elections June 9.
</P>
<P>
``I am quite convinced that what is going to come out of this peace
process is a peace settlement,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
But Major dashed cold water on the statement. ``I see nothing new
in what he had to say this morning,'' the prime minister said. ``What
was quite striking was what he didn't say. He made no indication that
he was going to give up violence.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Protestant leaders from Northern Ireland also scorned Adams'
statement. Member of Parliament David Trimble declared that it was all
``some big con job'' designed to force the British into more
concessions.
</P>
<P>
While Major and Reynolds insisted that the peace process was making
progress, others seemed less hopeful.
</P>
<P>
One Republican source told the Irish Times of Dublin: ``You don't
have to study the British response for days, or discuss it for weeks,
to know that it's unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
The killings and bombings have continued since the peace
declaration was issued, with the level of sectarian violence between
Catholics and Protestants higher in the past five months than for the
same period last year.

 Clinton Attacks Draw Sharp Rebuttal From GOP (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Clinton's sharp attacks on congressional
Republicans at a meeting with Democratic leaders drew a quick rebuttal
Thursday from GOP officials, who said Clinton and the Democrats were
running out of excuses for their string of electoral defeats.
</P>
<P>
The partisan exchanges marked an escalation in the election-year
rhetoric of both parties and signaled the outlines of the strategies
each will be using this fall to appeal to voters.
</P>
<P>
In a private meeting with Democratic leaders that came the day
after Democrats lost a traditionally Democratic House seat in
Kentucky, the president lashed out at Republicans as obstructionists,
``fanatics'' held hostage to the religious right and a party carrying
a message of ``hate and fear.''
</P>
<P>
House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., said in an interview
Thursday that he was infuriated by Clinton's attacks. ``We had helped
him all day on the foreign operations bill until they (the Democrats)
took a recess to go over there and hear the president attack us. ... I
think it's a bit ripe.''
</P>
<P>
Gingrich said he could not understand the president coming up to
Capitol Hill to bash Republicans just as the Democrats lost another
special election and as House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., faces possible indictment.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., accused Clinton of ``duplicitous'' behavior
and warned that he was courting disaster on health care by appealing
for Republican support in a bipartisan meeting and then criticizing
GOP lawmakers at a Democratic caucus.
</P>
<P>
``It's duplicitous to come here and meet with Republican leaders
and stress the need for bipartisanship and then walk down the hall and
indicate this is a partisan issue,'' Coats told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Coats acknowledged that other presidents have conducted partisan
pep rallies while trying to negotiate with the opposition but
contended that the tactic is counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
Some Democrats said privately that while Clinton's exhortation to
Democrats to defend the administration's record was helpful, they
feared that the president had overstepped in some of his rhetoric
about the Republicans and the religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Ralph Reed, executive director of the Christian Coalition, said
Clinton's strategy of raising the specter of a Christian conservative
takeover of the Republican Party would be self-defeating.
</P>
<P>
``Everywhere they've tried to make us an issue the Republicans have
won,'' Reed said. ``I just don't think attacks on people of faith or
people's religion resonate. It's a failed strategy and it will
backfire at the ballot box.''
</P>
<P>
But some Clinton strategists believe the Democrats ultimately will
gain by highlighting the activities of religious conservatives,
arguing that while the Christian Coalition may help Republicans in
southern races this fall, their involvement will hurt the party in
other parts of the country this year and in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's charge that Republicans have attempted to thwart the
administration at every turn ignored the role the GOP played last year
in the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement. On that
issue, a majority of Democrats deserted the president and he was was
saved only by strong support from Republicans.
</P>
<P>
It was that victory as much as any single event that helped define
the president's first-year successes and helped turn around public
perceptions of Clinton's performance as president. At the time of the
NAFTA vote, Clinton's approval rating stood at 49 percent in the
Washington Post-ABC News Poll. A month after the NAFTA victory, he had
risen to 58 percent.

 On Crackdown Anniversary, Dissidents Challenge China (Beijing) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five years after the Chinese army crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrations, seven dissidents publicly petitioned the
government Thursday for a reassessment of the 1989 movement and
compensation for the families whose relatives were killed or injured.
</P>
<P>
The activists, led by former student leader Wang Dan, also called
for the release of all prisoners associated with the June 4, 1989
crackdown and for the government to allow those who have been released
from jail to lead normal lives.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made in a petition to the national legislature and
made available to reporters. It is a direct challenge to the
government's characterization of the massive, student-led protests
that swept Beijing and then spread nationwide as a
``counterrevolutionary rebellion.''
</P>
<P>
The dissidents asserted that the 1989 demonstrations were part of
``a nationwide patriotic popular movement.'' The movement adhered to
the principles of ``peace, reason and nonviolence,'' according to the
petition.
</P>
<P>
``We believe the government's characterization of it as a ``riot
and a counterrevolutionary rebellion' is unjust and immediately should
be reassessed,'' the activists wrote.
</P>
<P>
The petition comes a week before the fifth anniversary of the
crackdown, the most sensitive period on China's political calendar.
</P>
<P>
Security recently has tightened visibly in the Chinese capital. The
homes of dissidents and their relatives are under surveillance. Wang
and several other activists have already left Beijing to avoid the
surveillance. Some foreign journalists are being followed. Authorities
have canceled three events sponsored by foreign embassies -- a charity
bazaar, a tennis club dinner and an art exhibit -- even though the
events were to be attended by foreigners only.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin recently defended the use of force to
crush the protests as the only way to ensure stability and continued
economic development. China would not hesitate to use violence again
if necessary, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government has never given a public accounting of the exact
number of dead and wounded from 1989. Hundreds, perhaps thousands,
died when Chinese soldiers opened fire on the protestors. Nor has the
government ever said how many people were arrested in connection with
the June 4 crackdown. Despite the releases of some prominent
activists, human-rights groups estimate that thousands more could
still be in jail.
</P>
<P>
In the petition Thursday, the activists -- several of whom were on
China's most-wanted list of student leaders and who served prison
terms for their participation in the 1989 movement -- said the time had
come for the government to ``untie the knot in the people's heart.''
</P>
<P>
``We feel that the June 4th incident represents an undeniable
``knot' in the Chinese people's historical development. Resolving the
June 4 problems and untying this knot in the people's heart will help
heal social contradictions and promote social stability (and) will
benefit the construction of a democratic legal system and the
advancement of society,'' they wrote.
</P>
<P>
``We sincerely wish that the government can courageously take this
sensible step for the sake of the people's interest and the nation's
future,'' they wrote.

 Black Adults Overwhelmingly Pessimistic About Prospects 
 Of Black Children, Poll Finds (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Black adults are overwhelmingly pessimistic about the
prospects of black children, citing fears of violence, guns, drugs and
gangs, according to a national poll released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The poll, commissioned by the Children's Defense Fund and a new
organization known as the Black Community Crusade for Children, found
that more than three-fourths of black adults fear that their children
or children they know will fall victim to violence. The poll did not
include comparable figures for whites or others.
</P>
<P>
And more than 80 percent of these adults say these are ``really bad
times'' or ``tough times'' for black children. More than 70 percent of
black adults -- many of whom were raised during an era of segregation -- 
believe it is harder for children today than it was for them.
</P>
<P>
``This poll confirms what black leaders already know,'' said
Children's Defense Fund President Marian Wright Edelman. ``We have a
black-child crisis worse than any since slavery.''
</P>
<P>
In releasing the poll, Edelman also unveiled the Black Community
Crusade for Children, a fledgling organization that is mobilizing an
anti-violence campaign, training college students to become tutors and
lobbying for government solutions to the daunting problems facing
black children in this country.
</P>
<P>
The organization is a network of local and regional programs
coordinated by the Children's Defense Fund and funded by foundations.
</P>
<P>
The poll showed that while 75 percent of black children said these
are good times for them personally, they also see major obstacles
ahead. More than three-quarters of these young people said violence in
school is a serious problem for them, 70 percent said the same of guns
and 64 percent said dangerous neighborhoods present a serious problem
for them.
</P>
<P>
``They do have dreams and hopes and ambitions, but they see the
road from here to there is laden with obstacles,'' said Geoffrey
Garin, president of Peter D. Hart Research Associates, which conducted
the poll. The poll was taken in January of 1,004 adults and 421
children aged 11 to 17.
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of adults polled said black children face more problems
than opportunities, and the vast majority believe that at least half
of all black children will become teen-age parents, will be denied
opportunities because of racial prejudice, have their lives destroyed
by drugs or get into trouble with the law.
</P>
<P>
Edelman said the new organization began as an idea three years ago
and has hired a dozen staff members across the country. More than 600
black college students have been trained as tutors and mentors to
children and 200 more will be trained this summer.
</P>
<P>
The group is launching an anti-violence campaign next month and
encouraging black churches to hold a ``children's sabbath'' in
October, with a focus on programs for youth.
</P>
<P>
Several community efforts were cited by Edelman as models of
creative solutions, including ``beacon schools'' in New York City that
stay open until 11 p.m. year-round and operate as community centers; a
program in Savannah, Ga., that remodeled an abandoned school building
and turned it into a resource center where families can get help from
a variety of agencies, including health and social-service offices,
boys and girls clubs and a mediation project; and a ``nurturing
village'' project in the District of Columbia where leaders are
bringing together schools, hospitals and community groups to provide
an after-school program for each of the 20,000 children in the area.

 Fast Action Promised on Vegetable-Based Printing Ink Bill (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It follows in the proud tradition of ethanol, soy
burgers and recycled paper. So how could Congress say no to ``veggie
ink?''
</P>
<P>
Thursday members of a House subcommittee promised swift action on
one of the new darlings of the environmental movement: vegetable-based
printing inks. Soon, they said, most government reports will be
printed on inks made of soybeans and linseed oils. Judging from the
comments of farm state lawmakers, the new inks are so good that
Congress ought to direct the Government Printing Office to crank up
its presses and start turning out even more reports, forms and
documents.
</P>
<P>
Developed in Iowa seven years ago, soybean-based inks were
described Thursday as the quintessential ``green product,''
environmentally friendly, easy to recycle and as cheap as
petroleum-based inks.
</P>
<P>
The proposed Vegetable Ink Printing Act ``does two things right
away,'' Sen. Paul D. Wellstone, D-Minn., explained. ``It promotes
rural America's economy and also protects our environment.''
</P>
<P>
The bill, he said, is one ``I care fiercely about. I think it's a
very, very important piece of legislation.''
</P>
<P>
``It'll save us some environmental headaches down the line,''
agreed Rep. Richard J. Durbin, D-Ill., sponsor of a bill to promote
the government's use of vegetable-based inks. Members of the
Government Operations subcommittee on information, justice,
transportation and agriculture agreed, promising to mark up the bill
shortly after the Memorial Day recess. Last November, the Senate
unanimously approved a similar measure sponsored by Wellstone and Sen.
Christopher S. Bond, R-Mo., following the lead of 26 states that have
endorsed vegetable-based inks for their printing needs.
</P>
<P>
The only objection to Durbin's measure came from the Treasury
Department. It said it still wants to print checks and other security
documents such as money with petroleum-based inks because of
``anti-tampering security features.''

 Doctor Says Tobacco Industry Influenced Research Grants (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The head of the Council for Tobacco Research
acknowledged Thursday that his organization acted as an industry
``conduit,'' steering research grants to favored scientists in hopes
of getting results that reflected positively on the industry.
</P>
<P>
But he insisted that most of the researchers who did work for the
council were ``assured complete scientific freedom.''
</P>
<P>
Dr. James F. Glenn, chairman of the industry-funded council, which
awards scientific grants to researchers studying the relationship
between smoking and health, told the House Energy and Commerce
subcommittee on health that the work supported by his organization
``is performed by independent scientists,'' and that the results are
made available to the public.
</P>
<P>
The council ``does not consider whether the research will be
favorable or not favorable,'' he said. ``We are scientists. ...
Industry exercises no control.''
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by Subcommittee Chairman Rep. Henry A. Waxman,
D-Calif., however, Glenn admitted that the council bypassed a
scientific advisory board of outside experts to award ``special
project'' grants requested by industry lawyers who wanted research
that could bolster the industry 's position in future litigation.
</P>
<P>
Glenn said, however, the council did so because of its own
expertise in administering grants.
</P>
<P>
The existence of such ``special projects'' was first reported in
Thursday's Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
Glenn, a urologist who also serves as chief of staff at the
University of Kentucky Medical College Hospital, said the council has
awarded more than $220 million to fund more that 1,380 projects run by
1,000 researchers.
</P>
<P>
Waxman released a series of documents written in 1953 and 1954 by
officials at Hill and Knowlton, a high-powered public relations firm,
indicating that the council was created solely to counter public
concerns over early studies linking cigarettes to health problems.
</P>
<P>
The public relations firm became involved in planning a
counter-offensive with tobacco company executives after the December,
1953, publication of a study by researchers at the Sloan-Kettering
Institute in New York that showed that cigarette tar condensate causes
fatal cancers when painted on the skin of mice.
</P>
<P>
One early Hill and Knowlton memo written shortly after the release
of the study advised that ``the underlying purpose of any activity at
this stage should be reassurance of the public through wider
communication. ... It is important that the public recognize the
existence of weighty scientific views which hold there is no proof
that cigarette smoking is a cause of lung cancer.''
</P>
<P>
One of their major suggestions was the formation of a special
research committee.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
``The word `research' should be included in the name of the
committee to establish the fact that the group will carry on or
sponsor fundamental scientific research,'' the memo said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it recommended that the group have a research director
who was ``a medical research authority of unquestioned national
repute,'' and an advisory board of ``men whose integrity is beyond
question.''
</P>
<P>
The first public statement of the committee should be ``designed to
reassure the public that the industry's first and foremost interest is
the public health, (and) there is no proof of the claims which link
smoking and lung cancer ... ''
</P>
<P>
Glenn dismissed the papers as ``ancient history'' that occurred
long before he was involved with the group.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Waxman said this ``paints a disturbing picture of
public relations masquerading as science.''

 Ban of Chinese Guns Strikes at Source of U.S. Imports (Beijing) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Clinton's move Thursday banning U.S. imports of
Chinese-made guns strikes at the source of one-third of all firearms
and more than half the rifles brought into America each year.
</P>
<P>
But the import ban may not seriously hurt the Chinese military
conglomerate making most of these weapons. And it does risk
politically alienating the Peoples Liberation Army, a key Chinese
organization with which the United States has been trying to restore
contacts.
</P>
<P>
The United States issued permits last year for the import of about
two million weapons from China, according to figures provided by the
U.S. Embassy here.
</P>
<P>
Most of those were military-style rifles, such as the MAK-90, a
knock-off of the well-known AK-47 assault rifle. Some of these weapons
would be banned by crime bills under consideration by the U.S.
Congress, but one of the most popular makes, the semiautomatic SKS,
would not be affected by the bills.
</P>
<P>
China is the world's lowest-cost producer of rifles and handguns,
and virtually all guns made here come from factories controlled by the
PLA -- particularly the factories of China North Industries Co., also
known as Norinco.
</P>
<P>
Norinco is the Chinese military's largest conglomerate with more
than 300 separate enterprises and research institutes. Like most PLA
companies, it has turned aggressively in recent years to producing and
marketing non-military products.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 percent of the company's income now comes from
civilian products, according to published reports. It claims assets
worth more than $1.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
Norinco makes more than half of China's motorcycles and more than a
third of its mini-vans, at some factories in joint ventures with
Japanese companies. It turns out machines tools, chemicals and
refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
But it also is still believed to take in hundreds of millions of
dollars a year from its exports of heavy or high-tech arms -- sales
that likely dwarf its receipts from exporting handguns and rifles to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the U.S.-gun trade can be lucrative, particularly in
illegally outfitted rifles.
</P>
<P>
Norinco was accused this spring by U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms officials of having violated federal guns laws by
bringing into America tens of thousands of illegal rifles.
</P>
<P>
These rifles were illegally fitted with threaded muzzles to receive
silencers or mounts for grenade launchers. Some could be converted
into machine guns.
</P>
<P>
In announcing a recall of these rifles, ATF officials admitted that
the weapons entered the United States because of the difficulty in
closely checking every shipment within the huge volume of U.S.
imports.
</P>
<P>
For some diplomats here, this suggests that some importers may be
able to circumvent the U.S. ban on Chinese guns by shipping them
through third countries -- much as importers of Chinese-made towels
sidestep U.S. textile quotas by shipping through the Philippines and
other countries.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
``Looks like we'll have something else to work on soon,'' a U.S.
Customs agent based in Asia predicted Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Whether or not the U.S. ban on Chinese guns hits the PLA's
pocketbook very hard, it certainly risks making enemies within the
Chinese military -- a risk at odds with U.S. policy.
</P>
<P>
The PLA is one of China's most powerful political forces. The
Pentagon launched a drive last fall to resume high-level contacts with
the Chinese military, in part because of the belief that it will play
a key role in the likely political struggle following patriarch Deng
Xiaoping's death.
</P>
<P>
``The PLA isn't going to like being singled out in this way,'' a
Western diplomat here said. ``But they're going to be hard pressed to
argue in the international arena for a right to sell guns in the
United States. In fact, even many Chinese can't understand why the
United States has let them sell guns there all along.''

 Clinton Signs Bill Supporting Abortion (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Clinton Thursday signed legislation that
bars antiabortion demonstrators from blocking access to clinics or
threatening patients, decrying ``the extremism and the vigilante
conduct which gave rise to this law.''
</P>
<P>
Two antiabortion groups immediately filed suit to overturn the law,
arguing that it interfered with their constitutional rights of free
speech and religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
Clinton signed the law, the ``Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances
Act,'' at a White House ceremony attended by the children of David
Gunn, the Florida physician who was murdered by an antiabortion
protestor last year.
</P>
<P>
``We simply cannot -- we must not -- continue to allow the attacks,
the incidents of arson, the campaigns of intimidation upon law-abiding
citizens that (have) given rise to this law,'' Clinton said, citing
the murder of Gunn and the shooting of another doctor outside his
clinic in Wichita, Kan., last summer.
</P>
<P>
``No person seeking medical care, no physician providing that care
should have to endure harassments or threats or obstruction or
intimidation or even murder from vigilantes who take the law into
their own hands because they think they know what the law ought to
be,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The law, which has been a priority for the abortion rights
movement, makes it a crime to block access to clinics, damage their
property or injure or intimidate paitents and staff. Approved by the
Senate 69 to 30 this month, following a 241 to 174 House vote, it
calls for jail terms and stiff fines.
</P>
<P>
It was enacted after the Supreme Court ruled last year that an 1871
civil rights law could not be used to halt antiabortion protests and a
Justice Department review concluded existing statutes were inadequate
to deal with the growing problem. Abortion rights supporters say there
have been 3,000 incidents of violence, vandalism and harassment at
abortion clinics since 1977.
</P>
<P>
Antiabortion activists argue that the law punishes them for
legitimate civil disobedience and for expressing their religious
views. The National Right to Life Committee accused the president of
allowing abortion rights supporters to ``crush peaceful protesters'
free speech with federal lawsuits.''
</P>
<P>
Randall Terry of Operation Rescue, the group that has blockaded
clinics across the country, said the law ``shows the ever growing
anti-Christian persecution that is coming from our government.''
</P>
<P>
But the American Civil Liberties Union called the law ``a milestone
in congressional protection for reproductive freedom'' and said it
protects ``peaceful protest and free speech.''
</P>
<P>
Clinton acknowledged ``genuine and deeply felt differences on the
subject of abortion'' but said it was ``time to turn away'' from
expressing those views through violence and ``verbal extremism.''
Responding to critics of the legislation, he said, ``This bill is
designed to eliminate violence and coercion. It is not a strike
against the First Amendment.'' The signing of the bill is the latest
of several changes the Clinton administration has made on behalf of
supporters of abortion rights, who spent the previous 12 years
battling efforts by the Reagan and Bush administrations to limit
abortion rights in Congress and the courts.
</P>
<P>
Since taking office, Clinton has lifted the moratorium on federal
funding of research using fetal tissue, reversed the prohibition
against abortions at military facilities, undone the ``gag rule''
prohibiting federally funded family planning clinics from providing
information about abortion, and -- just last week -- lifted the ban on
importation of RU-486, a drug that induces abortions.

 TV SPOTS: `60 Minutes' Looks at Medal of Honor Impostors 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On CBS' ``60 Minutes'' this Memorial Day weekend, Andy Rooney will
report a full segment on impostors who claim to have been awarded the
Congressional Medal of Honor, the nation's highest military award.
Rooney and producer Robert Forte tracked down some of the 500 living
Americans who say they got the Medal of Honor but in reality did not.
The medal is given for heroism far above and beyond the call of duty,
and, in all U.S. history, has been awarded fewer than 3,500 times. It
is against the law to falsely claim to have been awarded a Medal of
Honor and Rooney shows us pathetic people who crave the recognition of
having done extraordinarily brave acts. While the Defense Department
recently approved the sale of military medals to anyone who wishes to
buy them, the one medal that still can't be purchased is the Medal of
Honor.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Clementine spacecraft -- the first scientific mission to the
moon in 22 years -- has discovered craters at the lunar south pole that
appear to lie in eternal shadow.
</P>
<P>
If the craters never see the sun, scientists say, they may stay
cold enough to hold water that was delivered there eons ago by
crashing comets.
</P>
<P>
If further studies confirm the presence of water in the craters, it
would be the first ever found on the moon.
</P>
<P>
Such lunar ice could one day be mined by explorers to supply their
bases with water or split into hydrogen and oxygen gas to make rocket
fuel.
</P>
<P>
``Don't imagine it as pure cube ice you could put into your
martini,'' said Eugene Shoemaker, of the Lowell Observatory in
Flagstaff, Ariz. ``It's very dirty ice, but it's cold enough.'' At
more than 400 degrees below zero, maybe too cold.
</P>
<P>
Clementine was launched into a lunar orbit Jan. 25. A computer
malfunction on May 7 canceled plans to send it off to photograph an
asteroid on Aug. 31. But scientists say the spacecraft -- relatively
cheap at $75 million -- has accomplished 99 percent of its scientific
mission.
</P>
<P>
Among other Clementine discoveries described Thursday at the
American Geophysical Union meeting in Baltimore:
</P>
<P>
-- The deepest impact crater ever found anywhere in the solar system,
a 7.5-mile-deep basin 1,500 miles across. Called the South Polar Aiken
basin and located near the moon's south pole, it was punched into the
moon's surface 4.5 billion years ago by an object 155 miles across.
</P>
<P>
-- Extremes of high and low altitude on the moon twice as great as
previously believed. Scientists have found a span of more than 12
miles from the highest and lowest spots. That's about the same
difference seen between Earth's deep ocean trenches and highest
mountains.
</P>
<P>
``It turns out the moon is a much lumpier planet than we expected
it to be,'' said Johns Hopkins University geophysicist Maria T. Zuber.
</P>
<P>
The apparent perpetual shadows on the moon's south pole were
discovered after photographs of the pole were animated into a kind of
movie.
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker said Clementine's polar orbit allowed it to take repeated
photographs of the polar region during two full rotations of the moon.
That allowed the photographs to show the craters illuminated from all
directions.
</P>
<P>
Because the sun's angle at the pole is so low, however, the bottoms
of the polar craters appear to remain in the shadows of the
surrounding mountains throughout the lunar day.
</P>
<P>
No water has ever been found on the moon, and any that once existed
in the open there has evaporated into space.
</P>
<P>
But scientists have said since the 1960s that any water molecules
that reached the moon from cometary impacts might stick to the surface
if they landed somewhere that was always shaded from the sun.
</P>
<P>
During its two months in orbit around the moon, Clementine gathered
more than two million images of the lunar surface. Split by filters
into 11 different wavelengths of light, the images have already begun
to reveal previously unknown details of the moon's mineral composition
and geological history.
</P>
<P>
Clementine has produced the first reliable topographic map of the
moon, showing its surface contours in a multi-colored map that is
accurate to within 330 feet.
</P>
<P>
A companion map showing where the moon's gravitation pull is
strongest will help scientists figure out the moon's interior
structures, providing clues to how it was formed and evolved.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
The May 7 computer malfunction caused the spacecraft to fire its
attitude control jets, and they kept firing until their fuel ran out.
Without fuel to point its instruments, Clementine's journey to the
asteroid Geographos became impossible.
</P>
<P>
Controllers have since fired Clementine's larger maneuvering
rockets and returned the craft to an Earth orbit, where Pentagon
scientists will continue to flight-test its systems.

 Clinton Reform to Include Plan to Deny Added Benefits
 To Women Who Have Children While on Welfare, Officials Say (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Clinton has decided to include in his
welfare-reform plan a proposal to allow states to deny additional
benefits to women who have children while they are on welfare,
according to administration officials.
</P>
<P>
Immediately, an unusually broad coalition of 85 civil-rights and
religious organizations, including abortion-rights and anti-abortion
groups, said it will challenge the ``child exclusion'' policy in
federal courts.
</P>
<P>
Civil-rights activists complained that the policy would ``punish
innocent children,'' anti-abortion advocates said it would encourage
abortions and abortion-rights supporters said it would punish welfare
mothers who exercise a personal choice.
</P>
<P>
The decision at a White House policy meeting Tuesday to allow
states to impose ``family caps'' on welfare mothers as a means of
discouraging illegitimate births will be contested in any state that
enacts the policy, said Deborah Lewis, legislative counsel of the
American Civil Liberties Union, one of the coalition's sponsoring
groups.
</P>
<P>
Lewis said the administration's decision to include the provision
in the welfare proposal it is preparing to send to Congress in June
will ``open the floodgates'' of legislation aimed at punishing welfare
mothers. At the same time, she said, it will do nothing to discourage
out-of-wedlock births, which are estimated to represent nearly a third
of all births in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Under current law, states cannot implement such ``family cap''
changes in the Aid to Families With Dependent Children program without
obtaining waivers of provisions of the AFDC law from the Department of
Health and Human Services, which often is a long and complex process.
Only three states -- New Jersey, Georgia and Arkansas -- have received
approval for ``family cap'' plans, while applications from California,
Maryland and Wisconsin are pending.
</P>
<P>
The ACLU and the National Organization for Women have joined to
form the Child Exclusion Coalition, whose member groups range from the
National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League to Feminists
for Life and the Seamless Garment Network, an umbrella of several
hundred groups that oppose abortion.
</P>
<P>
The ACLU and NOW already are contesting New Jersey's family cap
policy in federal court.
</P>
<P>
Also opposing the extension of ``family caps'' are a number of
large religious organizations, including the National Council of
Churches, Catholic Charities of the United States, the National
Council of Jewish Women and the Washington headquarters of the
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)
</P>
<P>
The ``child exclusion'' provision -- one of the most explosive parts
of the Clinton administration's welfare-reform proposals -- is believed
to be the first issue to bring together abortion rights and
anti-abortion factions of the women's movement.
</P>
<P>
Groups both supporting abortion rights and fighting against the
procedure came together earlier this year to help defeat a ``family
cap'' provision in a welfare-reform bill in the Maryland legislature.
Gov. William Donald Schaefer, D, vetoed the bill Thursday because it
did not contain a family cap.
</P>
<P>
``We're surprised the president thinks he can make political gains
on this proposal. It's just going to upset everyone,'' said Lewis.
``It's not a compromise. It's an open invitation to the states to
punish innocent children.''
</P>
<P>
Anti-abortion advocates complained that the policy will encourage
welfare mothers to seek abortions rather than risk losing additional
benefits, even though the additional benefits typically range from $57
to $64 a month for a new child.
</P>
<P>
Noting Clinton's health-reform proposals would cover the cost of
abortions, Sharon Daly, Catholic Charities' deputy to the president
for social policy, said, ``The government is saying `We will pay for
your abortion but we won't pay you $64 a month if you have a child.'
That sounds to us like a pro-abortion decision.''
</P>
<P>
Abortion-rights supporters maintain that if a woman has a right to
exercise a personal choice about having a child, she should not be
punished simply because she is receiving welfare. An administration
official said Clinton decided on the new policy ``because he genuinely
believes, as a former governor, in giving states the maximum amount of
flexibility possible. He believes in allowing governors and
legislatures to decide what works best in their states.''
</P>
<P>
However, the official acknowledged that withholding additional
benefits from welfare mothers who become pregnant has become an even
more emotional issue among liberals and children's rights advocates
than the proposed two-year time limit on welfare, which is the
centerpiece of Clinton's plan to ``end welfare as we know it.''
</P>
<P>
The administration's self-imposed deadline for releasing its final
welfare-reform package has been postponed several times, partly
because of disagreements over how to finance the package and partly
because no decision has been made on what will happen to families who
pass the two-year time limit in a work-training program but are still
unable to find jobs in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Administration officials said the Clinton welfare-reform bill will
be introduced after June 9, when the president returns from
commemorating the 50th anniversary of D-Day in Normandy. They said
Clinton wants to spend $9.3 billion over five years to implement the
reforms, with $7 billion coming from cuts in other social programs and
the rest from excess corporate taxes collected for the Superfund
environmental-cleanup program.

 Many Child Safety Seats for Airliners Are Ineffective (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many child safety seats and restraints that are sold
as approved for use on airliners are ineffective and some are
dangerous, according to research done for the Federal Aviation
Administration.
</P>
<P>
In the first comprehensive crash-dummy tests using simulated
aircraft interiors, the FAA's Civil Aeromedical Institute (CAMI) in
Oklahoma City found that all of the forward-facing seats for 20- to
40-pound children that it tested produced injuries because they could
not be sufficiently anchored to prevent a child's head from striking
the seat ahead. And harnesses and backless booster seats were found to
be dangerous, according to Van Gowdy of CAMI's Biodynamics Laboratory,
who performed the research.
</P>
<P>
Gowdy said the institute found that one type of restraint performed
consistently as advertised: small rear-facing seats for infants below
20 pounds. ``I think these should be encouraged and endorsed by the
FAA and the airlines,'' he said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
The research, which was completed late last year but not released,
adds another element to one of the most emotional safety issues in
aviation. Until now, safety seats have been certified as approved for
both automobiles and airliners, but the CAMI research indicates that
airliners may be sufficiently different from cars to require different
standards.
</P>
<P>
Gowdy said a major problem is that airline lap belts, unlike
automobile seat belts, often do not properly secure a safety seat,
allowing too much forward movement. Even when the forward movement is
within federal standards, a child's head can hit the seat ahead.
</P>
<P>
Of eight forward-facing seats designed for toddlers weighing 20-40
pounds, six produced severe head injuries in crashes and two were
close to the maximum allowable Head Injury Criteria. Some of the seats
are too large for confined airline seats, making them even harder to
mount.
</P>
<P>
``We have found a number of these seats that are incompatible with
airline seats,'' Gowdy said.
</P>
<P>
Gowdy said harnesses also allow too much room for movement. And
child booster seats without backs can result in serious injury, he
said, because airline seat backs are designed to rotate forward. In a
crash, this could crush a child between the booster seat and seat
back.
</P>
<P>
Airlines officials estimate that 40,000 to 50,000 children under 2
travel on airliners daily in the United States, but there are no
statistics on how many use safety seats. Jane R. Goodman, a
spokeswoman for the Association of Flight Attendants, said few parents
ever use child safety seats on flights.
</P>
<P>
The safety issue has been weighed and debated in and out of
Congress and the federal bureaucracy for three decades. It took on
added urgency following the crash of United Airlines Flight 232 at
Sioux City, Iowa, on July 19, 1989, in which two infants were ripped
from their mothers' arms on impact. One was later found dead, while a
second survived after she was heard crying in crash debris.
</P>
<P>
Current FAA rules allow children under 2 to be held in parents'
laps, and airlines generally allow them to fly for free. The FAA in
1992 ruled that airlines must allow use of safety seats, but the
agency has stopped short of requiring them. Such a requirement would
increase travel costs for families, who would have to pay for a seat.
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board, the Association of Flight
Attendants and the major airlines have called for their mandatory use,
pointing out that small children are the only objects that are not
required to be secured on takeoff and landing.
</P>
<P>
``It's totally illogical if we're tying down coffee cups that we're
not restraining these kids,'' said Jo Ellen Deutsch, manager of
government affairs for the Association of Flight Attendants.
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for those organizations said the CAMI study would not
cause them to change their positions. They advised that parents use
existing safety seats until better ones are designed.
</P>
<P>
``The seats, while there may be imperfections, are better than
nothing,'' said Christopher Chiames, spokesman for the Air Transport
Association.
</P>
<P>
FAA officials in Washington declined to discuss the research.
Spokeswoman Sandra Allen said the agency has not had sufficient time
to review the study internally. But sources in the Washington aviation
community said major differences have surfaced between agency
officials over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Linda Daschle, the FAA's new deputy administrator, is said to be
adamantly pushing for a child-restraint requirement. Among those
opposing her is Anthony J. Broderick, the FAA's longtime associate
administrator for regulation and certification. Broderick is said to
have been convinced partly by an FAA-sponsored study by Apogee
Research indicating additional child deaths would result from parents'
decisions to drive rather than fly at greater expense.
</P>
<P>
The safety board has criticized the Apogee report as based on
flawed information.
</P>
<P>
Congressional efforts to impose child-restraint requirements, led
by Rep. Jim Lightfoot, R-Iowa, have been thwarted every year. Rep.
James L. Oberstar, D-Minn., chairman of the House Public Works
aviation subcommittee, opposes the requirement.
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, all new child safety seats bear the stamp, ``This
restraint is certified for use in motor vehicles and aircraft.'' But
the FAA does not routinely test the seats, ruling in March 1985 that
any seat would be considered approved for airline use if it met
applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety rules.

 HAITI-POLICY, which was deleted from the schedule, is now
rescheduled. 
 2 New Combat Ships Are on Way to Haiti to Intercept Small Boats
(Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two of the newest combat ships in the U.S. Navy fleet
 -- high-speed, shallow-draft vessels known as Coastal Patrol Craft -- 
are on their way to Haiti to try to intercept small boats violating
the international embargo against that nation by hugging the shore as
they sail from the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
The USS Cyclone and the USS Tempest will each carry eight Navy
Seals, or nautical commandos, trained in taking over ships and
inspecting suspect cargoes, Pentagon spokesman Dennis Boxx said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Deployment of the Cyclone and Tempest increases the prospects for
cutting off small vessels heading for Haiti's 672-mile coastline, but
it also increases the risk that Navy personnel might be targets of
small-arms fire from smugglers on shore trying to protect their
lucrative traffic, experienced Navy officers said.
</P>
<P>
The Cyclone and Tempest are the first two of 13 Coastal Patrol
Craft ordered by the Navy for use in the limited-scope, post-Cold War
conflicts the U.S. military expects to be engaged in around the globe,
Navy officials said.
</P>
<P>
With an eight-foot draft, top speed of more than 35 knots and a
narrow turning radius, the 170-foot-long Coastal Patrol Craft is much
more capable than full-size warships of interdicting the small craft
running the Haiti embargo, Boxx and other officials said.
</P>
<P>
The patrol craft will join nine other ships already in Haitian
waters enforcing the tighter United Nations sanctions that took effect
last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Also steaming toward the region, though not officially part of the
embargo operation, is the USS Wasp, an amphibious assault ship
carrying about 650 Marines. The Wasp is headed for the U.S. Naval base
at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for ``routine refresher training,'' Navy and
Defense Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
The ships on embargo patrol are authorized to enter Haitian
territorial waters at will, stop and search all vessels, and fire if
necessary to disable ships that refuse to halt, State Department and
Pentagon officials said. The ``rules of engagement'' that determine
when the ships can fire are set entirely by the U.S. military,
officials said, with no consultative Bosnia-style role for the United
Nations, even though it was the U.N. Security Council that imposed the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Navy has become quite familiar with seaborne interdiction
operations in the past few years, first during the 1991 Persian Gulf
War and later as part of a NATO team enforcing the international
embargo on Serbia in the Adriatic Sea. But those operations do not
provide an exact model for Haiti, officers said, because they involved
generally larger vessels in confined bodies of water, with little
coast-hugging traffic.
</P>
<P>
``This is more like trying to intercept drugs in the Caribbean,'' a
senior Navy officer said.``If you are talking about smuggling vessels
using shallow waters, as long as you know where all the ports are you
can set shallow water gate guards to position yourself, if you are
willing to work inside of territorial waters and provided that the
ships you use don't have draft limitations.''
</P>
<P>
Even if all known ports are covered, he said, there is probably
nothing to be done about crude small boats sailed by individuals that
can simply be beached anywhere along the shoreline.
</P>
<P>
Much of the gasoline and other goods still reaching Haiti are going
overland, across the border with the Dominican Republic. Dominican
Republic President Joaquin Balaguer assured President Clinton's
special representative on Haiti, William Gray, on Wednesday that his
country ``would seal its border with Haiti in conformity'' with U.N.
resolutions, State Department spokesman Michael McCurry said Thursday.

 Elite Russian Commando Unit Shows Off New Skills (Balashikha) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BALASHIKHA, Russia
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They were once the toughest, deadliest,
scariest troops to police the Soviet Empire.
</P>
<P>
Named after Felix Dzerzhinsky, founder of the Bolshevik secret
police, the Dzerzhinsky Division liquidated czarist sympathizers,
worked out the formula for the Molotov cocktail and trained snipers to
torment Adolf Hitler's armies.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, the KGB unit did the Kremlin's bidding in such hot
spots as Afghanistan, Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh. Last October,
when hard-liners seized the Russian Parliament building, Boris N.
Yeltsin called in the Dzerzhinsky Division to storm the White House
and save his presidency.
</P>
<P>
Thursday, the gates of the elite division's base swung open to
journalists, and even foreign reporters were invited in for what
commanders said was the first-ever tour of this military holy site
about 15 miles east of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
In a bizarre marriage of Russian military propaganda and
Western-style public relations, the once-terrifying special forces now
seemed eager to show themselves to the media as a tough but
politically correct unit of crime-fighters trained to battle
terrorists, drug traffickers, hijackers and organized criminals. With
convincing displays of smoke bombs and machine-gun fire, young
commandos demonstrated their crime-busting prowess.
</P>
<P>
First came a display of bulletproof vests, helmets, rifles,
pistols, grenade-launchers, stun bombs and tear gas canisters.
</P>
<P>
Then, as the television cameras rolled, sharpshooters in camouflage
burst into a firing range. They pumped bullets straight into their
target, a wooden terrorist who appeared to be commandeering a car,
holding a gun to the driver's head. The shooters left holes in the
terrorist, but the hostage escaped unscathed.
</P>
<P>
Beefy recruits showed how to intercept and liberate a ``hijacked''
bus by posing as road repair workers. In another mock raid, the
commandos stormed a hijacked aircraft, a bullet-ridden old Aeroflot
jet parked at the training ground.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
As if to demonstrate Russia's need for a squad of ``untouchables''
to deal with its skyrocketing crime, while the mock hijackings were
being staged outside Moscow, a very real hijacking of schoolchildren
had begun in southern Russia.
</P>
<P>
Four gunmen seized a bus carrying about 30 people -- eight children,
their parents, and their schoolteachers -- near Mineralniye Vody, a
resort city whose name means ``mineral waters.''
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Thursday that the hijackers had demanded $10
million, as well as 100 vials of morphine, assorted weaponry and a
helicopter in which to flee.
</P>
<P>
By late Thursday, the terrorists had released all the children and
one adult in exchange for four sub-machine guns, a grenade launcher, a
night-vision device and some flak jackets, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported. About 13 adults were still being held.
</P>
<P>
Two groups of elite Interior Ministry troops -- possibly from the
former Dzerzhinsky Division -- were on their way to the site, Tass
said.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
As part of its transformation, the commando unit has dropped the
name Dzerzhinsky and is now simply known as the Special Forces
Division. But the nickname has stuck, and despite financial hardship
it remains one of the most prestigious postings in the Russian
military.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry brass who arranged the tour said the base was
opening now in anticipation of the 70th anniversary of its founding
June 18. Russian journalists suggested a more pragmatic motive: The
federal budget is under discussion in Parliament, the military is so
far getting much less money than it asked for, and some good press
could not hurt.

 Scholars Tell of Nazi Atrocities Against Black POW's (Los Angeles) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LOS ANGELES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scholars searching for ways to broaden the lessons of
the Holocaust told an audience at Los Angeles' most prominent black
church Thursday that Nazis murdered and mutilated African American
prisoners of war because of their race, and sterilized children of
mixed German and African blood.
</P>
<P>
The presentation of previously unpublicized research was organized
by the Martyrs Memorial and Museum of the Holocaust, which is working
with teachers and researchers to develop curriculum supplements for
secondary school students.
</P>
<P>
Researchers told listeners at First A.M.E. Church that documents
from Nazi war-crimes trials show that blacks -- both Americans and
soldiers from Africa serving in the armies of colonial powers -- were
``singled out'' for mistreatment once they were captured by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
In one case, said Robert Kesting, an archivist at the U.S.
Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, 11 captured African American
soldiers were humiliated by S.S. officers and forced to carry them on
their backs before they were tortured, executed and mutilated. Other
black soldiers were forced to dig their own graves before they were
executed.
</P>
<P>
Although white soldiers were also mistreated by Germans, Kesting
said, blacks tended to be treated worse because of their race: Nazis
considered people of African descent, as well as Jews, Gypsies, and
handicapped people as ``race polluters.''
</P>
<P>
In a horrific example of Nazi eugenics -- the pseudo-science of
genetically ``improving'' the human race -- hundreds of half-black,
half-German children, aged 6 to 12, were sterilized under government
dictates in the 1930s, Kesting said.
</P>
<P>
The children, labeled the ``Rhineland bastards,'' were for the most
part the offspring of German women who married African soldiers who
were part of the French army occupying western Germany following World
War I. Hundreds of the children later disappeared without a trace.
</P>
<P>
The 14-year-old Holocaust museum, run by the Jewish Federation
Council of Greater Los Angeles, sponsored Thursday's lecture in
response to the controversy that erupted after some black high school
students in Oakland were kicked out of a movie theater for laughing at
scenes of the murder of Jews in ``Schindler's List.''
</P>
<P>
Educators, struggling to get students interested in history that
seems long ago and far away, said they believe the greater scope of
genocide will hit home to African American students if they are taught
that people of African descent were also been persecuted by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
``(Students need to understand) `It could have been me,' '' said
Suzanne Riveles, a political scientist who teaches at Howard
University and participated in Thursday's lecture.
</P>
<P>
Rev. Leonard Jackson, associate minister of First. A.M.E., says
interest in the Holocaust in the black community is ``little or
nothing.'' ``It is easy to look at a story such as `Schindler's List'
and say, `so what?' But if you realize ... it was not just Jewish
individuals, it was African Americans, black Africans ... that's what
makes a difference.''
</P>
<P>
Museum director Alex Grobman, said the students in Oakland were
unfairly criticized. They were simply unfamiliar with the history and
couldn't understand that the events on screen really happened, he
said. He said he later took several of the students on a tour of the
museum and found them ``very receptive.''

 U.S. Envoy Backs Canada in Dispute With American Farmers 
 (Toronto) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An escalating war of words between the United States and
its largest trading partner has taken an unusual turn, with the U.S.
ambassador lining up behind Canada in its bitter dispute with American
farmers over wheat subsidies.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador James J. Blanchard made front-page headlines Thursday
after he publicly accused U.S. Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy of
anti-Canada agitation in the midst of the politically charged dispute
over Canada's wheat sales to the United States.
</P>
<P>
American farmers and their allies on Capitol Hill contend Canada's
wheat is priced below market rates because of government subsidies.
Canada denies the charge, and its denials have been supported by
binational trade-review panels.
</P>
<P>
In a wide-ranging interview with Canadian television, Blanchard
said he disagreed with Espy's recent representations to South American
leaders that Canada was engaged in ``predatory pricing'' of its wheat
in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
``I don't think (Espy) had the authority from the president'' to
criticize Canadian trading practices, Blanchard said. ``I don't fault
(Canadian Trade Minister) Roy MacLaren for being frustrated,'' he
added. The ambassador repeated his comments in a telephone interview
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Blanchard, a former Michigan governor, and Espy, a former
Mississippi congressman, are Clinton appointees, and both are
described as friends of the president.
</P>
<P>
In a statement Thursday, the Agriculture Department said the White
House ``was well aware of Secretary Espy's trip to South America and
Mexico, and the agenda to be discussed.'' The statement also said:
``The secretary doesn't intend to get into a discussion rebutting,
challenging or contradicting any statement by our ambassador to
Canada. We feel he is doing a good job in a very difficult post.''
</P>
<P>
The latest hostilities began Tuesday, when the normally diplomatic
MacLaren went to Washington and delivered the Canadian government's
most stinging denunciation to date of what it perceives as U.S. trade
belligerence toward Canada. Disputes over wheat, lumber, pork, beer
and steel, ``if allowed to escalate, risk creating a trade and
investment chill between our two countries,'' MacLaren said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. allegations that Canada unfairly subsidizes its grain exports,
the trade minister said, have never been substantiated.
</P>
<P>
Canadian officials have criticized Espy for reportedly encouraging
the governments of Argentina, Brazil and Mexico to launch trade
actions against Canada in retaliation for alleged dumping of wheat in
South America.
</P>
<P>
``It's really difficult to speculate on the secretary's
reasoning,'' Canadian Agriculture Minister Ralph Goodale said on a
television broadcast, ``partly because the comments were so bizarre
and without any factual basis, and now partly because Ambassador
Blanchard has cast some doubt on the veracity of the comments.''
</P>
<P>
Blanchard, in the television interview, said U.S.-Canada trade
disputes are ``minor in the scheme of things,'' but he blasted
Canada's restrictions on imports of U.S. eggs, poultry and dairy
products. ``If you were to look at the commodities that are at issue
right now, I think you can make a strong case that Canada is far more
protectionist than the U.S.,'' he said.

 Italian Leader Rejects Western Complaints About 
 Presence of Mussolini's Political Heirs in His Government (Rome) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi Thursday rejected
recent complaints from other Western leaders about the presence of
Mussolini's political heirs in his government, saying they bore no
relation to extreme-right forces elsewhere in Europe.
</P>
<P>
In his first extended interview since taking office two weeks ago,
Berlusconi insisted that the five cabinet ministers he appointed from
the National Alliance, a ruling coalition partner that has its roots
in the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement (MSI), have nothing in
common with the political ideals of the fascist dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
``One is a former Christian Democrat, two are former members of the
Liberal Party and two belonged to a branch of the MSI that renounced
any ties to fascism,'' the 57 year-old media tycoon explained during
the hour-long conversation in his office at Chigi Palace.
</P>
<P>
``I have obtained a solemn declaration from the National Alliance
saying they are against fascism and any form of despotism. Its leaders
have said this publicly and in party congresses.
</P>
<P>
``Fascists do not exist in my government. They do not exist. There
is nobody in my government who is against liberty and democracy.''
</P>
<P>
While the Clinton administration has backed the Berlusconi
government and declared that it perceives no danger of a fascist
revival in Italy, other Western allies, such as France and Germany,
have expressed alarm that a government role for Italy's fascist
descendants could encourage greater political legitimacy for neo-Nazis
and right-wing extremists in their own countries.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, French President Francois Mitterrand and Germany's
president-elect, Roman Herzog, called for more determined resistance
against rightist movements espousing intolerance or xenophobia. They
warned against further gains in credibility for the extreme right
after Italy became the first West European government in 50 years to
embrace a party identified with neo-fascism.
</P>
<P>
But Berlusconi contended that Italy's fascist legacy could not be
compared with the growth of right-wing extremism in France and
Germany. ``The two phenomena are completely different. The forces of
the extreme right faced by the Germans and the French are not at all
like what is happening in Italy with the National Alliance.''
</P>
<P>
Berlusconi was quick to deny that there was any sympathy in his own
past for Mussolini. ``I was then very small, but my father was
persecuted by the fascists and forced to live abroad, and my
grandfather hid for two nights under a bridge while the fascists
hunted him down.''

 Special Counsel Expects to Complete Initial Phase 
 Of Whitewater Probe Next Month (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. notified House
leaders Thursday he expects to complete the initial phase of his
Whitewater investigation next month, a timetable that could clear the
way for Congress to hold the first hearings this summer.
</P>
<P>
Those hearings would be confined to questions about the death of
White House deputy counsel Vincent Foster and the propriety of
Washington meetings between White House aides and Treasury Department
officials concerning the failed Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan in
Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
Fiske said his inquiry into those areas would conclude, ``barring
some development'' in the last two weeks of June and he would then be
able to tell lawmakers if he objected to hearings on subjects he is
investigating in Washington.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said the earliest the House
could hold hearings on those two aspects of the Whitewater
investigation would be in late July or early August.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine,
said Mitchell anticipates that Senate hearings could begin ``sometime
in July,'' probably about a month after Fiske actually completes the
first phase of his probe.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell was briefed by Foley on the meeting with Fiske and planned
to lay out his position on timing in a letter to Minority Leader
Robert J. Dole, R-Kan., with whom he has been negotiating over
timetable, structure and scope of hearings for about two months.
</P>
<P>
Fiske asked congressional leaders in March to delay hearings that
would delve into aspects of his broad investigation until after his
staff has interviewed relevant witnesses.
</P>
<P>
House and Senate leaders have indicated a willingness to comply
with Fiske's wishes under nearly identical resolutions both bodies
passed in March calling for bipartisan agreement to hold the hearings.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting Thursday with Foley, House Majority Leader Richard
A. Gephardt, D-Mo., and House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel,
R-Ill., Fiske said he noted that the investigation into Arkansas-based
matters, including the past investments of President Clinton and First
Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Whitewater Development Co., was
incomplete and will not be done anytime within the next few months.
</P>
<P>
Foley quoted Fiske as expressing ``worry or concern'' that
lawmakers would try to use hearings on Foster's suicide and the
Washington meetings to explore other matters still under investigation
by his office.
</P>
<P>
A note of impatience with the scheduling of House hearings on any
aspect of Fiske's investigation came from House Minority Whip Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., who warned that hearings might extend into the fall
campaign season -- a uncomfortable prospect for Democrats -- unless
committee investigators get the go-ahead to proceed with advance
research right away.
</P>
<P>
``If we've done all the preparation for hearings, we can act fairly
quickly once Fiske says it's okay,'' Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
In the House and Senate, the structure of Whitewater hearings
remains undecided and subject to partisan dispute.
</P>
<P>
Foley said, ``It might be better to have one committee do whatever
hearings'' and identified the Banking, Urban Affairs and Finance
Committee as ``the most likely committee.'' Rep. James A. Leach,
R-Iowa, who has pressed for disclosure of government documents related
to Madison and Whitewater, is the panel's top Republican.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich named four committees that could claim jurisdiction over
some part of the Whitewater investigation and said ``the only
alternative would be a select committee,'' an alternative that Foley
has consistently sought to discourage.
</P>
<P>
In the Senate, Republicans served notice Thursday they will start
amending bills to force hearings if Mitchell has not reached agreement
with Dole on plans for the hearings by June 7, when Congress returns
from its Memorial Day recess.
</P>
<P>
Republican sources said GOP senators dropped earlier plans to start
offering amendments before the recess when Dole assured them he was
making progress in his talks with Mitchell and believed agreement was
near.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell has urged that hearings be conducted by the banking
committee, with questions that fall under jurisdiction of other panels
being handled by members who serve on those panels as well the banking
committee. Democrats outnumber Republicans 11 to 8 on the banking
committee.

 Records Raise Questions on Clinton Commodity Trading (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hillary Rodham Clinton was allowed to order 10 cattle
futures contracts, normally a $12,000 investment, in her first
commodity trade in 1978 although she only had $1,000 in her account at
the time, according to trade records the White House released
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The computerized records of her trades, which the White House
obtained from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, explain for the first
time how she was able to turn her initial investment into $6,300
overnight. In about 10 months of trading, she made nearly $100,000,
relying heavily on advice from her friend James B. Blair, an
experienced futures trader.
</P>
<P>
The new records also raise the possibility that some of her profits
 -- as much as $40,000 -- came from trades actually ordered by someone
else and allocated to her account, according to Leo Melamed, a former
chairman of the Merc who reviewed the records for the White House.
Merc records obtained by The Washington Post show that her broker,
Robert L. ``Red'' Bone of Ray E. Friedman and Co. (Refco) was making
large orders in 1979 and allocating them to customers' accounts, a
violation of Merc regulations.
</P>
<P>
Melamed said the discrepancies in Clinton's records could have been
caused by human error and even allocations would not necessarily have
benefited Clinton. ``I have no reason to change my original
assessment. Mrs. Clinton violated no rules in the course of her
transactions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Lisa Caputo, Clinton's spokeswoman, said the documents were
released Thursday ``to give as complete a picture as possible'' of her
trades. She said Clinton had never before seen them.
</P>
<P>
Blair, who urged Clinton to enter the high-risk futures market and
ordered most of her trades, said in a recent interview that he
``talked her into'' her first futures trade in October 1978 before
paperwork on her account was completed. It was liquidated quickly, he
recalled, because ``it was bigger than she wanted and required more
money.''
</P>
<P>
A close examination of her individual trades underscores Blair's
pivotal role. It also shows that Bone, who ran Refco's Springdale,
Ark., office, allowed Clinton to initiate and maintain many trading
positions -- besides the first -- when she did not have enough money in
her account to cover them.
</P>
<P>
Why would Bone do so? Bone could not be reached for comment, but
Blair said he thought he knew why. ``I was a very good customer,'' he
said, noting he paid Bone $800,000 in commissions over the years.
``They weren't going to hassle me. If I brought them somebody, they
weren't going to hassle them.''
</P>
<P>
Besides, he added, Bone would not worry if he agreed with his
clients' bet on which way the price of a given contract would go.
</P>
<P>
Blair, who was outside counsel to Tyson Foods Inc., Arkansas'
largest employer, at the time, says he was advising Clinton out of
friendship, not to seek political gain for his state-regulated client.
At the time of the trades, Bill Clinton was governor.
</P>
<P>
Hillary Clinton has said she made all the trading decisions herself
and has tried to play down Blair's role. But she acknowledged in
April, three weeks after her trades were first disclosed, that Blair
actually placed most of the trades.
</P>
<P>
Blair advised Clinton again on July 17, 1979. He recalled that she
started that trading day by losing $26,460 on 10 cattle contracts she
had held for more than a month, by far her worst loss as a futures
player. On his recommendation, he said, she immediately went back into
the market. She acquired 50 new cattle contracts -- worth $1.4 million
 -- and when the price moved in her favor, unloaded them around noon for
a quick gain of $10,550. This recouped part of her loss.
</P>
<P>
Blair said Clinton and other friends he suggested trades for had
lost money that spring on feeder cattle. Those trades ``caused
everyone some grief,'' he said. ``I'm sure I was pressing to get
everyone back above water'' in recommending the quick and bold day
trade.
</P>
<P>
The White House defense of Hillary Clinton's preferential treatment
was that other customers in the same office also were allowed to trade
without having enough cash in their accounts. It was akin to a poker
game where some of the players did not have to pay the ante up money.
</P>
<P>
While Clinton's account was wildly successful to an outsider, it
was small compared to what others were making in the cattle futures
market in the 1978-79 period. An investigation of the cattle futures
market at that time by Rep. Neal Smith, D-Iowa, found that in one
16-month period 32 traders made more than $110 million in profits from
large trades -- those of 50 contracts or more. Clinton traded positions
of 50 or more contracts only three times.
</P>
<P>
The records the White House released Thursday were part of an
investigative file from 1979, when the exchange charged Bone and Refco
with violations of its record keeping and margin requirement rules.
Bone was suspended for three years; Refco paid a $250,000 fine, then
the largest in the exchange's history. Internal memoes from that
investigation cover transactions from the same period in June that
Clinton was trading, but not the same trades. In one instance, the
Merc found Bone and a fellow broker were ordering 1,000 cattle
contracts at a time -- far over the limit allowed at the time and then
allocating them to other customers.
</P>
<P>
One internal Merc memo said ``there is reason to believe'' that a
majority of Bone's accounts were traded without the clients'
permission. Blair said that Bone at times traded his personal account
without permission. ``If your back was turned and the market was dull
he was capable of sprinkling around stuff, including in my account,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
Blair said he doubted Bone traded Clinton's account without her
permission. ``He didn't have the level of comfort screwing around with
others as he did with my account.''
</P>
<P>
Blair said Clinton's trades paralleled his own. She ``was never a
total risk taker,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
At times though, Clinton took what seemed to be enormously risky
trading positions for someone whose salary as a lawyer at the time was
$24,250. For example, after trading five or 10 cattle contracts at a
time in October and November 1978, she suddenly took a 60-contract
order in December. This was a high-stakes gamble in which she could
make or lose up to $36,000 a day.
</P>
<P>
Blair recalled the position was liquidated quickly ``because she
wouldn't have had the money to hold it very long.''
</P>
<P>
He was right. She had about $6,000 in her account at the
time-instead of the required $72,000. She liquidated that position the
next day, making a $7,250 profit overnight, before paying commissions.
</P>
<P>
In a news conference last month, Clinton told reporters she quit
trading at Refco in July 1979. ``I just couldn't bear the risk
anymore.''

 Mexican Officials Deny Persecuting Aburto Family (Mexico City) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mexican officials Thursday denied claims by the
relatives of Mario Aburto Martinez, the man accused of killing
presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, that they have been
persecuted or prevented from testifying in the case.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the attorney general's office contradicted the
claims of six Aburto family members who asked for political asylum in
the United States earlier this week. The family has since dropped
their asylum request and are seeking permission to stay in the United
States temporarily, lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a source close to the murder investigation denied that
Ruben Aburto, the suspect's father, has any pending arrest warrants
that would prevent him from returning to Mexico to tell police what he
knows.
</P>
<P>
Investigators would even be willing go to Los Angeles, where the
elder Aburto lives, to take his statement, the source said.
</P>
<P>
The father has said that, before the shooting, his son met with a
federal security agent who was arrested at the scene and later
released. The accusation hints at a government plot to kill Colosio,
the candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party who was
almost certain to be elected president.
</P>
<P>
Aburto's U.S. lawyer said he has not told Mexican authorities about
his son's meeting because he is wanted in Mexico for the 1967 murders
of two men. He said he would not return to Mexico unless he received a
guarantee of immunity from prosecution in that case. That arrest
warrant was suspended in 1981, the source said.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Other relatives of Aburto have been questioned, but no arrest
warrants have been issued for them, according to the attorney
general's statement.
</P>
<P>
``Mexican officials are not pursuing, pressuring or harassing these
people, and they may return to the country with no fear for their
freedom,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Aburto's mother, brother sisters and other relatives walked across
the U.S.-Mexico border Sunday. The six told U.S. Immigration agents
they feared for their lives because of harassment by Mexican
authorities since Aburto's arrest immediately after the March 23
assassination.

 Rostenkowski Mulls Whether to Plead or Fight (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with a painful choice between accepting a plea
bargain on felony charges or fighting them in a costly trial, an
anguished Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., isolated himself Thursday as
he weighed a decision that seemed likely to end his congressional
career.
</P>
<P>
The well-known and occasionally feared ``Rosty'' rebuffed
questioners and stayed away from most colleagues, holing up in an
office reserved for him as chairman of the powerful Ways and Means
committee.
</P>
<P>
Sources familiar with the extended talks between U.S. Attorney Eric
Holder Jr. and Rostenkowski's lawyer, Robert S. Bennett, said they did
not expect the issue to be resolved until next week.
</P>
<P>
While Holder is pressing for a decision by Tuesday -- the date for
the next meeting of a federal grand jury considering evidence in the
two-year investigation -- the sources said the deadline could slip if a
plea agreement was in sight.
</P>
<P>
Early in the day, an aide vehemently denied broadcast reports that
Rostenkowski had decided to reject all attempts by his lawyers to
negotiate a plea bargain that would require him to admit guilt, serve
time in prison and resign from Congress.
</P>
<P>
``No decision has been made,'' the spokesman insisted as reporters
kept close watch whenever Rostenkowski darted out to vote on the House
floor. Rep. William O. Lipinski, D-Ill., a Chicago colleague, was one
of the few visitors admitted to Rostenkowski's inner sanctum.
</P>
<P>
If the gruff-talking Chicago Democrat balks at a plea agreement,
however, it was widely expected that he would be indicted on multiple
felony charges that would remove him automatically from the
chairmanship of Ways and Means, under rules of the Democratic caucus.
Longtime associates said Rostenkowski would resign his seat in the
House if he even temporarily lost the influential post.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, a plea bargain almost certainly would either
require Rostenkowski to resign from the House altogether, or create a
political backlash that would force him out of office.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
While it was impossible to foretell the outcome, it was clear that
Rostenkowski would not be rushed. ``Did you ever know him to make an
important decision without going to the deadline and five minutes
beyond that?'' asked one Rostenkowski aide.
</P>
<P>
At issue in the plea bargain talks is the precise wording of the
crime or crimes for which Rostenkowski would have to acknowledge
guilt. Under the law, this language would affect the amount of prison
time under federal sentencing guidelines.
</P>
<P>
As Congress departed on a Memorial Day break, tourists began
snapping pictures of the door to the Ways and Means office, which
bears a sign saying: ``Mr. Rostenkowski.'' A young congressional aide
conducting a guided tour told a group of visitors: ``You might be some
of the last to see that name on the door.''

 White House Aide Forced to Resign After Golf Trip by Copter (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A senior White House official was forced to resign
Thursday after he and a colleague took the presidential helicopter,
Marine One, from Washington to a private country club near Camp David,
Md., for an afternoon golf game Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
David Watkins, director of the White House Office of Administration
and one of the Arkansas friends President Clinton brought with him to
Washington, submitted his resignation after his outing with Alphonso
Maldon Jr., director of the White House Military Office, became
public.
</P>
<P>
A picture of the White House officials was published Wednesday in
the Frederick (Md.) News-Post, making the quiet trip a public
embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
Clinton announced the resignation when asked about the trip at a
White House news conference Thursday afternoon. He said he knew
nothing of the trip, which the press office Thursday morning had
described as a routine effort to check out the course for Clinton's
later use. The president said taxpayers would be reimbursed the cost
of the helicopter trip, from Washington to New Market, Md., and back.
If previous Pentagon estimates of the cost of military helicopter use
hold true, that could be about $10,000.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he was ``very upset'' when he heard about the trip,
and officials said Watkins had virtually no defenders in the White
House. Last year, he had been disciplined for his role in the firing
of the seven employes in the travel office.
</P>
<P>
The White House Thursday night said Maldon, a political appointee,
``has been reprimanded and will be reassigned,'' probably outside the
White House.
</P>
<P>
The White House Wednesday night and Thursday morning put out what
officials now realize was a cover story for the trip. It asserted that
Watkins and Maldon were checking out the course for security and other
reasons in advance of a possible presidential trip.
</P>
<P>
A statement drafted by the White House military office and released
to reporters by the country club and used by White House spokesman
Arthur Jones described the helicopter trip as a ``training mission''
to familiarize the crew with the layout of the course, which is an
hour away by car.
</P>
<P>
The subsequent golf game by Watkins and Maldon, the statement said,
was conducted ``in order to familiarize themselves with all aspects of
the course, especially those aspects related to actual time of play
and associated impact of security plans.''
</P>
<P>
But, as White House officials later acknowledged, neither Watkins
nor Maldon have job duties involving checking out sites for
presidential security -- and White House press secretary Dee Dee Myers
said the president has no plans to play the course.
</P>
<P>
Clinton generally travels by motorcade on his frequent golf outings
rather than by military helicopter, which costs between $5,000 and
$8,000 an hour to operate. There are at least three of the white-top
helicopters in the presidential fleet; whichever one the president is
in is designated Marine One.
</P>
<P>
The helicopter has been so sacrosanct in previous administrations
that highest-ranking officials requesting to use it, such as former
chief of staff Donald Regan to visit Ronald Reagan in the hospital,
have been turned down. The use is controlled by the military office,
under rules established by the White House.
</P>
<P>
Myers said Clinton ``was very concerned when he learned about
this'' and had directed Chief of Staff Thomas F. ``Mack'' McLarty to
investigate the matter. Officials said McLarty and others began
looking into the issue Wednesday night, and Watkins was, as one
official put it, ``made aware by Thursday morning his resignation
would be in order.'
</P>
<P>
``The explanation was basically that they were checking out the
golf course for the president in case he wanted to play on that
course,'' a senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
McLarty and Watkins, the official said, ``quickly came to an
agreement that Watkins couldn't effectively continue in his role and
Mack agreed to accept his resignation.'' The official called it ``a
pretty serious error in judgment -- taking off in the middle of a work
week, taking a military helicopter, playing 18 holes of golf, and
taking a military helicopter back to the White House when you've got a
golf course that's an hour's drive away.''
</P>
<P>
The Tuesday trip by Watkins, who like the president and McLarty is
a native of Hope, Ark., and Maldon was captured on film by Skip
Lawrence, a photographer for the News-Post. They invited the Holly
Hills club pro and the commanding naval officer at Camp David to
complete the foursome.
</P>
<P>
Maryland Republican Rep. Roscoe Bartlett saw the photo in his local
paper and issued an outraged press release, photo attached.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the uproar when Bush administration Chief of Staff John
H. Sununu used government planes for private business, Bartlett asked,
``Was it really necessary for your staff to play a course to determine
if it was suitable for a presidential visit?''
</P>
<P>
The president issued an executive order early in his term banning
use of White House aircraft unless necessary for official duties.
``The taxpayers should pay no more than absolutely necessary to
transport government officials,'' the order states.
</P>
<P>
Watkins, 52, is a veteran of Clinton's political campaigns and a
former Little Rock advertising executive, and he and Hillary Rodham
Clinton are former business partners. They were in a lucrative
cellular-telephone partnership in Arkansas in 1983 in which Hillary
Clinton made $48,000 from a $2,000 investment.
</P>
<P>
Watkins is now charged with overseeing the White House
administrative structure. The White House review of the travel-office
firings concluded Watkins was ``insensitive'' to the implications of
revealing that the FBI was investigating the employees. The report
questioned his judgment in ordering a review of the office by a woman
who had expressed interest in running the office, and said he failed
to consider the implications of summarily firing the employees.

 Law Against Abortion Clinic Protests Challenged in 2 Courts (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A broad new federal ban on the use of force or threats
to stop abortions ran immediately into constitutional challenges in
two courts Thursday just after President Clinton's signature made it a
law.
</P>
<P>
Although the law to protect abortion clinics, their patients and
staffs took effect immediately, abortion foes asked judges here and in
Alexandria, Va., to prohibit the government from enforcing it.
</P>
<P>
The challengers contended that the law will curb their free speech
rights, and stop them from expressing their religious opposition to
abortion -- even by peaceful gestures like praying and verbally urging
women entering clinics not to have abortion.
</P>
<P>
The challengers asked for a hearing in the Alexandria case a week
from Friday. That case is expected to move more rapidly than the one
filed in a federal court here, since the Alexandria court is known for
what lawyers and staff call its ``rocket docket.'' Delays are seldom
tolerated.
</P>
<P>
Even if the Justice Department does get temporary clearance to
enforce the new criminal law, it is expected to be tied up in court
battles for several months, and perhaps longer. Both sides expect the
constitutional dispute to go eventually to the Supreme Court. In a few
weeks, the court may give some guidance on the scope of clinic
protesters' free speech rights, in a pending case from Melbourne, Fla.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, surrounded at a White House ceremony at midday Thursday by
abortion rights leaders and congressional sponsors of the new law,
used the occasion to urge Americans to talk out their differences on
abortion and to stop violence around clinics.
</P>
<P>
``There is so much ... we could be doing together to defuse the
intense anger and animosity and to listen to one another,'' the
president said.
</P>
<P>
Among those in the audience were the two children of the late Dr.
David Gunn, who was murdered by an abortion foe outside a Pensacola,
Fla., clinic 14 months ago -- an incident that added pressure on
Congress to pass the new law.
</P>
<P>
The law, the strongest action taken by Congress to protect women
seeking abortions and clinic staff members, provides criminal
penalties up to a maximum of three years in prison and a $250,000
fine. If someone is killed in an anti-abortion activity, the sentence
can be life in prison. The law also allows clinics to sue for
unlimited civil damages when they or their patients or staff members
have been harmed, threatened or intimidated.
</P>
<P>
Those who drafted the law in Congress, and abortion rights groups,
have argued that the measure was written carefully to reach only
violent actions. Clinton stressed that point in signing it, saying
that it would serve only ``to eliminate violence and coercion.''
</P>
<P>
The president argued: ``It is not a strike against the First
Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
That point, however, was disputed directly in the legal claims made
in the two new lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
In the case in U.S. District Court here, papers filed by Atlanta
lawyer Jay Alan Sekulow said that abortion foes ``are fearful'' that
the law could lead to prosecution and heavy punishment for such
protest activities as staging sit-ins, passing out pictures of aborted
fetuses, preaching, picketing and ``sidewalk counseling'' of patients
on the way to get abortions.
</P>
<P>
Suing in that case were Randall A. Terry of Harpersville, N.Y., who
heads Operation Rescue, one of the nation's most militant
anti-abortion groups, along with five other individuals who said they
have been active in trying to stop women from having abortions.
</P>
<P>
In the case in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Washington lawyer
Marion Edwyn Harrison said in court papers that the new law will
criminalize ``activities substantially identical in form and substance
to the civil rights `freedom rides' and `sit-ins' of the 1960s, and to
the nonviolent protest tactics'' of Gandhi, the hero of India's
national independence.
</P>
<P>
The only difference, that lawsuit claimed, is that the activities
now being turned into crimes are those carried out by ``persons who
oppose abortion.'' That lawsuit was filed by the American Life League,
an anti-abortion group based in Stafford, Va., by a Stafford Catholic
priest and three other Virginia opponents of abortion.
</P>
<P>
Both lawsuits were aimed directly at Attorney General Janet Reno,
who lobbied Congress hard for the new measure and who has vowed strong
enforcement of it by her aides in the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
Reno said at Wednesday's bill-signing ceremony that the killing of
Gunn last year in Florida ``focused for me and focused the attention
of the nation on the problem of violent attacks against abortion
providers, vandalism at abortion clinics, and the efforts by some to
prevent women from exercising their constitutional right to choose to
have an abortion.''
</P>
<P>
Vice President Al Gore praised the bill as a ``freedom of access''
measure.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, in his remarks, said that ``with this legislation, we will
have a law with teeth to deal with those who take part in unlawful
activities, who put themselves above and beyond the law.'' He said
there was ``a trend running in this country'' of people taking the law
into their own hands to ``wreak violence ... and verbal extremism.''

 Clinton's Choice: Strategic Imperative vs. Human Rights (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Clinton's decision Thursday to move human
rights to the margins of American dealings with China underlines the
administration's cold calculation that emphasis on rights had gotten
in the way of other priorities.
</P>
<P>
In eliminating his threat to revoke China's trade privileges over
human rights abuses, Clinton has dropped an assumption implicit in his
original policy: that cooperation with China on regional and world
issues is best obtained with a China devoted to basic human rights.
</P>
<P>
Instead of trying to force liberalization in China with some of the
most powerful tools available to the United States, Clinton's hope now
is that active engagement with China -- coupled with the theoretically
liberalizing effects of free market measures -- eventually will produce
a less autocratic China.
</P>
<P>
While pledging to continue to pressure China on human rights,
Clinton couched his change of heart in economic and geopolitical
terms, citing U.S. interest in profiting from Asia's economic boom and
thwarting North Korea's nuclear weapons program. Good relations with
China are pivotal for both.
</P>
<P>
``I believe ... this is in the strategic, economic and political
interests of the United States,'' Clinton said of his policy shift.
</P>
<P>
This is far from the first time that idealistic leanings failed to
survive in policy. The conflict between strategic imperatives on the
one hand and idealistic approaches on the other have undermined
initial Clinton policies on Bosnia, Somalia and Haiti.
</P>
<P>
In the weeks leading up to the China decision, Clinton was
bombarded with advice from influential members of Congress not to
discard a key relationship with a major world power.
</P>
<P>
In practice, human rights pressure appears to be most applicable
when the cost to American interests, particularly economic, is little.
Say Nicaragua or Argentina, for instance, but not China, or for that
matter, oil-rich Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The decision to renew China's most favored nation (MFN) status was
pressed on Clinton by groups whose efforts complemented one another.
American businessmen, eager to cash in on China's dynamic markets as
well as maintain access to China's low cost labor, pressed for Clinton
to lift the trade threat. They were backed by economic advisors to the
president who openly called on him to extend trade privileges
unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
At the Pentagon and within the State Department, fears grew that
China would be lost as a strategic partner if China's MFN status were
revoked. The Defense Department worried about forefeiting contact with
the world's largest army. American diplomats were seeking China's help
to press North Korea to end its nuclear weapons program. They also
want China to sign onto a global nuclear test ban treaty as well as
stop selling chemical waeapons technology and missile equipment to
conflictive Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
Since March, no top administration official supported revocation of
MFN. Recently, Winston Lord, assistant secretary of state for East
Asia and Pacific affairs, hinted that the adminstration needed to
reassess its priorities in Asia. In a memo to Secretary of State
Christopher, he warned of a ``malaise'' in relations with East Asia,
stemming in part from the dispute over human rights with Beijing.
``Asians and others ... criticize us for tactics that destabilize
relationships which are central to the region's peace and stability,''
he wrote.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's decision to back away from the trade threat in effect
exposed a major shortcoming of his China policy. His ultimate goal was
to encourage China's integration into the world economy and
international diplomacy, and through human rights, its adherence to
shared values. The threat to withdraw China's MFN status, the basis of
trade with the United States, pitted two vehicles for China's
integration against each other.
</P>
<P>
If China failed on human rights, trade privileges would be
withdrawn. If trade was disrupted, cooperation on other issues
probably would have disintegrated and the adverse consequences for
China's economy might have resulted in intensified repression.
</P>
<P>
Clinton had put the fate of his entire China policy at the mercy of
Chinese decisions on one aspect of it, human rights. ``In effect,''
China expert A. Doak Barnett said in a lecture last month, Clinton's
threat ``made the entire U.S. relationship hostage to Beijing's
willingness to fulfill specific U.S. demands related to human
rights.''
</P>
<P>
Last May, when the threat was made, the risk was seen as slight.
The conditions were designed to be easy to meet. But by late summer,
some State Department officials already were worrying about the
effectiveness of the U.S. approach, and in the autumn the
administration began a series of meetings with Chinese leaders,
including military-to-military contact, which culminated in a summit
in November between Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
But China's further gestures were slow in coming, and when they
arrived, they were eclipsed by high-profile political crackdowns,
particularly on the eve of Christopher's visit to China in March to
plead for more progress on human rights. Intelligence analysts
cautioned that China did not take Clinton's threat seriously and could
be expected to make no more than minor gestures.

 Sick Canadian Climber Rescued Near Mt. Everest Summit 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Canadian climber who collapsed near the summit of Mount Everest
was carried off the mountain in a dramatic rescue effort Thursday.
</P>
<P>
John McIsaac, 39, of Canmore, Alberta, was reported resting at the
expedition base camp, suffering from pneumonia and pulmonary edema, a
potentially fatal altitude sickness in which the lungs fill with
fluid. He was being monitored by three doctors, who were to decide
Friday morning whether to evacuate him to Nepal's capital, Katmandu.
</P>
<P>
McIsaac, seeking to become the first Canadian to ascend Everest
without bottled oxygen, climbed to within 1,150 feet of the summit
Wednesday when he was forced back by exhaustion. Within hours, he
began showing signs of pulmonary edema. Unable to walk, McIsaac was
carried down the world's highest mountain Thursday in a heavy vinyl
Gamov bag, which acts as a portable compression chamber, according to
Maggie Calloway, an expedition spokeswoman in Vancouver who spoke to
the climbing party by cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
McIsaac was reportedly suffering from exhaustion and frostbitten
fingers when he gave up his 16-hour final assault on the summit.
Earlier, another climber on the Canadian expedition, Denis Brown, also
abandoned his summit attempt.
</P>
<P>
The Canadians were using the northern, or Tibetan, route up the
mountain, which straddles the border of Tibet and Nepal. The
29,028-foot Everest first was climbed by Tenzing Norkay and Sir Edmund
Hillary in 1953. More than 30 climbers have reached the top without
bottled oxygen since 1978, when it was first accomplished. The death
toll of Everest climbers is believed to exceed 120.

 House Panel Backs Plan Giving Federal Workers 2 Percent Pay Raise 
 (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The House Appropriations Committee Thursday endorsed a
plan that would give federal workers a 2 percent pay raise and half of
their scheduled ``locality pay'' next year.
</P>
<P>
The pay plan, presented by Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., would provide
$1.8 billion for federal salaries next year, less than the $3.5
billion needed to fully fund federal pay but $700 million more than
recommended in President Clinton's fiscal 1995 budget.
</P>
<P>
``We don't have the money to make a better deal,'' Hoyer said in an
interview, referring to reduced spending levels caused by
deficit-reduction mandates. `` ... My position has generally been with
the federal employees, I want to see you treated fairly, which is to
say I don't want to see others in the private and public sector going
off (and winning raises) while you're squeezed. I don't think that's
fair. On the other hand, if everybody is taking a notch in on their
belt, we will join in. That's fair.''
</P>
<P>
Hoyer told the committee his compromise would create ``a net
average of 2.6 percent'' across government, the same percentage that
House panels have scheduled for members of the armed forces next year.
</P>
<P>
Federal agencies would absorb the cost of the pay increase in their
fiscal 1995 appropriations. That, Rep. Joseph M. McDade, R-Pa., said,
would likely require some agencies to lay off workers in order to stay
within their budgets.
</P>
<P>
McDade said that requiring agencies to find $700 million, given the
tightness of their budgets, ``scares the life out of me.'' He told the
commmittee that Office of Management and Budget Director Leon E.
Panetta recently advised congressional leaders that some agencies
might be forced into layoffs if required to absorb the cost of future
pay raises.
</P>
<P>
McDade offered an amendment to use unspent fiscal 1994 funds to
finance next year's pay raise, but his proposal was rejected on a
28-to-20 vote.
</P>
<P>
Hoyer said he did not believe the compromise pay plan would cause
layoffs in government ranks, but conceded it is ``difficult to tell,''
in part because Congress and the administration have mandated a
workforce reduction of 272,900 employees over six years. The
downsizing might even force agencies into layoffs, he suggested.
</P>
<P>
Hoyer's plan ensures that all civil-service workers -- white collar,
blue collar and employees on special pay schedules -- will receive at
least a 2 percent pay raise next year. His proposal also keeps
locality pay, which was opposed by the administration last year,
viable for another year.

 Pre-Dinosaur Pincer Creature Shows That Evolution Ran Fast 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A large, strange beast dug from deep in the past is showing that
evolution ran faster and produced more variety 600 million years ago
than anyone anticipated, scientists reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Dating back to the early years of the Cambrian period -- up to 400
million years before the dinosaurs -- the beast was a 6-foot-long
ocean-dwelling predator with formidable front pincers. It is roughly
reminiscent of a giant lobster.
</P>
<P>
According to the team of Chinese and Swedish researchers studying
the newest fossil evidence, found in 1990-92 in China, the beast
apparently hid in mud on the sea floor while it awaited its prey.
</P>
<P>
The new evidence is important because it ``implies that
considerable evolution took place during a time interval even shorter
than previously suspected,'' said Jun-yuan Chen, Lars Ramskold and
Gui-qing Zhou in the journal Science. Until now, it was thought such
big, predatory creatures did not exist until millions of years later.
</P>
<P>
The Cambrian period is remarkable for the rapidity with which
multicelled species appeared, following billions of years of much
slower evolution in single-cell creatures, such as algae. During the
so-called ``Cambrian explosion,'' the ancestors of all species known
today, and some that have since gone extinct, suddenly appeared.
</P>
<P>
The animal the Chinese/Swedish team studied, ``Anomalocaris,'' is
especially interesting because of its size, and because some parts
found during the past 100 years were completely misidentified. Late in
the last century, for example, leg-like appendages found in Canada's
famed Burgess shale deposit were thought to be the bodies of
shrimp-like creatures.
</P>
<P>
Worse, a jaw now known to be from Anomalocaris was listed as being
from a jellyfish.
</P>
<P>
``The unfolding story of anomalocaridids is almost as unlikely as
the animal itself,'' said geologist Derek E.G. Briggs, of Bristol
University, in England, who was not a member of the research team.
Such errors led to misinterpretations and deeper confusion.
</P>
<P>
``Although the appendages testified to a giant predator,'' Briggs
said in Science, ``the nature of the animal remained a mystery until
specimens preserving the body, with the limbs at the front of the
head, were discovered in Burgess shale material'' about 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Finally, a major fossil discovery in southern China, at Chengjian
in 1984, was explored more thoroughly from 1990 to 1992. The dig
produced remarkable animal remains from the Cambrian period,
especially because fine sediment had preserved the animals' soft,
non-boney parts.
</P>
<P>
Generally, soft tissues disappear, leaving only bones, or sometimes
parts of an external skeleton.
</P>
<P>
Briggs explained that ``just 15 years ago the Cambrian animal
Anomalocaris was little known,'' except from a few scattered, partial
remains found in North America. But because of the spectacular finds
in China ``this creature turns out to be representative of a diverse
group of giant Cambrian predators that ranged as far as Europe,
Australia and China.''
</P>
<P>
Paleontologist Andrew Knoll, at Harvard University, said
Anomalocaris has been known for a decade to be among the very few
large predators in the Cambrian period. ``Now it can be seen to have
originated earlier in the Cambrian than would have been thought on the
basis of the Burgess shale'' findings, he said.
</P>
<P>
The newest data, Knoll added, ``suggests that most of the
structural innovations among animals occurred in a very short time,
and this is one more piece of evidence.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Chen, Ramskold and Zhou explained that ``Chengjiang yielded fossils
of giant predators of three different kinds, including complete
specimens of Anomalocaris.'' Details of the animal's anatomy suggest
it could swim rapidly to capture prey. It is believed to have lasted
at least several million years.
</P>
<P>
The animals' shape also suggests ``they may have spent much time
partly buried or camouflaged in the bottom sediment, with stalked eyes
protruding over the bottom and scanning the surroundings for swimming
prey,'' the team said.
</P>
<P>
In some examples, the animal's intestinal tract can be seen,
although it was not possible to identify the content of the gut. But
the scientists suspect Anomalocaris may have preyed on primitive sea
creatures such as large trilobites. Attacks by such large predators
were ``inferred from healed injuries on trilobites.''
</P>
<P>
Fossilized dung pellets -- perhaps from Anomalocaris -- contain the
remains of trilobites and other primitive animals, and were also found
in the Chengjiang deposit.

 Watkins Resigns After He Used Military Copter for Golf Trip (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
White House administrative chief David Watkins, a
longtime aide to President Clinton who hails from his hometown of
Hope, Ark., resigned Thursday after officials learned he had taken a
military helicopter earlier in the week to rural Maryland to play
golf.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, saying he was ``very upset'' when he learned about
Watkins' trip earlier in the day, disclosed his aide's resignation
during a news conference called to announce a decision on
most-favored-nation trading status for China.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the round-trip was estimated at $5,000. Clinton
promised that the treasury will be fully reimbursed, though it was
unclear whether the money would come from Watkins or other private
sources. ``The taxpayers will be made whole,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Watkins, former head of an advertising agency in Little Rock, Ark.,
handled all the advertising for Clinton's initial gubernatorial
campaigns and was involved in his presidential campaign as well. He
also has been a co-investor with the Clintons, particularly in a
highly lucrative cellular telephone franchise. He now becomes the
latest in a series of Arkansas friends of the Clintons whose actions
have subjected the president to political embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
Watkins might have gone unscathed but for editors of the Frederick
(Md.) News-Post, who heard Tuesday that a White House helicopter was
in their back yard, at the Holly Hills Country Club, and sent a
photographer in hopes of catching a glimpse of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the paper got, and published in its Wednesday editions, a
photograph of Watkins and two other White House aides dressed in
golfing clothes and bearing their clubs walking back onto the
helicopter as Marines in full dress uniform stand by, saluting.
</P>
<P>
At the time, the paper reported that officials of the country club
had declined to identify the visitors, but when the photograph was
published, Republican staff members quickly recognized Watkins.
</P>
<P>
The other two officials were Alphonso Maldon Jr., head of the White
House military office, and Navy Cmdr. Richard Cellon, the commanding
officer at Camp David, Md., the presidential retreat that is located
not far from the country club.
</P>
<P>
By Thursday, Maryland Rep. Roscoe Bartlett, a Republican whose
district includes the golf course, picked up the issue and
congressional Republicans were in full cry, demanding hearings, an
official investigation and a full accounting of all staff use of
military aircraft.
</P>
<P>
``The photo of two Marine guards saluting a golf bag as it was
carried up the helicopter stairs is truly a picture that's worth a
thousand words,'' Bartlett said.
</P>
<P>
The golf course is about an 80-minute drive northwest of
Washington. The helicopter departed and returned from the Pentagon,
which is about a 10-minute drive south from Watkin's residence in the
Georgetown neighborhood of the capital.
</P>
<P>
At the White House, officials reacted with anger and incredulity to
Watkins' actions, which were painfully reminiscent of the misuse of
official airplanes that led to the resignation of former Bush
administration chief of staff John H. Sununu.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, mindful of the Sununu episode, had issued a directive to
White House staff early in his presidency intended to limit the
ability of senior government officials to use military transportation.
As head of the White House administrative apparatus, the task of
enforcing that directive fell to Watkins.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
The outing is the only time Watkins is known to have used military
transportation for such purposes, White House officials said.
</P>
<P>
Of the two other aides involved, Maldon has been reprimanded and
reassigned for his role, said White House press secretary Dee Dee
Myers. No action will be taken against Cellon because it has been
determined that he was not involved in the decision to use the
helicopter.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the trip Wednesday, White House deputy press secretary
Arthur Jones told The Baltimore Sun the three officials had flown to
the course to make preparations for Clinton to visit it this weekend.
Former President Bush golfed frequently at the course when staying at
Camp David.
</P>
<P>
But Thursday, Myers backed away from that account, saying Jones had
answered the question in ``good faith'' based on a written statement
from a Watkins deputy, but that ``I think we've gone beyond that
now.''

 Tagger Response to Paddle-Pushing Pol: `Spank Me' (Orange, Calif.) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ORANGE, Calif.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some people grumble at their local legislator in a
letter. Others pick up the phone to gripe.
</P>
<P>
But a disgruntled constituent of California Assemblyman Mickey
Conroy has skipped the usual routes and spray painted an opinion on
the doors of the lawmaker's district office.
</P>
<P>
The message was the work of a tagger with a sense of the sardonic.
The object of scorn was a bill Conroy introduced this week calling for
paddlings of juveniles caught scrawling graffiti. That proposal has
earned the Republican assemblyman nationwide media attention and
prompted public reaction ranging from hearty applause to outright
ridicule.
</P>
<P>
His most pointed critic was right back home in Orange County.
</P>
<P>
Conroy's staff arrived Thursday morning at the district office in
Orange to discover the words ``Spank Me'' scrawled on both office
doors by the taunting tagger.
</P>
<P>
Police were called in and promised a full investigation, but no
suspects have been apprehended. Conroy was less than amused, but did
not miss the opportunity to give his bill a boost.
</P>
<P>
``It's disgusting,'' he said in a news release distributed within
hours of the discovery. ``However, if the punks who did this think
that this is going to stop me from passing my paddle law, they've got
another thing coming. ... If these criminals want a fight, I'll give
'em one.''
</P>
<P>
Conroy would not hazard a guess who might have been behind it.
Local youths? Disgruntled Orange County Democrats? ``I don't have any
idea,'' he said Thursday. ``I'm surprised it took them this long.
We've been expecting it.''
</P>
<P>
Conroy was happy that ``at least they're aware of what I'm trying
to do,'' but lamented that it demonstrates once again ``just what the
attitude of people is today. That's why we need a little public
humiliation like that proposed in my bill.''
</P>
<P>
The legislation, which faces stiff opposition in the
Democrat-dominated California Legislature, calls for juveniles
convicted of defacing or destroying property with graffiti to be
punished by being struck as many as 10 times with a wooden paddle
wielded in court by a parent or a bailiff.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Conroy's employees weren't happy about the vandalism. The graffiti
covered the middle section of the blue-and-terra-cotta-colored doors
to the office, which is tucked in the back of a shopping mall. The
unevenly spray-painted ``Spank Me'' message also covered part of the
stucco.
</P>
<P>
``The owner of the complex is not happy,'' said Ann Conroy, the
assemblyman's wife.
</P>
<P>
But she was not surprised by the graffiti message. Indeed, she
said, ``I would think it would be a natural reaction (to my husband's
proposal). It is targeted toward vandals and I would think they would
try to retaliate.''
</P>
<P>
Graffiti, she said, is common in the area. The mall and a business
complex behind it have been constantly defaced by vandals, one of the
reasons her husband's bill has received an ``overwhelmingly positive
response'' among his constituents, she said.

 University Removes Mural Judged Anti-Semitic (San Francisco) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the dead of night early Thursday, San Francisco
State University painters escorted by riot police obliterated a
controversial mural of Malcolm X because it contained symbols
considered by university officials to be anti-Semitic.
</P>
<P>
Arguing it was not an infringement of free speech to remove emblems
of bigotry on artwork the university itself had commissioned,
President Robert A. Corrigan ordered the mural removed after student
leaders failed to take action themselves.
</P>
<P>
The mural, painted on a university building and unveiled last week,
included Stars of David inset with dollar signs -- outraging Jewish
students and highlighting ethnic divisions on the multicultural
campus.
</P>
<P>
``This university absolutely will not tolerate expressions of
hate,'' Corrigan said. ``Intolerance and prejudice are abhorrent to
our deepest values as individuals and as a community.''
</P>
<P>
Some black students fought to keep the mural, twice rescuing it
from campus paint crews before it was finally sanded off the wall of
the student union.
</P>
<P>
Defending the depiction of the assassinated leader, members of the
Pan African Student Union said the symbols were not anti-Jewish but a
reflection of Malcolm's anti-Zionist views.
</P>
<P>
``Our intentions were not to hurt anyone,'' said Troy Nkrumah, a
student who is coordinator of the Pan African Student Union. ``All art
is open to interpretation.''
</P>
<P>
But Jewish students and community members disagreed. ``This is a
state-funded university, and state funds should not be used to portray
hateful images,'' said Eloise Magenheim, a recent graduate who stood
with a protest sign near the site of the mural.
</P>
<P>
Removal of the mural raised the thorny question of whether racist
or bigoted statements are protected under the First Amendment right of
free speech.
</P>
<P>
But legal experts and scholars echoed the view of university
officials that, in this case, the constitutional right to free
expression did not apply because the mural was commissioned and paid
for by the university.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
``This is not a situation where university officials went into an
artist's studio and painted over his work,'' said Albert Elsen, a
professor of art law and art history at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Thomas Grey, a Stanford professor of constitutional law,
likened it to ``hiring someone to write a brochure about the
university and then editing what was said.
</P>
<P>
``You might not like the fact that they edited your message, but
they have the legal right to decide what picture of the university
they want to project. There's no First Amendment issue there.''
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union seconded that legal

she was disturbed by the university's conduct.
</P>
<P>
``This controversy has exposed a great deal of tension and
intolerance on campus, and it seems to me that simply painting over
the offending remarks in the dead of night is not good enough,''
Ehrlich said. ``It seems the lesson given here (by the university) is
that the way to avoid controversy is to not allow any provocative
expression.''

 California Court Allows Limits on Abortion Pickets (San Francisco) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Supreme Court, ruling for the first
time in an abortion protest case, held Thursday that demonstrators can
be barred from a public sidewalk in front of an abortion clinic to
protect patient safety.
</P>
<P>
The 6-1 decision helps assure California's abortion clinics of
legal protection if pickets threaten patients' emotional health, a
protection that could be extended to targets of other kinds of
political demonstrations as well.
</P>
<P>
``Emotionally jarring confrontations with anti-abortion pickets or
sidewalk `counselors' may pose serious health risks,'' Justice Armand
Arabian wrote for the majority.
</P>
<P>
It was the second setback for abortion protesters Thursday.
President Clinton signed legislation making it a federal crime to
block the entrance to an abortion clinic or attack those entering it.
Two anti-abortion groups immediately filed a lawsuit to nullify the
law.
</P>
<P>
The California ruling marked the first time the state's Supreme
Court has decided an abortion case since conservatives gained a
majority in 1987. The U.S. Supreme Court has a similar case pending.
</P>
<P>
Justice Joyce L. Kennard, the state court's only woman and one of
its more liberal members, dissented, contending that the buffer zone
approved by the court was broader than that endorsed by appellate
courts.
</P>
<P>
In grappling with the case, the state court called the collision
between competing constitutional interests ``the most difficult and
divisive subject of our day'' and acknowledged that its ruling would
be controversial.
</P>
<P>
But the court majority also called its decision ``manifestly
reasonable and conducive to the fostering of greater harmony in the
community.''
</P>
<P>
The ruling came in the approval of an injunction that forced
antiabortion pickets to remain across a busy, four-lane avenue from a
Planned Parenthood clinic in Vallejo, a Solano County city east of San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
The pickets had tried to dissuade women entering the clinic from
having abortions. They gave them anti-abortion literature, shoving it
into car windows as patients drove in, and on at least two occasions
tossed them plastic replicas of fetuses.
</P>
<P>
``The state's responsibility for the health and safety of women
seeking medical services, including abortions, extends beyond the
operating room,'' Arabian wrote. ``Physical or emotional intimidation
of patients outside the doctor's office may significantly affect their
course of treatment once they are inside.''
</P>
<P>
Although the case involved abortion, the decision has ramifications
for other demonstrations that limit the ``rights of private citizens
to conduct their lawful business without pain or hindrance,'' wrote
Justice Marvin Baxter, in a separate concurring opinion joined by
Justice Ronald George.
</P>
<P>
Baxter said the kinds of confrontational actions taken by the
abortion picketers ``crossed the line from protected expression to
unprotected interference with the lawful activities of other
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
John R. Streett, an attorney for Solano Citizens for Life, which
appealed the case to the high court, noted that the ruling could also
limit the ability of unions to picket.
</P>
<P>
In the abortion context, he said, the decision will ``make it very
easy'' for clinics to get injunctions to stop any protests on their
sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
``Basically all they have to allege is, `Our patients are upset by
this, they don't like it, they are crying, we feel they are
traumatized,' '' Streett said. ``That is not going to be much of a
standard at all.''
</P>
<P>
But attorneys for Planned Parenthood said courts still will have
freedom to shape injunctions according to the facts of the case,
including the configuration of the clinic and its proximity to
protesters.
</P>
<P>
The court ruling simply ``means that patients at medical clinics
have the right to be free of abuse, harassment and assault,'' said
Planned Parenthood attorney Stephen Kostka.
</P>
<P>
Christine Williams, former director of Solano Citizens for Life,
complained that the court's decision will make it ``extremely
difficult'' for anti-abortion groups to give abortion patients ``one
last chance to change their minds.''
</P>
<P>
Pickets have been congregating weekly across the street from the
Planned Parenthood clinic since a Solano County Superior Court issued
the permanent injunction in August 1991, she said.
</P>
<P>
But the protesters cannot be heard by patients through the din of
traffic, she said, and their numbers have dropped because ``people are
very discouraged by the lack of effectiveness.''
</P>
<P>
Abortion-rights advocates have been buoyed by recent victories. In
January, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously that abortion
clinics can sue protesters for damage under a federal racketeering
law.
</P>
<P>
``This seems to be part of a big wall that is coming down,'' said
Anna Runkle, spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood, Shasta-Diablo, which
runs the Vallejo clinic. ``It seems to be a landslide. The public and
the law are finally saying enough is enough.''
</P>
<P>
In her dissent, Kennard said the injunction banishing the
protesters to the opposite side of the street violated their First
Amendment rights to express their views.
</P>
<P>
Although other appellate courts cited by the majority approved of
buffer zones, Kennard said, they also allowed a limited number of
protesters within them or drew them narrowly enough to permit
protesters to communicate with patients.

 No Permanent Solution for Cold War Nuclear Waste (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Energy Department has no permanent solution for
disposing of 50 tons of radioactive plutonium waste from the Cold War
weapons program, and may have to continue using temporary storage
facilities for as long as 20 years, Energy officials told Congress
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
As an interim solution, the department is considering the
possibility of storing some of the waste in abandoned military bases
around the country, officials said in a report released earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
The disposal issue is one of the thorniest facing the department.
Plutonium poses ``significant dangers to national and international
security'' because of the possibility that it could fall into the
wrong hands and be fashioned into a nuclear bomb, Energy Under
Secretary Charles Curtis said in testimony before the Senate Energy
and Natural Resources Committee.
</P>
<P>
Only about 10 pounds of plutonium is needed to build a bomb.
</P>
<P>
Of the estimated 100 tons of weapons grade plutonium in the United
States, only half will be retained by the federal government for use
in nuclear weapons. No plans have yet been devised for disposing of
the remainder.
</P>
<P>
Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, D-La., committee chairman, said that
while the problem is a serious one for both the United States and
Russia -- which possess the bulk of the world's plutonium -- the pace of
the search for a solution has been ``torpid at best.''
</P>
<P>
In addition to solving the plutonium disposal problem, the Energy
Department also must decide what to do about the millions of pounds of
radioactive waste from other sources that is being stored in 29
temporary sites around the nation. Many of the containers are rusting
and threatening to release radioactivity. Inspection teams are now
attempting to assess the extent of the danger, an Energy spokesman
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, most of the surplus plutonium is held at relatively
few sites, the largest of which is the department's Pantex plant near
Amarillo, Texas, which has the job of dismantling nuclear weapons.
About 6,000 plutonium pits are contained in so-called igloos on Pantex
land.
</P>
<P>
The proposal to store the waste at military installations appears
to be the result of protests from Texas authorities over the storage
of the plutonium waste at Pantex.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary has promised Texas officials to
limit the storage there, raising the problem of where to put the
material.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to find a permanent storage site have run into a number of
technical and environmental roadblocks. A federally appointed panel
led by Stanford University Professor Wolfgang Panofsky suggested that
the plutonium could be used in commercial reactors to make electricity
or be converted into glass logs in a process called vitrification.
</P>
<P>
But Johnston raised concerns that the only U.S. reactors capable of
burning the plutonium are scheduled to be closed. It would take
another decade to build a new reactor for the job, Panofsky said.

 Insurance Co. Group Endorses Antitrust Exemption Reversal (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee
announced Thursday a surprising alliance with a powerful insurance
company trade group to endorse legislation curtailing insurers'
49-year special exemption from federal antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
After two years of negotiations, the American Insurance
Association, has decided to back reform, ``the first breach in the
wall of strident opposition'' from the industry, said Rep. Jack
Brooks, D-Texas. The group's membership includes some of the giant
companies of the industry, such as Aetna, Travelers, Cigna, Hartford
and Kemper, active in selling property and casualty coverage.
</P>
<P>
Under Brooks' bill, insurers will be allowed to continue sharing
information on actual historical losses. But, three years after
passage, they would no longer be allowed to engage in ``trending,'' or
sharing projections of future losses from such things as theft, fire,
floods and earthquakes. This shared information now has an important
impact on setting rates.
</P>
<P>
If Congress approves the bill, the result would be ``downward
pressure on prices and more consumer choice,'' predicted Mark
Silbergeld, Washington director for Consumers Union, which helped
Brooks and the AIA reach their agreement.
</P>
<P>
Brooks has twice moved a similar bill through his Judiciary
Committee in prior congresses, but was unable to get a vote in the
full House because of united insurance industry opposition. The task
is still difficult, but he has for the first time enlisted an
important segment of the insurance business to be his ally instead of
his enemy.
</P>
<P>
The AIA hopes that passage of the Brooks bill would defuse some of
the consumer anger against the insurance industry and make it possible
to pass other legislation eagerly sought by insurers. Removing the
special antitrust treatment ``will restore some consumer confidence
that the rates out there are fair,'' said David Pratt, the AIA's
senior vice president for federal affairs.
</P>
<P>
``It is very important for us to be a more normal industry from the
antitrust standpoint and this can create a more positive climate as we
deal with other issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
These other concerns, which the insurance industry is pushing for
separately, include proposals to:
</P>
<P>
-- Provide a settlement system for the barrage of lawsuits under the
federal Superfund, where a company hit with a cleanup sues the
insurance carrier;
</P>
<P>
-- Limit lawsuits for product liability;
</P>
<P>
-- Create a federal reinsurance fund to ease the risks of providing
coverage for natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, fires and
hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
But the rest of the industry doesn't share the AIA's belief that
giving away the antitrust privilege will lead to victory on other
issues.
</P>
<P>
``Some regional companies could go out of business, and it could do
a lot of damage to consumers,'' said Julie Rochman, vice president of
the Alliance of American Insurers, whose membership includes many
medium and smaller firms that depend on the pooled information.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
The Brooks bill is ``an effort by a very small segment of the
industry to appease opponents of the industry in Congress and some
vocal critics on the outside,'' said Jack Ramirez, executive vice
president and chief operating officer of the National Assn. of
Independent Insurers. ``No amount of tinkering with a bad bill is
going to make it any better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The major life insurance trade group also opposes any change in the
status quo, which has existed since 1945, when the insurance industry
persuaded Congress to pass the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which removed
the federal government from insurance regulation. Each of the 50
states oversees insurers operating within its borders. ``There is no
need to fix a system that isn't broken,'' said Gene Grabowski, a
spokesman for the American Council of Life Insurance. ``The state
governments have done a fine job. But the Brooks bill would allow the
federal government, through the attorney general and the Federal Trade
Commission, to get involved.''

 Clinton Signs Bill Barring Abortion Clinic Blockades (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Clinton signed legislation Thursday barring
abortion clinic blockades and harassment -- a move that extended a
recent string of victories for abortion-rights groups but brought a
pair of immediate legal challenges from their foes.
</P>
<P>
As Clinton hailed the law as a blow against ``extremism and
vigilantism,'' two anti-abortion groups filed lawsuits that could lead
to court clarification of the murky and hotly disputed boundary
between free-speech and abortion-rights laws. The groups, the American
Center for Law and Justice and the American Life League, sought
injunctions to block the new statute, which they said will curtail
their right to protest more than that of any other group.
</P>
<P>
Even as they went to court, however, abortion foes acknowledged
that the law, which becomes effective immediately, had dealt them a
severe setback. While they vowed to continue protests, officials of
some anti-abortion groups said they feared that the stiff sanctions -- 
which include fines of up to $250,000 and prison terms of six months
to life -- could curtail their ability to find volunteers to help close
down clinics.
</P>
<P>
Some openly lamented the reversals suffered by a movement that
dominated the abortion debate for much of the past decade.
</P>
<P>
``Mr. Clinton eroded in one year pro-life gains that took us 20
years of back-breaking work,'' said the Rev. Pat Mahoney, a national
leader of Operation Rescue. ``Clearly, this has been a horrible year
for the pro-life movement.''
</P>
<P>
In addition to the clinic-access law, the anti-abortion rights
groups have recently been disappointed by an agreement that will allow
U.S. tests of the abortion-pill RU 486 and by million-dollar judgments
against protesters who damaged abortion clinics.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court also ruled this year that federal prosecutors may
use the tough anti-racketeering statute in some circumstances against
protesters who sought to close down clinics. And last year the Clinton
administration lifted a order prohibiting abortion counseling in
federally-funded clinics.
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by abortion-rights advocates at a White House ceremony,
Clinton said, ``We cannot -- we must not -- continue to allow the
attacks, the incidents of arson, the campaigns of intimidation upon
law-abiding citizens that has given rise to this law.''
</P>
<P>
But he insisted that the bill ``is not a strike against the First
Amendment. Far from it. It insures that all citizens have the
opportunity to exercise all their constitutional rights, including
their privacy rights.''
</P>
<P>
Some advocates say more than 1,000 violent incidents have occurred
at clinics since 1977, including 81 cases of arson, 36 bombings, 84
assaults, two kidnappings, and the fatal shooting of Florida
abortionist Dr. David Gunn. That killing helped galvanize sentiment
against abortion-clinic violence, changing the political balance in
Congress sufficiently to deliver victory for a proposal that two years
ago died in committee.
</P>
<P>
The bill passed by 241-174 vote margin in the House, and by a 69 to
30 margin in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
``We decry violence all the time -- this was a move to stop it,''
said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who helped Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., lead the effort for the bill in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
The bill imposes its penalties on anyone who uses force, threats or
``physical obstruction'' to any person using an abortion clinic or
reproductive-health service. The bill's also states, however, that no
provision of it may interfere with free speech rights.
</P>
<P>
Abortion foes argue that since that it imposes much harsher
penalties than the one-night jail terms and $100 fines that are
typical for protest sit-ins and blockades, the law is effectively
depriving them of a tactic that other protesters have long used.

 Clinton Changes Course, Renews China's MFN Trade Status (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON - President Clinton, unabashedly changing course,
renewed China's favorable trade status Thursday and abandoned its use
as a weapon for pressuring Beijing on human rights improvement.
</P>
<P>
In a mild sanction, Clinton said the United States would ban the
import of munitions, mainly ammunition and cheap, automatic rifles
that have poured into the country, becoming a mass-market assault
weapon.
</P>
<P>
The president's decisions directly contradicted a position staked
out last year, when he demanded ``overall, significant progress'' in
China's human rights record as a condition for renewing its
most-favored-nation trade status.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged Thursday that, despite some strides, serious human
rights abuses continue in China.
</P>
<P>
While the renewal of MFN was expected, Clinton's decision to
``de-link'' trade privleges and human rights was debated as late as
Wednesday night among administration officials. ``We have reached the
end of the usefulness of that policy,'' Clinton said at a White House
briefing.
</P>
<P>
The president insisted that the United States could do more to
encourage human rights progress by expanding trade and improving
overall U.S.-Chinese relations.
</P>
<P>
The policy shift, in keeping with Clinton's focus on economics in
foreign affairs, was cheered by business leaders, Republicans and
moderate Democrats as practical and prudent. But it brought a furious
reaction from human rights activists and members of Congress who have
long advocated the use of trade sanctions to bring pressure on China
not to repress its citizens.
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine and Rep. Nancy
Pelosi, D-Calif., said they would introduce legislation to impose
trade sanctions.
</P>
<P>
``It will confirm for the Chinese Communist regime the success of
its policy of repression on human rights and manipulation on trade,''
Mitchell said of Clinton's action. Mitchell promised to introduce
legislation following the Memorial Day congressional recess.
</P>
<P>
In a stinging rebuke, AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said
Clinton's decision ``sends a clear message to the world: No matter
what America says about democracy and human rights, in the final
analysis profits, not people, matter most.''
</P>
<P>
But some influential Democrats, including Sen. Bill Bradley of New
Jersey and Rep. Lee Hamilton of Indiana, who chairs the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, had urged the president to drop the linkage between
trade and human rights.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was under heavy pressure by U.S. companies to renew MFN
status with China, which allows Chinese goods into the United States
under low tariffs. Business executives feared that revocation would
trigger a trade war, cutting U.S. companies and investors out of the
world's fastest-growing market. U.S. businesses export $8 billion in
goods to China, underwriting more than 150,000 jobs in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The potential damage to U.S. interests from a trade war was
highlighted Thursday with reports that China had agreed to a $5
billion Boeing Aircraft deal.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
More surprising was the president's frank conclusion that his
year-old policy had not worked and that it was time to switch. In
doing so, he adopted some of the reasoning put forward by former
President Bush, whose policy toward China Clinton had sharply
criticized during their 1992 campaign.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said more could be gained by engaging the Chinese than by
isolating them. He also argued that culturally, it is difficult for
China, the world's most populous nation, with 1.2 billion people, to
appear to be buckling to pressure from the United States.
</P>
<P>
``We need to place our relationship into a larger and more
productive framework,'' he said in a statement. ``I think we have to
see our relations with China within the broader context of our
policies within the Pacific-Asian region.''
</P>
<P>
In May 1993, working with Mitchell and others in Congress, Clinton
issued an executive order that gave China a year to make specific
strides in its human rights record or face the end of its MFN status
this June.
</P>
<P>
The order set two conditions that Clinton said had been met:
removing emigration restrictions and complying with a U.S.-China
agreement on exports of goods made with prison labor.
</P>
<P>
But the order also required the secretary of state to determine, in
making a recommendation, whether China had made ``overall, significant
progress'' in five other areas. These included adherence to the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights; releasing and accounting for
political prisoners; ensuring humane treatment of prisoners;
protecting Tibet's religious and cultural heritage, and permitting
international radio and TV broadcasts into China.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Warren M. Christopher ``has reached a conclusion
with which I agree, that the Chinese did not achieve overall
significant progress in all the areas outlined in the executive order
relating to human rights, even though clearly there was progress made
in important areas,'' Clinton said.

 Further Documents Show Mrs. Clinton's Trading Was Legal (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The White House released additional records Thursday
related to first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's commodities trading
activities, in further efforts to show she did nothing illegal or
unethical in making her investments.
</P>
<P>
The White House also issued a brief analysis by a commodities
expert who was asked by the Clintons to review her trading, in which
he found that she ``violated no rules in the course of her
transactions.''
</P>
<P>
Leo Melamed, former chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
one of the nation's largest commodities exchanges, noted in a
statement that the new records released by Mrs. Clinton confirms his
assessment that she broke no rules. The new data from the Chicago
exchange ``largely confirms and also complements'' records from Mrs.
Clinton's brokerage account released last month by the White House, he
said.
</P>
<P>
``These records are being released today in order to give as
complete a picture as possible of Mrs. Clinton's trading,'' said Lisa
Caputo, Mrs. Clinton's press secretary.
</P>
<P>
Caputo said the records were not released earlier because Mrs.
Clinton had not known of their existence at the Chicago exchange.
Caputo said the new records corroborate those released by Mrs. Clinton
last month from her brokerage account at the REFCO commodities
brokerage firm, where she invested beginning in 1978.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the new records confirm, Melamed's review stated,
that the first lady did not violate the rules in her first, and
perhaps most controversial commodities trade, in which she turned a
$1,000 investment into $6,300 overnight.
</P>
<P>
Melamed said the records provide more detailed information about
Mrs. Clinton's first day of trading than was available from the
earlier records. They show, he said, that Mrs. Clinton had risked her
money in the transaction, demonstrating that it was a legitimate
investment and not some form of favorable insider transaction arranged
by her broker.
</P>
<P>
In that one trade, Mrs. Clinton sold 10 December live cattle
contracts Oct. 11, 1978, at the price of $57.55 a pound, and offset
this trade with a purchase of 10 December live cattle contracts Oct.
12, 1978 at the price of $56.10 a pound for a profit of $5,300, after
commissions.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
He noted while Mrs. Clinton did not have enough margin, or reserves
in her account to cover her exposure in the trade, that ``does not
represent a rule violation by the customer. Rather, it is an issue
between the clearing firm and the exchange.'' His statement is
consistent with the White House's previous assertions that if there
was any such rule violations, they were the fault of her broker, and
not Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Melamed said some records from the exchange concerning Mrs.
Clinton's trading activity were either missing or incomplete, which
may have been caused by REFCO's practice of conducting ``batch
reporting'' of trades. ``To an extent the firm handling Mrs. Clinton's
account was penalized by the exchange for allegedly utilizing some of
these procedures improperly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Critics have said such batch trading was prevalent at the REFCO
brokerage office in Springdale, Ark., where Mrs. Clinton traded, and
that her broker allocated winning trades from those larger blocks to
favored customers. Melamed said such batch trading was ``more
prevalent in the less-regulated environment of 15 years ago.''

 Clinton Renews China's Favorable Trading Status (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Abandoning a course set a year ago, President Clinton
Thursday renewed China's preferential trading status even though he
said Beijing had failed to curb human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
Clinton cited both strategic and economic reasons for not breaking
commercial ties with the world's most populous nation, but found
himself initiating a policy close to one he had denounced and called
inadequate to end repression in China.
</P>
<P>
``I am moving to delink human rights from the annual extension of
most-favored-nation trading status for China,'' he said, because ``we
have reached the end of the usefulness of that policy, and it is time
to take a new path.''
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited announcement cheered the international business
community, which had lobbied hard for renewal of China's MFN status,
but disappointed key congressional allies who had favored tough trade
sanctions on China. Human rights groups also slammed Clinton's
announcement, saying it left the United States with little leverage to
improve conditions in China.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate comment from the Chinese government about
Clinton's announcement, which was made early Friday Beijing time. But
Thursday a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Wu Jianmin, said at his weekly
press briefing that ``The Chinese side does not accept attaching any
conditions'' to the MFN trade benefits. ``Extending MFN is in the
interests of China and the United States.''
</P>
<P>
Clinton insisted he was not giving up on improving human rights in
China, and in fact did ban importation of about $200 million in annual
shipments of Chinese weapons and ammunition to indicate his
displeasure with China's human rights record. He also continued some
sanctions put in place after the Chinese government crushed the
pro-democracy demonstrations five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Yet just a year ago, Clinton issued an executive order insisting
that renewal of MFN status would come only with significant progress
in human rights by the Chinese leadership. Clinton said Thursday that
China had met two mandatory conditions of the order -- relating to
immigration and importation of products made by prision labor -- but
had failed make progress on other provisions.
</P>
<P>
During the presidential campaign in 1992, Clinton repeatedly
accused then-President Bush of ``coddling'' the Chinese government by
allowing MFN status without demanding improvements in human rights.
</P>
<P>
In essence, experts said, Clinton Thursday virtually adopted the
former Bush policy, just as he has with such global hotspots in Bosnia
and Haiti. Clinton, however, argued that conditions had changed, and
thus ``we are far more likely to have human rights advance when it is
not under the cloud of annual review of MFN.''
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, who usually
supports Clinton, said he disagreed with the decision. ``It will
confirm for the Chinese Communist regime the success of its policy of
repression on human rights and manipulation on trade,'' he said.
Mitchell said he will introduce legislation seeking additional
sanctions, but most political experts expect Clinton to prevail in any
fight with Congress.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Clinton frequently noted that many other members of
Congress have changed their minds on the issue as well.
</P>
<P>
Most-favored-nation status means that Chinese goods will continue
to be shipped to the United States with low tariffs. All but eight
countries have MFN trading status, and its loss would have raised
tariffs on Chinese products such as shoes and toys as much as tenfold.
</P>
<P>
Trade with China now runs about $40 billion a year, but all but $9
billion of that are imports from China, the U.S. Commerce Department
says. In fact, 40 percent of all the toys sold in America are made in
China. But some American companies, especially aerospace concerns,
truck manufacturers and telecommunications companies, have experienced
significant growth in sales to China in recent years. Trade with China
now supports about 150,000 U.S. jobs, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Secretary Ron Brown said Thursday, ``China is going to be
spending $600 billion on infrastructure projects between now and the
year 2000. We'd like American companies to participate in that.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the business community, salivating over the prospect of 1.2
billion Chinese buying U.S. products, had lobbied the Clinton
administration and Capitol Hill with increasing intensity to break the
link between trade status and human rights.
</P>
<P>
``For many of our principal industries, the preservation of
most-favored-nation for China has been the No. 1 priority this year,''
said Calman Cohen, vice president of the Emergency Committee of
American Trade, a coalition of American companies actively involved in
the debate.
</P>
<P>
``The business lobbying has been unprecedented,'' said Richard
Dicker, associate counsel for Human Rights Watch/Asia, which opposed
renewal of MFN status and heavily cricized Clinton's decision.
</P>
<P>
In a White House briefing after the president's appearance,
national security adviser Anthony Lake disclosed that Clinton had
decided ``some weeks ago,'' even before he had the verdict on China's
human rights record, to stop holding the issue of trade over Beijing's
head.
</P>
<P>
The reason? The president had decided that while the Chinese record
on human rights remained poor, the administration had ``a very
important strategic objective,'' Lake said, ``building a long-term
relationship'' with the largest and potentially the richest and most
powerful nation in Asia -- which is where the president sees the U.S.
economic future.

 Aide Resigns After Using Presidential Copter for Personal Use(Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A senior White House administrator who took a
presidential helicopter to play golf at a county club during work
hours resigned Thursday under pressure from an angry President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
In announcing the departure of David Watkins, Clinton said at a
late afternoon news conference that he was ``very upset'' about the
Tuesday afternoon helicopter-and-golf incident. Clinton said Watkins
will fully reimburse the government for his personal use of the Marine
aircraft, which a Pentagon source said costs $2,380 an hour to
operate.
</P>
<P>
``Mr. Watkins offered his resignation, and I insisted that the
taxpayers be reimbursed,'' a visibly perturbed Clinton said. ``Some
way or another they will be, and we'll tell you how when we do it.''
</P>
<P>
Clinton said ``the most important thing to me'' is that ``the
Treasury will not be out one red cent for anything that happened
there.''
</P>
<P>
Watkins, 52, a businessman and longtime Clinton friend from
Arkansas, was assistant to the president for administration and
management, responsible for White House security, military liaison and
other functions.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, presidential press secretary Dee Dee Myers
announced that Clinton had ordered White House chief of staff Thomas
``Mack'' McLarty to investigate the outing at Holly Hills Country Club
at Ijamsville, Md., 45 miles north of Washington, near Camp David.
</P>
<P>
McLarty was probing whether Watkins violated a 1993 Clinton
executive order on use of government aircraft. Clinton promulgated the
policy in light of former President Bush's firing of White House chief
of staff John Sununu for repeatedly treating taxpayer-paid air travel
as a personal perk.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
``This is something we take very seriously,'' Myers said.
</P>
<P>
McLarty conferred with Watkins on the matter as Clinton was taking
Republican flak over news reports of the helicopter ride. On the House
floor and in a letter to Clinton Thursday, Rep. Roscoe Bartlett,
R-Md., who represents the region surrounding Camp David, admonished
the administration over the ``improper appearance of this trip.''
</P>
<P>
An aide to House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., gave reporters
copies of a Frederick, Md., News-Post photograph published Wednesday
of three golfers boarding the Marine helicopter at the golf course.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
White House officials said Watkins flew to the country club with
Alphonso Maldon Jr., head of the White House military office, and Navy
Cmdr. Richard Cellon, Camp David's commanding officer. Whether
Watkins' companions will be disciplined was not immediately disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Bush played regularly at Holly Hills. A deputy White House press
secretary said Wednesday that the Watkins party was scouting the club
for possible play there by Clinton during a future stay at Camp David,
which has no golf course. But Myers withdrew that explanation Thursday
and said Clinton has no known plans to golf at Holly Hills.
</P>
<P>
McLarty co-authored an internal report last year officially
reprimanding Watkins for his role in the controversial firing of seven
White House travel office employees, five of whom later were
reinstated in other government jobs. The report also faulted McLarty
for the handling of the dismissals. McLarty and Watkins have been
Arkansas friends of long standing.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Watkins, a Little Rock management consultant who lists his net
worth on a federal disclosure form at up to $1.7 million, had been a
business partner of first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. Hillary Clinton
netted $46,000 on a $2,000 investment in a Watkins cellular-phone
venture.
</P>
<P>
Watkins wasn't always successful as an entrepreneur. Business Week
magazine two weeks ago described Watkins as a dealmaker who ``has left
a trail of disappointed investors'' in ``failed penny-stock companies
from New York to Texas, hawking items from cruises to credit cards.''
Watkins later defended his business dealings as honorable.

 Pearl Harbor Not Included in Japanese Royalty's U.S. Tour (Tokyo) 
 By Sam Jameson 
 (c) 1994, Los Angeles Times 
</P>
<P>
TOKYO, May 27 -- Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko will not visit
Pearl Harbor but will pay respects to American war dead at two other
sites during a 17-day tour of the United States beginning June 10, the
Japanese government announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
The trip will be only the second by an emperor to the United States
 -- and the first in 19 years.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry diplomats initially had urged the emperor to visit
Pearl Harbor, but fears of repercussions at home from a visit to the
memorial to the battleship Arizona -- what many Americans regard as the
symbol of Japan's ``sneak attack'' on Dec. 7, 1941 -- finally killed
the proposal.
</P>
<P>
The couple will instead visit the Punch Bowl cemetery in Honolulu
and Arlington National Cemetery in Washington.
</P>
<P>
``If the emperor visited the Arizona memorial, some (Japanese)
would argue that the emperor was being used for political purposes,''
said a high Foreign Ministry diplomat who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
As ``a symbol of the unity of the Japanese people'' under the
postwar constitution, the emperor takes overseas trips only ``for the
purpose of promoting good will and friendship,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
Japan has lived in peace for 49 years since the end of World War
II, but it has never apologized outright to its war victims.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. visit by Akihito, 60, and Michiko, 59, underscores the
changes that have slowly enveloped the imperial family since the end
of the war. Until the late Emperor Hirohito made a trip to Europe as
crown prince in 1921 and retraced his steps as emperor 50 years later,
none of his 123 predecessors had ever left Japan.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Akihito, tutored in English as a student, and Michiko,
the first commoner ever to marry an emperor after a courtship that
began on a tennis court, traveled abroad frequently as crown prince
and princess.
</P>
<P>
Including two stopovers, Akihito has visited the United States four
times. One was a trip in 1960 when he visited Pearl Harbor before the
memorial to the battleship Arizona and its crew was built.
</P>
<P>
During the June trip, the imperial couple will visit 11 cities -- 
including Atlanta, Washington, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Honolulu
 -- before returning to Tokyo on June 26.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Only nine days ago, Michiko delivered a public speech for the first
time since she collapsed Oct. 20 and lost her voice. The Imperial
Household Agency said she had recovered to the point at which she has
``almost no trouble'' carrying on daily conversations.
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles area, the imperial couple is scheduled to visit
the Huntington Library and Art Collections, a Japan-America museum and
a retirement home for Americans of Japanese origin, and meet former
President Reagan and his wife, Nancy.
</P>
<P>
In Atlanta, Akihito and Michiko will meet former President Carter
and his wife, Rosalynn, and Coretta Scott King, the widow of Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
Unlike Hirohito and the former Empress Nagako, the couple will not
visit Disneyland. But they are scheduled to go to a baseball game in
St. Louis between the Cardinals and the Pittsburgh Pirates.

 Data Indicate Economic Gains Are Sustainable (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recent economic statistics paint a picture of an
economy growing in a moderate, sustainable fashion -- a picture that
should calm fears in financial markets that fast growth is about to
trigger a new burst of inflation, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
Worries that the economy might overheat were a major factor in
driving up long-term interest rates this year as investors sought
higher returns to protect themselves against a possible rise in
inflation.
</P>
<P>
If those fears are allayed, long-term rates should retrace part of
their upward track, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, analysts had predicted that growth would jump to a 4.5
percent or 5 percent annual rate in the three months from April
through June, with some economists using numbers as high as 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
But with the quarter half over, the flow of statistics on initial
claims for jobless benefits, retail sales, automobile production,
housing starts and new orders for long-lasting goods all suggest that
the economy is expanding at a solid but more moderate pace of 3.5
percent to 4 percent, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Friday, the Commerce Department will release its first revision of
growth in the first three months of the year, when the economy was
slowed by bitter winter weather in the east and a severe earthquake in
the west.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the government, using incomplete and preliminary data,
estimated first-quarter growth at 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Most analysts expect the rate to be lowered by a quarter- to a
half-percentage point. That, along with Thursday's report from the
Labor Department that the number of workers filing initial claims for
unemployment benefits is rising, is likely to figure prominently when
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan testifies before the
Senate Banking Committee.
</P>
<P>
Some committee Democrats, concerned that increases in short-term
interest rates engineered this year by the Fed are damaging the
economy, plan to ask Greenspan to justify the rate hikes.
</P>
<P>
In its report, the Labor Department said that an average of 366,750
people a week have filed initial claims for unemployment claims
benefits during the past four weeks. That is the highest since
February of last year, except for a few weeks last winter when the bad
weather was putting people out of work.
</P>
<P>
``Recent evidence suggests that job growth is about to slow from
the sharp gains posted during the past several months,'' said Bruce
Steinberg, macroeconomics manager for Merrill Lynch Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
The job market still is improving ``but the pace of improvement is
slowing to a more sustainable rate of gain,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The Merrill Lynch forecast currents pegs the second-quarter rise in
the gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation, at 3.5 percent to
4 percent.
</P>
<P>
David C. Munro, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in
New York, has a similar outlook.
</P>
<P>
``With auto output slowing after February, I look for only a 3.5
percent second-quarter GDP growth rate,'' he said. ``The first-half
average will be only 2.75 percent.''
</P>
<P>
Steinberg, Munro and many other analysts predict growth in the
second half of the year will run at about a 3 percent rate or perhaps
a little less.

 Clinton Decides to `Delink' China's Trade Status From Rights (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Clinton, abandoning a central foreign policy
principle of his administration, announced Thursday that he has
decided to ``delink'' China's privileged trading status from its human
rights record.
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that China ``continues to commit very serious
human rights abuses,'' Clinton said he has come to believe that
broader American strategic interests justify the policy reversal.
</P>
<P>
Striking a defensive, almost apologetic posture at a late afternoon
White House briefing, Clinton acknowledged that his previous approach
to U.S.-China relations had failed and said he intended to set a new
course.
</P>
<P>
``That linkage has been constructive during the past year, but I
believe, based on our aggressive contacts with the Chinese in the past
several months, that we have reached the end of the usefulness of that
policy, and it is time to take a new path toward the achievement of
our constant objectives,'' Clinton said. ``We need to place our
relationship into a larger and more productive framework.''
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Clinton said, he will renew China's most favored nation
status, meaning that China can ship its exports to the United States
on the same tariff terms as most other American trading partners.
</P>
<P>
Last year China exported about $31 billion worth of goods to the
United States, running a trade surplus of $23 billion. The United
States exported $8 billion in goods to China.
</P>
<P>
The only limitation Clinton imposed on the China trade was a ban on
U.S. sales of Chinese-made guns and ammunition, which amounted to
roughly $100 million in sales last year.
</P>
<P>
Clinton dropped the idea of forming a human rights commission to
monitor progress in China. The Chinese rejected such a body as an
insult to its sovereignty and human rights groups derided it as likely
to be ineffective.
</P>
<P>
The president announced his new China policy in the White House
briefing room. Unlike previous major presidential announcements, he
appeared alone, without Secretary of State Warren Christopher or
senior White House aides.
</P>
<P>
Clinton seemed prepared to take the inevitable criticism his change
in course generated. From Capitol Hill to human rights organizations
to Chinese dissident groups came immediate expressions of anger and
dismay.
</P>
<P>
Human Rights Watch/Asia called the Clinton announcement ``one more
capitulation on human rights.''
</P>
<P>
``Clinton has left his administration looking vacillating and
hypocritical, while the Chinese leadership, by contrast, has emerged
as hard-nosed, uncompromising and victorious. We're deeply
disappointed by this decision,'' said Sidney Jones, executive director
of the organization.
</P>
<P>
AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland, in a particularly scathing
statement, said Clinton's decision ``sends a clear message to the
world: ``No matter what America says about democracy and human rights,
in the final analysis profits, not people, matter most. ... America
should be standing with the Chinese people not their oppressors.''
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, an important ally
of the president's on health care and other major policy initiatives,
also quickly criticized Clinton's new China policy.
</P>
<P>
``I disagree with the decision. ... The experience of recent years
has been that each concession to the Chinese Communist regime
encourages its intransigence and I believe this will be the
unfortunate result of this decision,'' Mitchell said. ``It will
confirm for the Chinese Communist regime the success of its policy of
repression on human rights and manipulation on trade. It is likely to
produce a result that is the opposite of what the president intends.''
</P>
<P>
Mitchell added that when Congress returns from its Memorial Day
recess he will introduce legislation to reverse Clinton's decision.
That legislation probably will be similar to bills sponsored by
Mitchell and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., during the Bush
administration, attaching conditions to future renewals of China's
trade status.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Bush repeatedly vetoed such legislation, and, in 1992, Clinton
accused him of ``coddling dictators'' in China. During his
presidential campaign, Clinton also specifically endorsed the idea of
imposing human rights conditions on the renewal of China's trade
benefits.
</P>
<P>
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., defended the decision on policy grounds
but accused Clinton of adopting precisely the Bush administration
policy that he assailed as cynical during the 1992 campaign. Renewing
most favored nation status for China ``is a sound, if politically
embarrassing, decision,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he believed he had reached the right decision and said
he was prepared to defend it against his critics.
</P>
<P>
``I want to make it clear to you I do not do this with rose-colored
glasses on,'' Clinton said. ``I know there will be, no matter which
approach we take ... continuing human rights problems.''

 Chicago's Mail Service is Nothing to Write Home About (Chicago) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mail here has lately seemed defiant of the laws that
govern time and space.
</P>
<P>
Recent bill payments disappear into the void while bank statements
from 1988 suddenly show up.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of undelivered letters have been discovered in
the oddest spots: smoldering under a railroad viaduct, rotting in a
field, in the trunk of a postal carrier's truck, stockpiled in a
mailman's suburban condo.
</P>
<P>
Three times last week, people opened collection boxes around town
only to be greeted by smoke streaming from the slots.
</P>
<P>
``Somebody doesn't want the mail to be delivered,'' said Mark
Szumny, rolling his eyes heavenward for clues while his daughters, one
6 years old, one 5, jumped rope on the sidewalk on a waning afternoon.
The girls at play reminded him of something. An old friend of his
wife's sent cash when each was born. The money has yet to arrive.
</P>
<P>
Since the dawn of the U.S. postal system, tales of astounding
mishaps and misroutings have become part of American folklore. But
those were isolated instances. Not so in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
While Chicago may have slipped from Second City to third, it ranks
highest on the Mail Misery index. A recent postal survey found
customers more unhappy with service in this city than anywhere else in
the nation. The satisfaction rating stands at 69 percent. The
next-most troubled city, New York, scored 76 percent.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-seven postal wizards from around the country were imported
in March to figure out what's wrong here. Three top managers were
transferred out this month. Next week, supervisors and window clerks
are scheduled to take training courses, and in coming months, each
station is supposed to recruit a citizens advisory council.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Postal Service takes the uproar seriously, said Rufus F.
Porter, interim postmaster for Chicago. About 1,500 early retirements
in 1992 and this year's severe winter took their toll, he said. But
mostly, he added, ``it's a matter of bad work habits on the part of
our employees. It is embedded in the culture ... and that was a direct
result of management inattention.''
</P>
<P>
The locals, some of whom have been complaining for nearly a decade,
remain pessimistic. ``The post office has not reached out to private
consultants. It is still trying to use its own people,'' said Chicago
Alderman Mary Ann Smith. ``They've had shake-ups before but every time
things -- as we say in this office -- returned to abnormal.''
</P>
<P>
Each day, the postal service is blamed for something else, from the
lack of an audience for the Bozo TV show -- hardly anyone got tickets -- 
to the decision of a mail-order cosmetics firm to move out to the
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the sizable Polish community report with fury that their
letters to the homeland are ransacked frequently for cash.
</P>
<P>
Smith fumes. ``We're not asking them to cure cancer,'' she said.
``We're not asking them to build pyramids. We're asking them to move
pieces of paper from one place to another.''
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
The first report from the postal task force, released earlier this
month, found the worst problems at five northside, lakefront post
offices where 40 percent of the mail faced delays. Service there is
already improving, the troubleshooters said.
</P>
<P>
Those zip codes, however, are by no means the only ones that need
help.
</P>
<P>
David J. Craven, a 35-year-old attorney in the downtown Loop,
specializes in customs and international trade law, but he also has
become a reluctant connoisseur of postal blunders.
</P>
<P>
He has noticed spotty deliveries since 1991, but by January and
February, the quality of service had deteriorated dramatically.
</P>
<P>
On March 3, for the first time in its seven-year history, his
office received no mail at all. Craven was waiting for a U.S. Customs
opinion in a $5 million case.
</P>
<P>
He checked with another law firm on the 20th floor. Also no mail.
</P>
<P>
Craven telephoned the post office. When he got no satisfactory
response, he took another tack. He wrote a letter.
</P>
<P>
Four days later, the written complaint was returned to its sender.
The address of the central post office -- 433 W. Van Buren -- was
scratched out. The envelope was stamped ``NO SUCH ADDRESS.''
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
In Chicago's leafy Belmont-Cragin section, the brick bungalows and
two-flats are filled with working-class families trading postal horror
tales, fueled by the knowledge that 40,000 pieces of their mail turned
up last month at their carrier's house. Firefighters found it when
they answered an emergency call.
</P>
<P>
Along the route, Diane Gaertner had missed two of the paychecks
that her employer, an air-conditioning and heating company, sent to
her apartment. ``It affects my life when I live from check to check
and I've got a son to raise,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
The carrier, Robert Beverly, is suspected of having sifted through
the mail for items he could sell or otherwise turn to profit, Porter
said. He has been charged with felony theft.
</P>
<P>
Beverly used his own car, an older Jaguar, on his route, which made
hauling the stacks home that much easier. The Chicago district just
doesn't have enough vehicles to supply one to every employee.
</P>
<P>
But his replacement, Eddie Ponce, had a regulation truck the other
day. ``They told me, `Keep it clean,' '' she said, when they assigned
her to the route.

 CBS Defends Itself in Wake of Fox Attack 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The May ratings sweeps rundown conducted by CBS research boss David
Poltrack one morning each spring usually draws only reporters looking
for a late breakfast.
</P>
<P>
Thursday in Manhattan, three days after the
Fox-is-snatching-eight-CBS-affiliates bombshell, the annual Poltrack
Spinorama was jammed by members of the news media (``even Time
magazine showed up!'' exclaimed a CBS spokeswoman) hoping for some
nugget from CBS executives. They got a few.
</P>
<P>
CBS/Broadcast Group president Howard Stringer was on hand to
staunchly defend broadcasting in general and CBS in particular -- which
after all did cinch the primetime ratings crown for the third year in
a row last month and enjoyed what Stringer called ``the most
profitable season in history -- don't knock it.
</P>
<P>
``Programming,'' said Stringer, ``is what dominates broadcasting
and we've always been the champions. You can be a telephone company,
you can be a cable company, but in the end the quality of the original
programming is what drives everything, and we have the best.''
</P>
<P>
He reminded reporters that ``in Louisville (the people) who ran the
CBS affiliate there some years ago decided in their wisdom to go to
ABC... they switched and we switched to UHF.. and we are in first
place with that UHF station. Because, luckily, our audience has a high
school education and they can find programs.
</P>
<P>
``They're going to find our programming because it's singular and
distinctive and that strategy has worked.''
</P>
<P>
George Schweitzer, executive vice president of marketing and
communications for the Broadcast Group, promised that ``the network
plans aggressive marketing campaigns in those markets affected . . .
so that people will know where to find their (CBS) programs.''
</P>
<P>
(Five CBS affiliates -- in Detroit, Atlanta, Cleveland, Tampa-St.
Petersburg and Milwaukee -- will move to Fox by late fall).
</P>
<P>
And each reporter was given a copy of a letter from CBS Television
Network president Peter A. Lund, dispatched to advertisers and
agencies, promising that ``CBS will maintain its coverage in every
single market. We expect to maintain our circulation as well. As you
may know, many of these (defecting) stations were underperforming the
network average and frequently pre-empted our schedule. We project
these changes will have no impact on our 1994-95 schedule.''
</P>
<P>
The word on the street in New York is that initially CBS is
targeting ABC and NBC affiliates in Detroit, Atlanta and Dallas (where
another potential New World CBS affiliate will switch to Fox sometime
next year) in its drive to recover from the Fox attack . .

 What Kind of Welcome Awaits Exiled Solzhenitsyn? (Moscow) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a remarkable letter written in 1973 to a Soviet
leadership that was preparing to arrest and expel him, Alexander
Solzhenitsyn concluded with a bold declaration of independence that
must have seemed hopelessly quixotic to those who received it.
</P>
<P>
``I long ago grew out of your shell,'' he told the absolute masters
of one-sixth of the world's territory. ``The things I write will be
printed regardless of your permission. I am ready to lay down my
life.''
</P>
<P>
A few months later, ``The Gulag Archipelago,'' Solzhenitsyn's
devastating compilation of the horrors of Soviet repression, was
circulating throughout the Western world -- and the author was a
stateless exile, stripped of his Soviet citizenship and deported to
West Germany.
</P>
<P>
Friday that long exile comes to an end as the famous writer and his
family arrive in Vladivostok in the Russian Far East after a two-day
journey from Cavendish, Vt., where he spent all but two of his 20
years of banishment in the West.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Anchorage, Alaska, moments before he boarded an Alaska
Airlines plane that would fly him back home, the 75-year-old writer
praised Cavendish. With his son Stephan, 20, translating, Solzhenitsyn
said: ``This was the most creative period in my life and the most
productive period in my life.''
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped to participate in a rebirth of Russia comparable
to what occurred in Germany after the fall of the Third Reich, when a
``spiritual and moral'' recovery helped heal the wartime legacy. ``In
the U.S.S.R., none of this has happened at all,'' he said. ``The
atmosphere remains heavily stained with communism.''
</P>
<P>
Solzhenitsyn plans to deliver some remarks in Vladivostok's town
square and spend a few days meeting with members of the community.
Then he intends to set off for Moscow on a train journey across the
vast breadth of Russia in order to reacquaint himself with his native
country.
</P>
<P>
He will find that much has changed, and not all of it to his
liking. The Marxist system that Solzhenitsyn castigated in his 1973
letter as a ``dark un-Russian whirlwind'' has collapsed, along with
the Soviet empire that he described as a liability and a burden for
his native land. But they have been replaced by a raw and ragged
society of extreme contrasts between rich and poor, increasingly awash
in the Western pop culture that Solzhenitsyn repeatedly condemned
during his exile.
</P>
<P>
The writer's many statements, issued through family members, that
he intends to play no official or political role upon his arrival has
not prevented a lively and at times rancorous debate among Russian
intellectuals over the impact of his return.
</P>
<P>
``Numerous representatives of the Moscow political intelligentsia
are tearing at each other's throats regarding Solzhenitsyn,''
commentator Mikhail Leontiev wrote in Thursday's issue of the Moscow
newspaper Sevodnya. ``It turns out that, irrespective of anyone's
likes or dislikes, Russia needs Solzhenitsyn. ... It needs a national
hero, rather than a political leader. Whether he lives up to this
calling or not, time will tell. But there's no one else in Russia at
the moment.''
</P>
<P>
Leontiev and many others see Solzhenitsyn as an uncorrupted
truth-teller who can fill the moral vacuum that has existed in Russia
since the death of human rights activist Andrei Sakharov in 1989.
</P>
<P>
But others -- especially the newly ascendent nationalists who lament
the loss of the Soviet empire -- dismiss Solzhenitsyn as an irrelevant
figure from a bygone era.
</P>
<P>
``Solzhenitsyn is returning to a country which he no longer knows
... and which no longer knows him,'' said Shamil Sultanov, deputy
editor of Zavtra, a stridently ultranationalist newspaper that has
become a rallying point for opponents of the current government.
``Solzhenitsyn was a fetish of Western intellectuals and certain
political circles. ... If you go to Ryazan or Smolensk and ask people
on the street who Solzhenitsyn is, 80 out of 100 won't know.''
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
The writer's impending return has even touched off an outbreak of
what might be called Gulag denial syndrome -- an attempt by some
politicians and intellectuals to assert that the machinery of
repression chronicled by Solzhenitsyn either never existed or was far
less severe than he portrayed it.
</P>
<P>
``When he wrote `Gulag' he didn't have a single archival document
in his hands, but now they teach Russian history according to
Solzhenitsyn,'' said Alexander Nevzorov, a TV journalist turned
ultranationalist politician.
</P>
<P>
``No one would take it into their heads to teach French history
according to Dumas,'' he said. ``He is nothing more than a common
writer, a storyteller. To me, Solzhenitsyn is no one.''
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
In Vladivostok Thursday, preparations for the exile's return were
decidedly low-key, and an informal sampling of public opinion in of
the city revealed no great interest in Solzhenitsyn -- and some
confusion about his identity. One man had the writer mixed up with
Sakharov, while another was under the impression he was the director
of a popular but trivial Soviet-era movie.

 Security Fence To Be Erected for Soccer Matches (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Resisting pressure from World Cup organizers, District
of Columbia Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly decided Thursday to heed the
advice of her police commanders and install a security fence around
the field of Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium for soccer matches
there this summer.
</P>
<P>
Kelly and D.C. Police Chief Fred Thomas informed World Cup
officials during an hourlong meeting Thursday that they saw no better
alternative than the six-foot-high metal fence to prevent potentially
rowdy soccer fans from charging the field. In recent weeks, the fence
has become a sharp point of contention between the city and soccer
promoters, who have worried that it could tarnish the sport's image as
it is showcased in the United States for the first time.
</P>
<P>
World Cup organizers have tried to convince the District that a
barrier was unnecessary and could cause more safety problems than it
solved. The national director of the World Cup organizing committee,
Alan Rothenberg, who only days ago said he was confident there would
not be a fence at RFK, attended Thursday's meeting with Kelly. But the
mayor was unswayed. She was not available for comment, but said in a
statement that she supported the fence because ``the safety and
security of fans, participants and the public has always been our
overriding concern.''
</P>
<P>
Soccer officials were disappointed with Kelly's decision, but said
they did not believe it would adversely affect other World Cup
preparations. ``I do disagree on this,'' Rothenberg said. ``I think
they city (officials) are being unduly swayed by looking at the worst
examples of soccer violence. . . . There has never been those kind of
ugly incidents at World Cup matches.''
</P>
<P>
The District will be one of only three cities in the country to use
a fence for security during World Cup matches, which begin here June
19. Soccer officials have dissuaded the six other cities that are
sites for matches from using a fence. They are still in talks with
Dallas about a fence at the Cotton Bowl. The stadium at Stanford
University has a permanent fence in place.
</P>
<P>
Security has emerged as one of the leading elements of the city's
preparation for the World Cup, which is the most watched sporting
event on the planet. Thousands of fans from overseas are expected to
travel to Washington for the five matches at RFK, and law enforcement
officials fear that some of them could be troublemakers. District
police are planning to deploy more than 1,000 officers in various
roles for World Cup events.
</P>
<P>
District police, who have traveled overseas to study security
measures at soccer matches, say the fence will be the easiest way to
contain an unruly crowd. It also will be much cheaper than putting
scores of extra officers, at overtime pay, on the field during the
matches. The fence costs $25,000 and will be paid for by a grant from
the Department of Defense, police officials said.

 Clinton Decision on China Trade Status Is Sharp Reversal (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Clinton's abandonment of the idea of linking
trade with China on human rights improvements represents a stunning
reversal of the policies he espoused both during his 1992 presidential
campaign and during his first year in office.
</P>
<P>
As recently as the past few weeks, in fact, Clinton administration
officials were insisting that without some further and meaningful
steps in human rights by the Beijing regime, there was no way the
president could renew China's most-favored-nation, or MFN, trade
privileges.
</P>
<P>
In the end, Clinton simply caved in. And, in the process, his MFN
debacle gave China a chance to demonstrate the limits of American
power and the hollowness of American fantasies of omnipotence. The
United States found that it couldn't force China to change its human
rights policies, at least not without imposing costs that American
businesses were unwilling to bear.
</P>
<P>
``A great society, so large and with such built-in habits does not
change overnight,'' Clinton acknowledged Thursday, using words very
similar to those used over the past year by the many critics of his
policy.
</P>
<P>
In the view of some China scholars and experts, Clinton's blending
of threat-and-retreat left the United States in worse position than if
he had never threatened at all. For the message to the world, to
China's Asian neighbors and to the Chinese people themselves is that
China can defy the United States virtually at will.
</P>
<P>
``This is being handled in a way that is eroding our credibility
with the Chinese,'' Kenneth Lieberthal, a University of Michigan China
specialist, observed recently. ``... The Chinese can see that with
this administration, when it's time to decide whether to hold 'em or
fold 'em, it will fold. This administration will take a fig leaf and
give away the store.''
</P>
<P>
The administration is left hoping now that what it calls ``a new
policy'' toward China will produce more results than the past one.
That new policy is based on what administration officials Thursday
vaguely called a ``strategic relationship'' with China -- a phrase that
sounds somewhat like the words former Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger once employed.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, the administration has made a series of
concessions to China in hopes of winning its cooperation for some
changes in its human rights policies.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Clinton met with Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Seattle. On the
eve of that meeting, the administration cleared the way for the sale
of a Cray supercomputer to China. The administration approved the sale
of several U.S.-made satellites to China. And it ended the ban on
high-level military contacts that had been imposed by the Bush
administration.
</P>
<P>
``They decided to give everything away,'' observed one U.S.
official. ``... Somehow, there is still this view that if we just give
them enough, they will do what we want. It just doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
Throughout the past year, while making these other concessions, the
administration held up on the one thing it felt, rightly, was the
thing China wanted and needed most: most-favored-nation trade status,
which allows tens of billions of dollars in Chinese exports to be sold
in this country with low duties.
</P>
<P>
But in the end, China called Clinton's bluff. It turned out that
Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., was right when he called the threat to
withdraw MFN benefits ``the economic equivalent of a nuclear bomb'' -- 
that is, a weapon too powerful to use.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Yet no one could have envisioned a year ago just how many steps
China would take to show its utter disregard for the administration
and his policies.
</P>
<P>
In March, Chinese security officials rounded up a series of
prominent dissidents while Secretary of State Warren Christopher was
in Beijing. In April, they locked up Wei Jingsheng, China's most
prominent advocate of democracy, who had been freed last September
after more than 14 years in jail. Wei is still in detention.
</P>
<P>
China has refused to make even some of those human rights
concessions the Clinton administration considered relatively easy to
achieve. Early this year, U.S. officials believed China was ready to
stop its jamming of the Voice of America and other foreign broadcasts
into China. That action might come at the time of Christopher's
mission in March, they believed.
</P>
<P>
But China hasn't even done this yet. The most it has been willing
to do has been to receive a delegation to ``discuss'' some of the
technical aspects of broadcasting in China.
</P>
<P>
China's intransigence goes beyond the area of human rights. There
has been no sign, for example, that China has been willing to help the
United States much in trying to persuade North Korea to abandon its
nuclear weapons program. In Cambodia, the Khmer Rouge, who were once
considered China's client, are once again threatening to overrun the
government in Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
What went wrong?
</P>
<P>
Some officials, including veterans of the Bush administration,
question the entire style and underpinnings of Clinton's approach.
They argue that it was counter-productive to confront China head-on.
</P>
<P>
``Once you put your fist in the face of the Chinese and tell them
they have to do something, they tend to go rigid,'' says Douglas Paal,
who served as director of Asian affairs for the Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration misjudged a year ago how far China would
be willing to go. Administration officials sincerely believed that the
conditions they were imposing on China would be relatively easy to
meet. ``Narrow, narrow'' was how Assistant Secretary of State John H.
F. Shattuck described the U.S. conditions to Hong Kong reporters.
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese regime -- facing both the threat of new social
unrest inside China and a looming struggle to see who will succeed the
ailing Deng Xiaoping as China's paramount leader -- was unwilling to do
even the things the administration considered modest.
</P>
<P>
The administration misread the strength of sentiment in the
American business community, which didn't like the idea of tying MFN
renewal to human rights in the first place and which grew increasingly
threatened and nervous by the prospect of a cut off in trade.
</P>
<P>
Clinton himself bears the ultimate responsibility for being either
unwilling or unable to impose discipline on his own top administration
officials.
</P>
<P>
But not all of the blame for the American retreat should go to
Clinton. It must also be shared with Congress, an institution which
Clinton administration officials also misjudged.
</P>
<P>
Over a period of three years, from 1990 to 1992, Congress
repeatedly passed laws tying renewal of China's MFN benefits to
improvements in human rights. It was what is known as a ``free vote.''
Each time, President Bush vetoed the legislation, just as Congress
knew he would.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton in effect borrowed the vetoed Democratic
legislation and put it into the executive order he imposed last year.
And this year, for the first time, Congress has been forced to deal
with the real-life consequences of its legislation. China failed to
make significant human rights improvements, and that meant that the
cutoff in MFN which Congress originally threatened might actually be
imposed.
</P>
<P>
In droves, congressmen retreated. It turns out that members of
Congress -- including leading Democrats like Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J.,
 -- were willing to vote for a linkage between human rights and trade
with China only at a time when they knew their legislation would be
vetoed. Under the circumstances, it seems fair to conclude that the
congressional Democrats weren't serious about linking trade and human
rights, but rather were using China as a partisan issue against Bush.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
``Times have changed,`` said Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., ``It was easy
for Congress to take the positions it did during the Bush
administration.''
</P>
<P>
The American retreat was of far-reaching, even historic,
significance for China and its relations with the rest of the world.
The Chinese regime was faced with a direct challenge from the United
States, and it proved that the United States could not back up its
threats.
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 1, 1949, on the day the People's Republic of China was
founded, Mao Tsetung stood up above Tian An Men Square and declared to
cheering thousands: ``The Chinese people have stood up.'' Chinese
leaders may soon proclaim the modern-day corollary: ``President
Clinton has sat down.''

 Residents Cheer Silence As Burglar Alarm Is Cut Off (Baltimore) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BALTIMORE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A burglar alarm from hell was finally silenced Thursday
 -- after six days of nearly constant noise -- when a police officer
climbed a ladder in a blinding rainstorm and snipped the wire.
</P>
<P>
A cheer erupted from a watching crowd when silence descended
suddenly on the normally quiet, tree-shaded court in suburban
Baltimore. It was almost eerie for a few seconds.
</P>
<P>
``Thank you, Jesus,'' shouted Joan Sheppard, the next-door
neighbor, raising her arms to the sky and ignoring the pelting rain.
</P>
<P>
Once the alarm was silenced, the crowd scattered quickly under the
deluge and the daylong circus occasioned by the presence of television
units and a rock radio station was over.
</P>
<P>
The alarm, at the home of a psychologist traveling in Indonesia,
went off early Saturday morning. There was a brief break later that
morning when an accident nearby caused a power outage and another
short break, during another outage early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Except for the two brief periods, the alarm had pulsed
continuously, generally making life miserable for the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
Exasperated to the extreme, Sheppard spent much of Thursday trying
to get a court order to allow police to shut off the alarm.
</P>
<P>
Because the matter involved private property and there was no
emergency, the county attorney's office was called in and lawyers
began working on a petition to the court.
</P>
<P>
But as the lawyers debated, the whoop-whoop-whoop of the alarm
continued unrelentingly.
</P>
<P>
An employee of the psychologist was in contact with him Tuesday and
he was supposed to have air-freighted a house key back to her from
Asia.
</P>
<P>
When the key didn't arrive, police contacted the woman again and
she agreed to act as the homeowner's agent.
</P>
<P>
She gave Lt. J.A. Spiroff permission to do what had to be done.
</P>
<P>
Just as the lieutenant signaled his men, the skies opened up. As
one officer steadied the waiting ladder, the second climbed to roof
level, pulled loose some siding and cut the wire.

 U.S. Settles Antitrust Suit With British Glassmaking Firm (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Moving to break ``a licensing stranglehold'' on
glassmaking that keeps U.S. companies out of foreign markets, the
Justice Department said Thursday it has settled an antitrust suit
against a British glass company.
</P>
<P>
The suit was filed under a U.S. policy designed to protect U.S.
exports from anti-competitive conduct by foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Janet Reno, who announced the suit and the
settlement simultaneously, said the action ``will open new markets
abroad for American businesses exporting high-tech services.''
</P>
<P>
Robert E. Litan, deputy assistant attorney general for antitrust,
said the settlement with Pilkington plc and its U.S. subsidiary could
open the door to between $150 million and $1.25 billion in exports for
U.S. companies through the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The suit was the first brought under a 1992 policy that permits the
Justice Department to take antitrust action against foreign businesses
that harm U.S. export trade -- without having to demonstrate harm to
U.S. consumers. When the policy was announced by the Bush
administration, it was widely believed that Japanese firms would be
the immediate targets.
</P>
<P>
Litan said other cases are under investigation but he declined to
name either the companies or the countries involved.
</P>
<P>
Pilkington dominates the world's $15 billion-a-year float glass
industry, which manufactures flat glass used in most cars and
buildings. The complaint accused Pilkington of closing off foreign
markets to U.S. companies -- and costing U.S. jobs -- by strictly
limiting the use of commercial flat glass technology, part of which it
developed and patented more than 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Although Pilkington's patents expired long ago, placing the
technology in the public domain, the Justice Department complaint said
the company restrained competition by using licensing arrangements to
prevent American glass producers from employing the technology outside
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Sir Robin Nicholson, a Pilkington director, contended that the
settlement -- in the form of a consent decree -- will have ``no material
economic impact on the company.''
</P>
<P>
In a phone interview, he said the company had agreed to the decree
 -- while denying unlawful conduct -- for two primary reasons. The decree
allows the company to continue licensing technology it has developed
since 1983. The second factor was ``pure cost,'' Nicholson said,
estimating that the company would not lose more than $1 million a year
under the decree, while continued litigation would have cost ``many
millions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
However, K. Craig Wildfang, special counsel to Anne K. Bingaman,
assistant attorney general for antitrust, noted that the decree covers
technology disclosed to U.S. licensees, the last of which occurred in
1982. It also frees up technology that licensees added themselves
after 1982, he said.

 Clinton Decides to Extend MFN Status for China (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Clinton Thursday reversed course on China
and renewed its trade privileges despite what he said was Beijing's
lack of significant progress on human rights.
</P>
<P>
Echoing the case made by George Bush when he was president, Clinton
said he was convinced the Chinese would take more steps to improve
human rights if the issue were separated from the threat of trade
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
``This decision offers us the best opportunity to lay the basis for
long-term sustainable progress on human rights and for the advancement
of our other interests with China,'' he said at a news conference
announcing his decision to extend China's most-favored-nation (MFN)
trade status.
</P>
<P>
To demonstrate what he stressed was his administration's continuing
concern about human rights in China, Clinton said he was banning the
import of Chinese munitions and taking several other small steps to
support the pro-democracy cause in China.
</P>
<P>
But his action stopped well short of appeals by Senate Majority
Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.,
for selected sanctions on some Chinese products as a way to penalize
China for failing to improve human rights. Both said they would
introduce legislation that continues a link between trade privileges
and human rights improvements.
</P>
<P>
``I disagree with the decision,'' Mitchell said of Clinton's move.
``This decision will confirm for the regime the success of its policy
of repression on human rights and manipulation on trade.'' Several
other Democratic senators, however, issued statements of support and
said they would join Clinton in Congress in resisting legislation to
alter the trade status.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said that the decision reflected a key role
China can play in geopolitics, specifically ``maintaining stability on
the Korean peninsula and preventing the proliferation of nuclear
weapons.''
</P>
<P>
Clinton had been the subject of heavy lobbying by American business
interests and his economic advisers to continue China's trade
privileges. With China now the world's fastest growing economy, the
United States exports $8 billion a year there, which sustains up to
150,000 American jobs. Many major American businesses see even greater
potential in Chinese markets, expecting China to become a massive
purchaser over the next decade of the phones, electronic gadgets and
thousands of other products made in America.
</P>
<P>
``I think we have to see our relations with China within a broader
context'' than simply human rights, Clinton said, adding that the link
between rights and trade was no longer tenable. ``We have reached the
end of the usefulness of that policy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Human rights groups and a strong lobby in Congress had pressed
Clinton to adhere to the goal he set last year in an executive order
that made renewal of China's MFN status dependent on ``overall
significant progress'' in human rights. Clinton in his presidential
campaign had sharply attacked Bush for extending trade privileges to
China in the years following the 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy
activists in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, accusing him of ``coddling
criminals.''
</P>
<P>
But Clinton said Thursday he has had a change of heart. ``Let me
ask you the same question I have asked myself,'' he said. ``Will we do
more to advance the cause of human rights if China is isolated.''
</P>
<P>
What the United States policy should be, he added, is ``to
intensify and broaden its relations'' with Beijing, not isolate it. He
acknowledged that the one sanction he was imposing -- the ban on
imports of guns and ammunition from China involving about $200 million
in sales -- constituted little more than a ``discrete'' symbol of U.S.
displeasure. Most weapons are made by the Peoples Liberation Army,
agent of the 1989 crackdown that set off congressional calls for
revoking China's trade status.
</P>
<P>
The other measures he announced include increased broadcasts for
Radio-Free Asia and the Voice of America, increased support for
non-governmental organizations working on human rights in China and
the development with U.S. business leaders of a voluntary set of
principles for business activity in China.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's decision came after an intensive, sometimes fractious,
debate within the administration over what steps to take and how. At
one point, the president was leaning toward extending the trade
privileges, but putting sanctions on a range of military-made
products. The Treasury and Defense departments vehemently objected,
and from the outset the president's economic advisers argued that
trade and human rights should not be linked.
</P>
<P>
In assessing China's human rights record over the past year,
Secretary of State Warren Christopher reported to Clinton earlier this
week that China had made progress in allowing emigration and had begun
complying with an agreement that produces investigations of the use of
prison labor in making Chinese goods.
</P>
<P>
But Christopher also concluded that the Chinese had not made
progress in complying with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
in providing an acceptable accounting for political and religious
prisoners and in treating them humanely. He also found no change in
China's repression of Tibet and no end to China's jamming broadcasts
by the Voice of America.

 MARKET BEAT: Fund Investors Wax Conservative After Fed Hikes 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a few tightenings of the national credit spigot, the Federal
Reserve Board already seems to have achieved one of its goals for
1994: The central bank has converted more than a few mutual fund
investors into models of financial conservatism.
</P>
<P>
That is apparent in the latest report on fund investment activity
from the industry's chief trade group, the Investment Company
Institute. The ICI said Thursday that gross purchases of stock and
bond fund shares totaled $40.6 billion in April, down sharply from
$53.4 billion in March and even below the pace of $41.1 billion in
April 1993.
</P>
<P>
Net new cash flow, which measures fund purchases minus redemptions
and after adjustment for net exchanges among funds in the same
families, was $11.3 billion for stock funds in April, a rebound from
March's depressed $6.6 billion but still below the $11.7 billion of
April 1993.
</P>
<P>
For bond funds, net new cash flow was a negative $4.8 billion in
April, compared with a negative $7.7 billion in March and a positive
$10 billion in April 1993.
</P>
<P>
The seeming contradiction in the numbers above -- gross fund
purchases were down between March and April, but net cash flow
improved -- actually is easily explained. Overall, investors' appetite
for funds declined in April. But because fewer investors redeemed
shares in April than March, cash flow was better.
</P>
<P>
This month, fund companies report a further easing of the panic
that had gripped some fund investors in March and April, when markets
convulsed because of the Fed's decision to raise short-term interest
rates for the first time in five years. Redemptions are down again in
May, and a respectable number of people are buying funds.
</P>
<P>
But what's in demand are mostly the kind of stock funds
traditionally favored by conservative, long-term investors, some fund
companies say. Meanwhile, bond funds -- many of which have dropped more
sharply in value than stock funds this year -- still appear to be
losing money, though at a slower pace than in March and April.
</P>
<P>
At fund giant Fidelity Investments in Boston, spokesman Neal
Litvack says net new cash flow into the company is expected to total
$1.5 billion this month, up from $1.3 billion in April. But more than
90 percent of this month's cash flow is going into stock funds,
Litvack says. Bond funds are basically flat, he says, meaning money
coming in is just replacing the money that's leaving.
</P>
<P>
Significantly, Litvack says, Fidelity investors now are shying away
from small-stock funds and ``sector'' funds that target stocks of
specific industries. Instead, the company's most popular stock funds
this month are conservative names such as the Blue Chip fund and the
Puritan fund, which are marketed as long-term holdings for relatively
cautious investors.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, at the Kemper mutual funds in Chicago, the best-selling
investment this month is the Total Return fund, a balanced (stock and
bond) fund that is having its best month in a year. In contrast,
Kemper said that its U.S. Government Securities bond fund has
continued to experience redemptions this month.
</P>
<P>
Small investors' ongoing interest in blue-chip stock funds and in
balanced funds, while pure bond funds suffer, may not seem like
evidence of a turn to conservatism. After all, academics would
typically argue that bonds are more conservative investments than
stocks, at least in the long run.
</P>
<P>
But the problem in the bond market by late last year was that
almost everyone had come to believe that interest rates only went
down. Speculation in bonds was rampant, in large part because many
bond owners didn't even know they were speculating: They really didn't
think they could lose money in bonds.
</P>
<P>
In tightening credit this year, the Fed had more in mind than
slowing the economy. The central bank also wanted to slow the tidal
wave of money inflating stock and bond prices, before U.S. markets
began to look like a rerun of Japan, 1989.
</P>
<P>
From mutual fund sales trends since March, it's clear that
investors have gotten the message. What is evident is that many
investors in stocks understand the risks, and are comfortable with
them, so they're still buying (albeit conservatively). The continuing
outflow of money from bond funds, however, suggests that there still
are many people who either didn't understand bonds' risks, or finally
do understand -- and no longer want to be a part of that game.

 Summer's Events Could Make or Break Clinton Presidency (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a make-or-break summer approaches, the White House
is trying to quell a growing sense of panic among Democrats that
President Clinton's signature legislative goal on health care is
stalled in Congress and that the party now seems certain to suffer
serious losses in the November midterm elections.
</P>
<P>
Democratic National Chairman David Wilhelm, after meeting with
Democratic House leaders Thursday, told Newsday that the DNC would
launch a $5 million ad campaign in about a month to boost momentum on
health care as the legislation moves to the floor of the House and
Senate.
</P>
<P>
But at the moment no one knows whether the legislation will get
through the key congressional committees by then -- all five of them
already have missed their informal Memorial Day deadline -- or what the
bill will include. ``The number of different views far exceeds the
number of senators,'' Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine,
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Clinton has trouble on other fronts. An important ally,
Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., is expected to step down as House Ways
and Means chairman next week when he is either indicted or accepts a
plea bargain on corruption charges. A lingering problem will be
revived with the threat by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., that Senate
Republicans will hold all legislation hostage until Whitewater
hearings have been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Thursday, after special counsel Robert Fiske Jr. appealed anew for
restraint from lawmakers, Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said that
the House would conduct no Whitewater hearings before late July.
</P>
<P>
There was another embarrassing fillip Thursday when White House
administration director David Watkins was forced to resign after
reports he had taken a Marine helicopter to play golf at a suburban
course.
</P>
<P>
``I think we now have real problems,'' a senior Democrat and
Clinton ally said. ``If we get bogged down on the two parts of the
domestic agenda that really defined his being a new Democrat -- welfare
reform and health care -- I think we go into the (1994) elections quite
weak. And I think he is the issue.''
</P>
<P>
The loss in a special election Tuesday of a Kentucky House seat
that Democrats had held for 129 years has fueled ``political panic''
among congressional Democrats, he added.
</P>
<P>
``A lot of them don't think they're going to be there in January if
they're too closely identified with the president,'' he said. But
Wilhelm said it was simply ``a wake-up call'' that should propel
Democrats to enact a health care package before going home to
campaign.
</P>
<P>
There are White House officials who view the situation as just
another chapter in a Perils-of-Pauline presidency that has become
accustomed to averting disaster at the last possible moment.
</P>
<P>
The next 10 weeks are described by some as the period that may well
determine whether Clinton's term ultimately will be seen as
successful. He staked much of his 1992 campaign on changing the health
care system and has championed it over any other goal, including
welfare revision. Now administration officials figure congressional
committees must finish their work by July 1 so the House and Senate
can vote before they adjourn in mid-August for summer recess.
Otherwise, they say, no plan is likely to be enacted this year, and
the prospects next year will be worse.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
It is a sign of Clinton's weakened position that Democratic
congressional leaders have told the White House not to become engaged
in negotiating the compromise package.
</P>
<P>
``The label `Clinton Health Care Plan' has become a net negative,''
Republican pollster William McInturff warned.
</P>
<P>
A key ally on health care said: ``If we are lucky enough to get
something out of committee -- and we do need some luck -- the kiss of
death would be for the Clinton administration to embrace it as their
own. The only way a majority of members can vote for this on the floor
of either the House or the Senate is to wave the piece of paper and
say, `This is not the Clinton bill.' ''

 Military Brass Undercut U.N. Peace Aid, Sources Say (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On May 5, as part of a long-awaited Clinton
administration policy initiative, the Pentagon announced its
willingness to share the U.S. costs of U.N. peacekeeping, and it set
aside $300 million of its 1995 budget for such operations.
</P>
<P>
Now the Defense Department's top military brass are quietly
cooperating with a Republican-led effort in Congress to torpedo the
expenditure it promised, according to State Department, Pentagon and
congressional sources.
</P>
<P>
House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia, with the support of
key Democratic allies of the military, has proposed an amendment to
the Defense Authorization Bill that would prohibit the Defense
Department from spending any of its $275 billion budget on
peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
Although the $300 million budget item for peacekeeping is a Clinton
administration proposal, a senior State Department official said the
Pentagon is ``playing a double-game,'' indirectly helping efforts to
block that expenditure after agreeing to it for the first time.
``Let's say they've made it clear to their friends they would not be
unhappy if the amendment succeeds,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
If it does, a critical part of President Clinton's directive last
month -- aimed at setting guidelines for U.S. participation in the
growing number of U.N. peacekeeping operations -- would be crippled,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
``There is no doubt that if this amendment passes it would severely
hurt a crucial element'' of the president's plan,'' said the State
Department official, who asked to remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
The United States has come under considerable criticism from the
United Nations and other international organizations for its
opposition to sending its armed forces to participate in peacekeeping
operations, preferring to leave that to other nations. And the United
States, while insisting on a larger voice in U.N. peacekeeping and
humanitarian operations, is more than $1.1 billion behind in paying
its share of the peacekeeping budget.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration designed its initiative so that the
United States could at least offer funds, if not manpower, and pay the
United Nations what it owes.
</P>
<P>
And because the Pentagon wanted to exercise some influence over
operations in which U.S. forces might become involved, the Defense
Department agreed to a policy of ``shared reponsibility,''
contributing part of the U.S. assessment along with the State
Department, which has been responsible for all of Washington's
peacekeeping bills until now.
</P>
<P>
Without the $300 million from the Pentagon budget, said the State
Department official, ``we will have to look elsewhere for the money,
but it is unlikely that we will be able to pay what we owe.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Sources said the measure blocking all Pentagon spending on
peacekeeping may have enough support to pass, and its opponents have
put off a vote until after the Memorial Day recess.
</P>
<P>
The White House has been of little help in pushing its own
position, said the congressional aide, partly because Clinton's
policies on peacekeeping have been ambiguous.
</P>
<P>
The State Department is hoping that if the measure passes the
House, it will be defeated in the Senate where Senate Armed Services
Committee Chairman Sam Nunn of Georgia is said to be more supportive
of the initiative.

 RENO AT LARGE: On Violent Punishment for Non-Violent Crimes 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The caning movement, like an infestation of crabgrass, seems to be
taking deep root in America, inspired by the example of the government
of Singapore where the criminal code is to this day inspired by the
example of its former imperial masters.
</P>
<P>
That the idea of caning youthful offenders in America should be
born of a practice originally instituted by insufferable British
colonial administrators to maintain order among their non-white
subjects is, to say the least, weird. But I suppose we must take it
seriously.
</P>
<P>
A member of the California Assembly has introduced a bill requiring
parents to paddle juvenile graffiti vandals in the presence of a judge
who could order a bailiff to take over if the whacks weren't severe
enough. A Sacramento City Council member has proposed a similar
municipal ordinance. A St. Louis alderman is pushing yet another law
prescribing three to four lashes. How long can it be before the school
board down in Tavares, Fla. institutes caning of any pupil who doesn't
agree to the superiority of American culture above all others?
</P>
<P>
Backers of public caning and its variations claim it would have the
salutary effect of humbling and embarrassing young miscreants who
might laugh off a week in jail. They are curiously off base. To begin
with, caning is a pre-19th century concept which ignores the vast
technological advancements which have been made in pain infliction
with the invention of electrodes that can be attached to strategic
parts of the body to cause excruciating discomfort and humiliation
without the danger of tissue injury and permanent scarring.
</P>
<P>
And while we're talking about violent punishment for non-violent
crimes, how about white collar offenses? What is it about people that
makes the idea of hitting somebody so attractive when it is done to
the young? Surely caning, if administered to perpetrators of
securities fraud, would have a humbling effect, make them look silly
to their peers and perhaps induce them to behave. Why not cane the
stuffing out of middle-aged speeders? Might teach them a lesson too.
</P>
<P>
What graffiti vandal is going to be convinced of the justness of
his punishment if he reads that Flagstar Companies, the owner of
Denny's restaurants, with annual revenues of $1.53 billion, gets off
with a $54 million judgment to settle racial bias suits. The
systematic offenses described by black customers of Denny's were
somehow more crude, unkind, mindless and antisocial than any picture
you can imagine of a young lout having his say with a spray can.
Anyway, Flagstar's stock declined a mere 37 cents a share on news of
the settlement which suggests a little punitive paddling might have
been thrown in as a highly instructive example to the nation's
would-be bigots.
</P>
<P>
If we were really serious about stamping out graffiti, we might ban
the manufacture of spray cans and see how quickly these young fools
get bored with the mess and bother of carrying around brushes and
rollers. It was, after all, the aerosol can that made the graffiti
explosion possible. Before then, teen-agers carved their names on
trees or scribbled in pencil on bathroom stalls. Also we might get a
little perspective and try to imagine a society in which graffiti
vandalism was the worst of teen-age crimes, a society in which
13-year-olds did not rape, murder and mug. Who of us these days
wouldn't settle for it over what we've got?

 THE TICKER: Memorial Days Past ... and Future? 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LOOKING BACK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking of Memorial Day, I checked back to see
where the Dow Jones industrial average closed on the day before the
end-of-May holiday in past years. Last year 3,527.43; five years ago
2,475.55; a decade ago 1,107.10; 20 years ago 815.65 and 50 years ago
141.24.
</P>
<P>
LOOKING AHEAD -- ``Not used to the market's wild daily swings?
Better put on a Dramamine patch. History suggests that this could be a
very volatile year. The past two years were the least volatile since
World War II, and it's interesting to note that nine of the 10 single
or low-volatility periods were followed by a high-volatility year,
where the trading range exceeded 23 percent. Translation: We could see
a 900-point range between the Dow high and low this year.'' (InvesTech
newsletter)
</P>
<P>
IT'S YOUR MONEY -- ``The holdings of your bond fund may surprise
you. There is a good chance today that any bond fund you buy, or may
have bought, has gone beyond plain vanilla bonds into exotic
securities known as derivatives. The use of derivatives -- concocted
and complicated instruments based on the value of some underlying
security -- is growing by leaps and bounds. Used blindly by a fund
manager, they certainly can increase the risk of a mutual fund
investment.'' (Financial World ) Ticker suggestion: Ask a lot of
questions and read the prospectus carefully before buying any bond
fund.
</P>
<P>
THE DARK SIDE -- ``In the eight major declines we've had since the
end of World War II, the Dow Jones utilities have fallen roughly 88.5
percent as much as the industrials. The utilities peaked last August
31, and between that time and May 12 of this year, they lost a bit
over 31 percent. Therefore, even if the recent low of 177.04 turns out
to be the final low for the Dow Jones utility average, the Dow
industrials will likely decline another 1,062 points to a final bottom
of 2,598 in late July before the bear market is over.'' (Michael
O'Higgins, O'Higgins Asset Management, in Barron's, May 23)
</P>
<P>
SUN ALSO RISES -- ``The aggressive growth sector of the market is
presently making a very significant bottom, and this should set up a
very nice advance in that area -- and the market as a whole -- this
summer.'' (Walter Deemer's Strategies and Insights) ... ``When bonds
and utilities start acting better, the stock market won't be far
behind. By our calculations, the tightening phase of the Fed should be
almost over with.'' (Wall Street Generalist).

 New Fears for Jews of Germany (Frankfurt) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
FRANKFURT, Germany
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kissing their parents goodbye, hugging lunch
boxes and notebooks, 300 Jewish children pour into the I.E.
Lichtigfeld primary school each morning through an iron gate and
electric doors with bomb-proof glass. Police patrol the streets around
the school in the city's lush West End neighborhood while video
cameras monitor its hallways.
</P>
<P>
Inside, a few boys don yarmulkes and sit down with girls in
ponytails for reading, writing and arithmetic, Hebrew and Judaism.
Throughout their lessons, the children address the particular dilemma
of being German and Jewish.
</P>
<P>
``In history classes, we speak of their families. They know their
parents didn't have any aunts and uncles or grandparents,'' said Alexa
Brum, director of Frankfurt's only Jewish school.
</P>
<P>
``They also know that after awhile they will have to go out to
 gymnasium (public high school),'' she said. ``We teach them that it
is absolutely normal to be Jewish and that they should be proud -- 
proud people who eventually have to decide if they want to integrate
into this society or go elsewhere. Someday, they must make a
decision.''
</P>
<P>
To stay or leave, integrate or isolate. These are the questions
that plagued the Holocaust survivors who settled in Germany after the
Nazi extermination of 6 million European Jews, and that once again
weigh on their children and grandchildren who see a resurgence of
anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
Frankfurt is one of the most ethnically diverse cities in Germany
and is home to a quarter of the republic's 40,000 Jews. But even here,
Jews say they increasingly feel unwelcome in their own country and,
occasionally, threatened.
</P>
<P>
Unified Germany is experiencing a growing sense of national pride
that frightens many Jews for whom nationalism harks back to the Third
Reich. They see Europe's most powerful country increasingly anxious
that it will be diminished by European unity. And they watch a small
but emboldened radical right finding resonance among Germans who seek
someone to blame for their severe economic problems -- including the
highest unemployment since World War II.
</P>
<P>
In this climate, post-war taboos against racism and anti-Semitism
are breaking down: In the last two years, Turkish immigrants have been
killed in arson attacks by rightists in Moeln and Solingen; scores of
Germans watched and applauded as arsonists set fire to a home for
foreign asylum-seekers in Rostock, and only two weeks ago, a mob of
rightists and hooligans attacked Africans and destroyed a restaurant
owned by Turks in Magdeburg.
</P>
<P>
Once-anonymous hate mail has been sent to Jewish leaders with
unabashed signatures. And neo-Nazis fire-bombed the synagogue in
Luebeck on the eve of Passover -- the first such attack since the
Nazis' Kristallnacht rampage against Jews in 1938.
</P>
<P>
After the synagogue-burning, radical-rightist politician and former
SS officer Franz Schoenhuber said Frankfurt's Jewish leaders are to
blame for anti-Semitism in Germany.
</P>
<P>
``The rats have come out of the holes,'' Brum said. ``There has
always been anti-Semitism, but now they dare to say it out loud and
dare to throw bombs.''
</P>
<P>
About half a million Jews lived in Germany before the Nazis were
voted into power in 1933. Nine years later, the 30,000-member Jewish
community in Frankfurt was officially decreed to have been eradicated.
It had been a vibrant community of well-to-do German Jews who
contributed financially and culturally to the city -- bankers,
industrialists and intellectuals from the so-called Frankfurt School
of social scientists -- and of Polish immigrants who provided craftsmen
and laborers. Liberal Frankfurt even had a Jewish mayor.
</P>
<P>
``Jews were not just tolerated, they were accepted,'' said Jewish
author Valentin Senger. ``They were a part of Frankfurt.''
</P>
<P>
Within a couple years, the Nazis turned the city against Jews,
Gypsies and anyone who did not fit the Aryan ideal, and carted them
off to concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
Senger's apparently was the only Jewish family to survive the Third
Reich in Frankfurt, passing as non-Jews and working in the Resistance.
</P>
<P>
After the war, the British and Americans set up displaced persons
camps in Germany for survivors of Adolf Hitler's concentration camps.
One of them, Zeilsheim, provided the base for Frankfurt's post-war
Jewish community, which today numbers about 6,500.
</P>
<P>
Most of the settlers were merchants and craftsmen from small Jewish
communities in Poland who never meant to remain in Germany.
</P>
<P>
They had children and reluctantly put down roots, reopening the
synagogue, a community center, a home for the elderly, a school for
their children. But they were always ``sitting on packed bags''
because they wished to leave or believed that one day they might have
to leave. They wanted nothing to do with Germans, whom they considered
immoral.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the children of survivors were raised in a Jewish ghetto of
post-war Germany with all its contradictions.
</P>
<P>
Their youth organizations encouraged them to move to Israel. Their
parents would not let them date Gentiles. But they went to German high
schools, spoke German, held German passports. They were citizens of
Germany exempted from military service as the offspring of Nazi
victims.
</P>
<P>
``It was schizophrenic,'' said David Lieberberg, managing director
of the popular music department at Frankfurt's Old Opera House. ``My
parents were always proud when I'd come home from school with A's in
German.'' But the minute his sister was caught with a German
boyfriend, she was sent away to Israel.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Largely Protestant and Roman Catholic Germany is a country with
strict norms governing appearance and behavior.
</P>
<P>
Jews generally have different biblical names and darker
complexions. They celebrate different religious holidays. And because
of this, German-born Jews are frequently asked where they come from.
In adolescence, many children of survivors began to challenge their
parents: Why did you come to Germany? Why did you stay?
</P>
<P>
Their parents did not have answers. They had stayed because they
had stayed.
</P>
<P>
Frankfurt Jews first emerged from isolation in the fall of 1985 in
what became known internationally as the Fassbinder Affair. Reiner
Werner Fassbinder's play ``Garbage, the City and Death'' was to be
staged at a local theater, and Frankfurt's Jews were outraged by a
work they judged to be anti-Semitic. On opening night, they occupied
the stage and closed the play down.
</P>
<P>
For some, the public controversy marked the coming of age of the
German Jewish community. For others, it was another way of hiding, of
quieting public discussion. In either case, it marked the emergence of
Jewish leaders who believed that Jews were in Germany to stay and must
interact with the community at large.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
To stay or leave, integrate or isolate. Younger Jews began to make
peace with their German heritage and to accept that they belonged to
two cultures. Their bags were unpacked -- they meant to stay in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
``I grew up here, went to school here, read German books, German is
my mother tongue,'' said Josse Reich, 31, the son of Holocaust
survivors. ``I make fun of the Germans. I imitate them very well
because I am them.''
</P>
<P>
At the Lichtigfeld school, children sing Jewish songs and celebrate
their heritage unfazed by the tight security measures around them.
</P>
<P>
But director Brum notes that 400 Russian Jewish families that were
supposed to emigrate to Frankfurt this year have not arrived. Many
stayed in Russia or moved to Israel because they fear anti-Semitism in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
Brum, meanwhile, bought a small summer house in France a couple
years ago that she says gives her family a sense of security -- a place
to go ``if something happens'' in Germany.
</P>
<P>
And many Jews born and raised in Frankfurt are beginning to ask
themselves whether they should raise their children here.
</P>
<P>
``I don't want my children to live in fear,'' David Lieberberg
worried aloud.
</P>
<P>
``I am German. I feel very German,'' added Reich. ``But since
having a daughter a year ago, I don't know if I really want to stay
now.''

 Ortega's Departure Signals Changes for Nicaragua (Managua) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MANAGUA, Nicaragua
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The last time President Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro tried to fire Gen. Humberto Ortega, the powerful army chief
lashed out publicly at government officials for having ``sold out'' to
pressure from Washington. He refused to budge.
</P>
<P>
Months later, Ortega has finally agreed to step down, having
successfully delayed his retirement date by more than a year.
</P>
<P>
The Ortega episode underscores the difficulties the Chamorro
government has experienced as it struggles to bring the army,
dominated by leftist Sandinistas, under civilian control.
</P>
<P>
``Nicaragua will have for the first time in its history a national
army, clearly subordinated to civilian power, committed to the
Constitution, that does not belong and is not subordinated to the
interests of any political party or social class,'' Chamorro said in a
ceremony last week to announce Ortega's departure.
</P>
<P>
``The years of armies that belong to parties, which made the birth
of democracy so difficult in Nicaragua, are now behind us.''
</P>
<P>
In addition to changing the army chief, the government has finally
drafted a long-awaited military code that for the first time gives the
president formal authority over the army commander. It also sets term
limits for senior officers.
</P>
<P>
Still, despite Chamorro's stated intentions, Sandinista influence
on the army will not end with Ortega's departure next year. His likely
successor is Maj. Gen. Joaquin Cuadra, another veteran Sandinista. And
the entire officers corps remains Sandinista.
</P>
<P>
Chamorro defeated former President Daniel Ortega, Humberto's
brother, and the Sandinista Front in presidential elections in 1990.
She named herself Defense Minister but stunned her followers by
retaining Humberto Ortega as army chief, saying his presence was
necessary to ensure the peaceful downsizing of Nicaragua's huge
military apparatus.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials and Chamorro's conservative critics denounced that
decision, arguing that continued Sandinista control of the army would
forever limit the civilian president's ability to govern. Demanding
Ortega's removal, the critics maintained that the army could not
become a professional and non-political force as long as he and other
key Sandinistas remained in top positions.
</P>
<P>
Sandinista domination of security forces was one of the reasons the
United States gave for withholding millions of dollars in aid last
year.
</P>
<P>
Chamorro tried to dump Ortega in September, when she announced his
retirement at an Army Day ceremony. Shocked and furious, Ortega
stormed up to the president and said she had exceeded her authority.
She could not remove him, he told her.
</P>
<P>
But now the two have negotiated what the Sandinista newspaper
Barricada called ``a dignified withdrawal.'' Ortega will formally step
down on Feb. 21, 1995, the 100th anniversary of the birth of Augusto
Cesar Sandino, the guerrilla who fought U.S. Marines occupying
Nicaragua in the 1920s and 1930s and for whom the Sandinista National
Liberation Front is named.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
``The military has professed to be professional and non-political,
and at the same time we know that the whole corps of officers is
Sandinista,'' said a diplomat. ``It will be up to them to show they
are professional and non-political.''
</P>
<P>
The Sandinista People's Army swelled to become the largest army in
Central America during the 1980s, as it battled U.S.-backed Contra
rebels. It has been reduced dramatically, according to government
figures, from more than 85,000 troops to 14,000.
</P>
<P>
It is not completely clear what finally forced Ortega to accept
retirement now. However, he has told Nicaraguan reporters that he is
interested eventually in running for president.

 Quebec Independence Pushed Into Forefront Again (Toronto) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Canada is being dragged reluctantly into a new
confrontation over the future of French-speaking Quebec.
</P>
<P>
In the last two weeks, political leaders and commentators across
Canada have lobbed rhetorical grenades at each other over the revived
prospect of Quebec independence.
</P>
<P>
Two factors have pushed Quebec back to the top of the national
political agenda.
</P>
<P>
First is the pending provincial election there, which by law must
take place by fall. Virtually every poll shows the separatist Parti
Quebecois leading the governing Liberal Party. PQ leader Jacques
Parizeau has promised to begin laying the groundwork for separation
immediately upon his election and to hold a province-wide referendum
on independence within 10 months of taking office.
</P>
<P>
Second is the peripatetic Lucien Bouchard, leader of the Bloc
Quebecois, the PQ's separatist counterpart in the federal government
in Ottawa. Bouchard has become an international evangelist for
separatism.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Bouchard was in Paris seeking assurance of quick French
recognition of an independent Quebec. He did not get it, at least
publicly, but he did get saturation coverage in the Canadian media.
Earlier this month, he preached his separatist message in British
Columbia and Alberta, the Canadian political equivalent of
proselytizing for vegetarianism at a Texas cattlemen's convention.
</P>
<P>
Most of the resulting argument has focused not on whether Quebec
ought to be allowed to secede -- most Canadians agree that's for
Quebecers to decide -- but what the terms of separation ought to be:
What would the boundaries of the new country look like? Should the
native peoples of Quebec be permitted to opt out of independence and
keep their lands in Canada? What kind of economic relationship would
Canada have with a sovereign Quebec?
</P>
<P>
The commentary suggests that this could be a very nasty divorce
indeed.
</P>
<P>
``To hell with common sense, one-sided decency and compromise. You
don't win a country that way and you shouldn't lose one, either,''
stormed columnist Peter C. Newman in the national news weekly
Maclean's.
</P>
<P>
In media interviews, British Columbia Premier Michael Harcourt
predicted that his province would be ``the worst of enemies'' with an
independent Quebec. Saskatchewan Premier Roy Romanow accused
separatist leaders of pulling a ``con job'' on Quebec voters by
suggesting that separation would be simple and painless. Ron Irwin,
minister of Indian Affairs, declared that the federal government would
back native organizations that repudiated Quebec independence.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Jean Chretien, who like his predecessors for 25 of
the past 26 years is from Quebec, has sought to avoid the issue,
saying he remains confident his fellow Quebecers ultimately will
reject separation. That prompted Preston Manning of Alberta, leader of
the opposition Reform Party, to accuse the government this week of
``sleepwalking toward a ... constitutional crisis.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Quebec separatists argue that their French language and culture
cannot survive so long as they are a minority amid an English-speaking
majority. The province's relationship with the rest of the country has
been a political tripwire throughout Canadian history. The traditional
strategy has been to defuse it through compromise, but the most recent
attempts have failed acrimoniously.
</P>
<P>
The 1990 Meech Lake agreement and the 1992 Charlottetown accord
(both named for the places they were negotiated) proposed
constitutional reforms aimed at securing Quebec's special status
within Canada. Both went unratified. In the end, most English-speaking
Canadians thought Quebec was being given too much, and many Quebecers
thought it was not enough. The result was the re-emergence of the
Quebec independence movement after more than a decade in retreat and
heightened hostility in the rest of the country, especially the West.
</P>
<P>
Analysts are divided on how the latest arguments might affect the
upcoming Quebec election. Quebec voters have a history of
unpredictability. In 1976, they elected the late Rene Levesque, father
of the separatist movement, premier. But four years later they voted
down Levesque's province-wide referendum on sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Current polls show they might do it again. While the PQ is ahead of
the Liberals, the surveys also show much more uncertainty about full
separation. A poll over the weekend showed 52 percent opposed to
independence. It could all add up to a year of wrenching political
combat.

 Jaguar Spokesman Apologizes for Racial Slur (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The top U.S. spokesman for Jaguar, the British luxury
carmaker, has been suspended for using the word ``nigger'' at a
Washington luncheon meeting with journalists who cover the auto
industry.
</P>
<P>
Jaguar Vice President John Crawford was suspended Wednesday by
Jaguar's owner, Ford Motor Co., pending completion of an internal
investigation of the incident.
</P>
<P>
A Ford spokesman said it did not learn of the incident until
Tuesday night, explaining that Jaguar's public relations operation is
independent of Dearborn, Mich.-based Ford.
</P>
<P>
Ford officials called the incident ``unfortunate'' and said both
companies deeply regret it.
</P>
<P>
``It's a very unpleasant situation; the facts are fairly
straightforward,'' a Ford spokesman said Thursday. But he said the
case goes beyond the mere facts. ``There is a governance issue with
regard to our own company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
During a discussion of the federal luxury car tax in the United
States, Crawford referred to rival Mercedes-Benz as ``the biggest
nigger in the woodpile.''
</P>
<P>
The incident was reported in Wednesday's editions of USA Today.
</P>
<P>
Crawford has sent letters of apology to each reporter present at
the luncheon, acknowledging that he was guilty of ``gross
insensitivity.''
</P>
<P>
He said the offending phrase was one that was commonly used in his
native Australia and it ``just slipped out.''
</P>
<P>
Washington Post reporter Warren Brown, who attended the May 12
meeting and was the only black in the room, said ``the phrasing was
offensive. The context wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
Brown said Crawford was reaching for examples to show how different
sides were lining up over the auto luxury-tax issue. ``In doing so, he
used an unfortunate phrase,'' Brown said, ``comparing a competitor to
``the nigger in the woodpile.' It was clear, from the context of his
comment, that he meant no offense to me or any other black person. He
later apologized. I accepted.''

 Derivative-Regulation Bill Introduced (New York) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A day after top banking regulators told Congress they
didn't want more legislative authority to supervise financial
derivatives, two congressmen have introduced a bill to do precisely
that.
</P>
<P>
House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Tex., and
ranking Republican Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa initiated a bill to protect
the financial system and ensure that taxpayers will not have to bail
out banks that might fail in a financial crisis because of large
derivatives obligations.
</P>
<P>
Banks sell the complex, risk-laden financial instruments to
corporations and speculators that are looking either to protect their
investments' value or to take big bets.
</P>
<P>
Unlike stocks, derivatives are contracts that do not entitle
holders to any stake in a business or its profits, but rather pay off
if certain indexes reach designated levels.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez and Leach worry that banks eager for hefty fees from such
deals might enter contracts with questionable partners and lose vast
amounts of money as banks and savings and loan associations did in
real estate loans in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The bill largely codifies regulatory steps some banking regulators
are already taking.
</P>
<P>
``The key is that they should take a uniform approach to regulating
and supervising derivatives activities,'' said a banking committee
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Congressional sources said the bill's chances of passage were
unclear.

 Dolphins and the Trade Laws 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The following editorial appeared in Friday's Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
Dolphins are protected by an American law that, according to a
panel of experts, violates the rules of international trade. This
decision will now accelerate the attacks on the revision of trade
rules that some 120 countries have negotiated and that Congress is
supposed to take up later this year. Some environmental organizations
will brandish the ruling to argue that trade agreements threaten to
undercut the environmental protection laws. Some conservatives will
use it to press their claim that the new trade agreement threatens
American sovereignty. Both are wrong. The dolphins are safe. This
trade agreement does not and cannot nullify American law on dolphins
or anything else.
</P>
<P>
But the United States may have to pay a price for enforcing this
law. Why, environmentalists angrily ask, should the country pay a
price for the privilege of doing good? Since this case is turning into
an ideological cause, it's worth a careful look.
</P>
<P>
Dolphins, in some parts of the Pacific, tend to swim above schools
of tuna. Commercial fishermen throw-or used to throw-vast nets around
the dolphins to get the tuna, killing all of them together. Congress
enacted legislation that not only outlawed that practice among
American fishermen but banned imports of foreign tuna caught that way.
It's the ban that violates the trade rules. The General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade says one country can't penalize goods from another
because of the way they were produced. Why? Because it creates much
too easy an opportunity to invent high-minded reasons for flagrant
protectionism. If there were an environmental exception, a lot of
European farmers would love to ban American wheat exports to Europe on
grounds that their American competitors benefit from a cheap oil
policy that encourages wasted resources and global warming. An
environmental exception would impose particularly high costs on the
world's largest exporter -- the United States.
</P>
<P>
As a result, if the dolphin decision survives appeal, the United
States will have to compensate the countries that are complaining. It
can give them trade concessions equal to the value of the tuna sales
they are losing.
</P>
<P>
There's also a better solution, and this case illustrates it. Two
years ago most of the countries that fish for tuna in the Pacific
agreed to protect the dolphins under a stringent schedule that will
push dolphin kills down close to zero by the end of the decade. At
that point, the trade issue will vanish. The world's environment will
be best protected by this kind of cooperation, not by trade fights.

 CBS on the Prowl to Replace 8 Stations Lost in Fox Raid (Hollywood) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
HOLLYWOOD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fox's historic raid on eight CBS affiliates this week
could cause serious problems for Paramount and Warner Bros. as they
try to launch their own fifth networks next year.
</P>
<P>
With CBS on the prowl to replace the affiliates it is losing in
such key markets as Detroit, Atlanta and Cleveland, those stations
that presently intend to align with Paramount's or the WB network have
become obvious targets, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
``Stations that were going to be a Paramount or WB affiliates now
have the option of going with CBS,'' said Matt Shapiro, a vice
president at MMT Sales Inc., who advises stations on programming.
``You have to assume that, given the choice, somebody is going to go
with an established network rather than a start-up.''
</P>
<P>
With the exception of Paramount's announcement that it would use
its spin-off ``Star Trek: Voyager'' series as the anchor for its
network, neither company has disclosed much about its programming
plans so far.
</P>
<P>
The Paramount Network, which is a joint venture with TV station
group Chris-Craft, plans to go on the air with two nights of
programming in January. WB is starting with one night and says it will
expand to two by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Paramount and Warner Bros. have been competing to sign up
independent TV stations around the country. So far Paramount has
aligned with 36 affiliates covering 47 percent of U.S. TV homes, and
WB has signed 22 affiliates along with cable TV channel WGN-TV that WB
says will give it exposure to 73 percent of all TV homes.
</P>
<P>
The problem is that there are only a limited number of TV stations
in every market, so that an affiliation swap can set off a chain
reaction of other switches. The smaller the market, the fewer the
available outlets and the more likely that a Paramout or WB affiliate
is at risk.
</P>
<P>
Each of the major broadcast networks has slightly more than 200
affiliates, but the top 30 markets account for 50 percent of all TV
households. Since the networks own the majority of affiliates in the
top 10 markets, the battleground will be in the 10th to 30th biggest
markets.
</P>
<P>
For example, in St. Louis (market No. 18), the ABC affiliate
KTVI-TV will become a Fox affiliate, forcing ABC to seek another
outlet in that market.
</P>
<P>
And in Phoenix (the 20th biggest market), WB has affiliated with
KPHO-TV. Paramount will partner with KUTP, which will not change since
the station is owned by its partner Chris-Craft. CBS affiliate KSAZ-TV
will become the Fox affiliate, leaving CBS the choice of picking up
former Fox partner KNXV-TV, which is on Channel 15, or going after the
more desirable KPHO-TV, Channel 5. Should CBS make a run on the ABC or
NBC affiliates, whichever network is dislodged would also likely go
after KPHO-TV before seeking the UHF independents in the market.
</P>
<P>
Jamie Kellner, the former president of Fox Broadcasting who was
integral in launching the fourth network and is now president of WB,
said fears that the Fox raid on CBS affiliates will affect either WB
or Paramount is ``silly.'' Kellner said the four other networks have
already picked off ``the best stations,'' and CBS will ``poach'' ABC
and NBC affiliates.
</P>
<P>
But the situation promises to get even more complicated in the
months ahead.
</P>
<P>
Fox Chairman Rupert Murdoch has told his station executives that he
wants VHF affiliates in all of the top 30 markets. Murdoch has been
trying to get Westinghouse to sell to Fox its TV stations in
Philadelphia, San Francisco and Baltimore -- all but one NBC affiliates
 -- but Westinghouse so far has refused. Some expect him to buy the
Philadelphia station, however.
</P>
<P>
And CBS, badly shaken by the surprise attack on its affiliates, was
rumored Thursday to be mounting a counter bid for Argyle Television
Holding Inc., part of the group of four TV stations that New World
Communications Group is assembling to own 12 Fox affiliates.
</P>
<P>
CBS Broadcast Group President Howard Stringer, while downplaying
the effect the raid would have on the network, said Thursday in a
meeting with reporters that CBS would consider investing minority
stakes in TV stations to secure affiliation agreements -- signaling the
affiliate wars are far from over.

 RECORDS: Capsule Reviews of Recent Releases 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forget about Fred and Barney. If you really want to gauge how
deeply the Flintstone phenomenon is ingrained on the American psyche,
sing a few bars of ``Meet the Flintstones'' and see how many people
join in. Even more impressive is the consistent quality of the other
music featured on the original TV show. Skim through ``The
Flintstones: Modern Stone-Age Melodies'' (Rhino 71649), and odds are
you'll know half the songs by heart, from the zippy ``Car Hop Song''
to the dippy ``Open Up Your Heart and Let the Sun Shine In.'' As such,
the real challenge facing the movie sound track ``The Flintstones:
Music from Bedrock'' (MCA 11045) is how to update the old songs
without losing their charm in the process. Frankly, it's harder than
it looks. Although the aptly renamed BC-52's try to get into the
spirit of the thing, their ``(Meet) the Flintstones'' owes more of its
charm to the vintage sound bites than to the overwrought yowling of
Kate Pierson and Fred Schneider. Worse, the only other songs on the
album that come close to being memorable are borrowed oldies like
``Walk the Dinosaur'' by Was Not Was or ``Weird Al'' Yankovic's
hysterical Red Hot Chili Peppers parody, ``Bedrock Anthem.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Because Erasure owes its reputation to a mix of synthesized soul
and over-the-top pop, it's hard to think of the duo as being
especially subtle; the campy tribute of ``Abba-esque'' seems far more
in character. But not only does ``I Say I Say I Say'' (Mute/Elektra
61633) bring an unexpected warmth to the group's
steady-as-a-second-hand pulse, it infuses the music with a genuinely
affecting romanticism. Naturally, much of that has to do with Andy
Bell's lusciously expressive singing, which adds an enormous amount of
heart to everything, from the warm, soaring chorus of ``Always'' to
the soulful strains of ``Take Me Back.'' But it's Vince Clarke's canny
electronics that ultimately carry the day, softening techno-edged
groove of ``Run to the Sun'' and filling ``Blues Away'' with such
warmth that it's easy to forget he's doing it all with synthesizers. A
revelation.
</P>
<P>
-0- 
</P>
<P>
There's no denying that Heavy D and the Boyz command the respect of
their peers, but is it really necessary to open ``Nuttin' But Love''
(MCA/Uptown 10998) with five minutes of famous friends paying their
respects? A far better start would be to jump straight to the sassy,
bass-driven groove of ``Sex Wit You'' and take the album from there.
True, the Heavster does rely a tad too much on the tried-and-true
here, stressing his good-guy image and playing ``The Overweight
Lover'' to the hilt. But just as ``Something Goin' On'' puts a fresh
spin on the ``Heartbeat'' bassline or ``Got Me Waiting'' manages to
reinvent Luther Vandross' ``Don't You Know That,'' the best moments
here are entertaining despite their seeming conservatism.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
If all Collective Soul had to offer on ``Hints Allegations and
Things Left Unsaid'' (Atlantic 82596) was ``Shine,'' the band's debut
would be well worth the money. Artfully combining the moody drama of
post-R.E.M. Southern rock with the over-amped grit of grunge,
``Shine'' is a pop gem, the sort of single you hear once in the
morning and end up humming all day. But there's more to the album than
that. ``Love Lifted Me'' shows what the band learned from the Beatles
songbook, ``Heaven's Already Here'' is a pleasant throwback to the
singer/songwriter era, and ``Goodnight, Good Guy'' roars in with a
powerhouse chorus and an instantly memorable guitar hook. Granted, the
rest is mostly filler, but on the whole, it's a better beginning than
most.

 POP FACES: After Years Rocking Cradle, Hynde Has Room to Rock Herself 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chrissie Hynde is afraid some people might have the wrong idea
about her. She's worried that they might have heard stories about her
being a hard-nosed, domineering control freak -- or, worse, taken them
as fact.
</P>
<P>
They're not. The leader of the Pretenders may be a lot of things -- 
feisty, plain-spoken, irreverent, even politically incorrect -- but a
control freak? Not hardly.
</P>
<P>
``I don't want to control my life, I want my life to control me,''
she says, over the phone from the New York offices of her record
company. ``I've always believed that if I allow my life to control me,
then I can experience a great deal more than if I think that I'm on
top of it and I set my own agenda from year to year.''
</P>
<P>
That agenda doesn't always have to do with the usual rock 'n' roll
priorities, either. At the moment, Hynde is in full road-mode, happily
promoting her band's new album and eager to start playing gigs again.
But ``Last of the Independents'' is only the Pretenders' second new
album since 1987, while this current outing marks the band's first
tour in eight years.
</P>
<P>
``I've had other things to do for that eight years,'' she says, a
mite defensively. ``It hasn't even been an option.''
</P>
<P>
She doesn't elaborate -- at least not right away. But as the
conversation ambles on, she eventually admits that her chief priority
for much of that time was to stay home and be a good mother to her two
daughters.
</P>
<P>
``The last time I was on tour, I had two infants in baskets,'' she
says. ``There was the coach with the band, and then there was the
coach with me and the kids. I can't sleep in a coach, over night, but
the kids could. So that would mean that by 8 o'clock in the morning,
I'd already be totally irritable, jarred, jangled from driving and
having done a show and not sleeping. And then Mary Poppins would come
on. You know? Not my idea of a rock tour.''
</P>
<P>
So Hynde just ``chilled out altogether, and attended to my first
consideration, which was looking after my children. But now I'm freed
up. I can kind of do it a little bit. So I'm delighted.
</P>
<P>
``I mean, I adore my children above all else. Of course I do. But
I've got to rock.''
</P>
<P>
She pauses a second, and then adds, ominously, ``But (the children)
have nothing to do with it. You won't see them or hear from them.
Nobody gets to meet them. Nobody has to know their name and who they
are. And if anyone tries to ... '' Hynde stops, trying to think up an
appropriate threat.
</P>
<P>
``Well, I suggest just don't.''
</P>
<P>
Advice taken.
</P>
<P>
Hynde admits that it's a ticklish situation for her to be in.
``It's a package,'' she says. ``They come with me, in many ways. But
they're, you know ... ''
</P>
<P>
Of course, nobody ever said being a rock 'n' roll grown-up would be
easy. There are times, Hynde says, when she worries that others might
find her enthusiasm for the music a tad unseemly for someone her age.
But she's certainly not going to let that stop her.
</P>
<P>
``I'm in my 40s, and I love it more than ever,'' she enthuses. ``So
I will enjoy it. I'll still go out and buy pop papers. No one can stop
me, it's not illegal. If I want to say I love Urge Overkill and
everyone turns around and says, `Well, you're retarded,' fine. So be
it. Allow me to be a rock 'n' roll retard for the rest of my life.
</P>
<P>
``Bear in mind that, after all, I am just a girl from Akron, Ohio.
Like, I'm nobody. And I can now stay in hotels in New York and
stuff?'' She laughs, clearly delighted. ``I mean, my friends in Akron
can't go and stay in a hotel in New York and just hang out and do the
things that I do. They have to like, get to work in the morning and
stuff. I caught the gold ring, man.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
That's one reason she doesn't mind many of the impositions that
come with rock stardom. ``When I'm asked to sign autographs and people
say, `isn't that a pain?' I say, `No.' When I write my name down on
that piece of paper, I'm signing a contract in my own mind that says,
`You do not have to go to work tomorrow. Sign here.'
</P>
<P>
``I love this stuff,'' she continues. ``And I've learned the art of
pulling back and getting out of it as soon as it starts seeming a
little bit monotonous, as soon as it starts feeling like a career. I
don't want to make it sound that I'm so superficial that I can say
that it's all just good fun, don't take it seriously, because I've
never met a musician who doesn't take it very seriously.
</P>
<P>
``But it is entertainment, after all. And I've decided that if I'm
going to be in entertainment, then I want to be entertained, too.''

 Beastie Boys Mature as Band, Expand Horizons With Magazine 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Back when the Beastie Boys first bum-rushed the popular
consciousness, their detractors wanted to write them off as loudmouths
with a lot of attitude but little real talent. Most figured the trio
would be forgotten as soon as ``Fight for Your Right (To Party)'' fell
off the charts.
</P>
<P>
Guess again. Eight years later, the Beasties remain a force to be
reckoned with, having expanded their horizons to include everything
from a genre-jumping live show to a burgeoning media empire.
</P>
<P>
Start with the musical end. Although a growing number of rap acts
now work with a live band, the Beasties are among the few that
actually are a band, an approach the Beasties used heavily on the 1992
album ``Check Your Head.''
</P>
<P>
``When we made `Check Your Head,' we were just coming off having
not played our instruments for a while,'' explains bassist Adam
``MCA'' Yauch, over the phone from a tour stop in Toronto. ``So it was
all real new. But after we toured a lot, we got a lot more comfortable
playing together as a band, with our percussion player and our
keyboard player and everything. Things started jelling a little bit
more.
</P>
<P>
``So when we went back into the studio to record the new album, it
came a lot more naturally. It just happens a little easier when you're
playing together more.''
</P>
<P>
That album, ``Ill Communication'' (which arrives in stores
Tuesday), doesn't just benefit from a tighter band; it also boasts the
sort of stylistic prowess that allows the Beasties to move easily from
rock to punk to old-school funk.
</P>
<P>
Making music isn't the only thing the Beasties do these days,
however. Among other things, the trio has launched its own magazine,
Grand Royal. Although much of its content is music-oriented, the
magazine is hardly as narrowly focused as mainstream periodicals, such
as Spin or Vibe, as stories on George Clinton and the Pharcyde sit
cheek by jowl with items on Bruce Lee, Joey Buttafuoco and Kiss.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
``I'm surprised at how homogenized mainstream press is,'' says
Yauch. ``It's really directed at this one, watered-down thing that
they think everyone's interested in. I think that you need a little
bit more of a personal touch on a lot of the stuff that's going out
these days.''
</P>
<P>
Part of that personal touch for Yauch is coverage of the political
and cultural situation in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
``My personal feeling about it is that their approach to life and
their way of understanding reality is well in advance of most Western
understanding,'' he says. ``And one of the main reasons I think it's
such an important issue is 'cause, if we don't get our approach to
technology in check pretty soon, we're going to destroy the planet. I
see Westerners as really immature, with a lot of dangerous toys. If we
don't get our minds and thinking in check, we'll basically blow up the
planet.
</P>
<P>
``So it seems like a good time to turn to the Tibetans.''

 Astro Bigger Than Chrysler Minivans but Doesn't Handle as Well 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a decade ago, in the early days of America's love affair
with the minivan, that General Motors launched the Astro to compete
against Chrysler Corp.'s then nearly new Voyager and Caravan.
</P>
<P>
Like the Ford Aerostar that arrived about the same time, the Astro
is bigger than the Chrysler but never was serious competition for it.
</P>
<P>
The success of the Chryslers, you see, was based not just on their
ability to carry everything including the kitchen sink, but to do
that and still ride comfortably and handle well enough to please
people who don't much like driving trucks.
</P>
<P>
The extended Astro, which is about 10 inches longer than the
standard version, can carry about 20 cubic feet more stuff than the
standard Astro, and 30 cubic feet more stuff than a stretched
Chrysler, assuming all three vehicles have their second and third rows
of seating removed.
</P>
<P>
An Astro can tow a 5,500-pound trailer, 2,000 pounds heavier than
any Chrysler will pull. So the Astro and nearly identical GMC Safari
offer impressive advantages for a very reasonable price; our tester,
packed with comfort and convenience options, listed for $24,289, with
freight.
</P>
<P>
The price one pays, unfortunately, for the Astro's more trucklike
capabilities is a jouncier ride and clumsier handling than is provided
by the Chryslers -- or GM's own Lumina/TransSport/Silhouette line, for
that matter -- despite chassis refinements for '94.
</P>
<P>
Although we'd rate the handling superior to that of any full-sized
van, there's more sway in cornering, more body shake and more rear
axle hop on bumps than in the smaller minivans -- adding up to a sense
of being less in control than you'd like when traffic and road
conditions are challenging.
</P>
<P>
Back on the plus side, the all-wheel drive, costing $2,300, is a
modern, full-time system.
</P>
<P>
No complaints about the engine, either; even with a four-passenger
load, hundreds of pounds of cargo, and the air conditioner going, it
did an impressive job of maintaining speed on long interstate upgrades
and of keeping itself cool. The automatic transmission works smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Our tester's four, extra-cost bucket seats proved comfortable even
after several hours of driving. Controls and displays are
well-designed, although sun glare sometimes makes the gauges difficult
to read.
</P>
<P>
Our tester's ``dutch door'' tailgate, also at extra cost, is handy
for loading in close quarters. The window hinges up, then the rest of
the gate opens to the left and right in two sections.
</P>
<P>
Standard-length Astros with rear-wheel drive begin at about $17,000
with a 165-horsepower V-6.

 Nissan's Maxima -- Spoiling for a Fight 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nissan makes au fait sedans for younger families and naughtier
coupes for the higher spirited who take their driving seriously.
</P>
<P>
Bouncing between both demands, capable of romping or simply
strolling through life, has been Nissan's Maxima.
</P>
<P>
Visually ... it's a four-door sedan.
</P>
<P>
Physically ... it's a high-ceilinged sports car with a performance
legacy that began in 1980 with an engine borrowed from the 240Z sports
car.
</P>
<P>
Realistically ... well, more than 90 percent of Nissan's car sales
are of socially acceptable sedans: Altima, Maxima and Sentra. The
company's sporty coupes, the 240SX and the 300ZX, remain toys for a
gymnastic minority.
</P>
<P>
And as the high energies and fine handling of 130-mph four-doors
such as Toyota Camry, Ford Taurus, Honda Accord and Chrysler's first
family of LH cars become silky norms, the demand for sedans that snarl
is no more.
</P>
<P>
So the 1995 Maxima was built to paddle steadily toward the
mainstream of mid-size.
</P>
<P>
The legacy of every car in the new Maxima lineup remains hearty
handling and V-6 athleticism. But they move with a quieter step while
handling the irritations of traffic and road surfaces with higher
sophistication. There's even a maxi Maxima, all wood-trimmed elegance,
lustered upper crust and puffy-leather softness very suggestive of
Infiniti luxury.
</P>
<P>
It takes, however, more than better mechanicals and Ritz-Carlton
interiors to buck the best of today's market.
</P>
<P>
So Maxima, depending on the model, is priced between $700 and
$2,500 lower than last year. More significant of the tussle ahead,
they cost $900 to $2,000 less than the intended target: the V-6 Toyota
Camry.
</P>
<P>
Honda's Accord still has the edge on price -- but even 1995 versions
do not offer a V-6 engine.
</P>
<P>
Ford Taurus underprices Maxima -- but its V-6 is skinnier by 50
horsepower.
</P>
<P>
From two trim levels of last year, Maxima has advanced to three
with the addition being that kinder, gentler, plushier sedan with a
price tickling the velvet tootsies of Mercedes C-Class.
</P>
<P>
From a choice of two V-6s, Maxima has mellowed its power source to
one lighter, more compact, double cam, 3.0-liter engine. It still
produces 190 horsepower but runs cleaner, more economically and
produces heftier torque.
</P>
<P>
If bargain basements are your lifestyle, the Maxima GXE with manual
transmission is your car and costs $19,999. Those nines, of course,
fool no one because base prices conveniently exclude unavoidable
taxes, registration and destination charges. So get real and figure on
more than $21,000 with an additional $999 -- or $1,000 to be on the
safe side -- for a four-speed automatic.
</P>
<P>
Ample goodies are standard on the GXE and include dual air bags,
air conditioning, cruise control, power windows and steering, rear
window defroster, cut pile carpets, dual mirrors and courtesy lighting
from trunk to ashtray.
</P>
<P>
Next in line at $20,999 -- or $22,000 with all the hidden bits -- is
the manual-transmission Maxima SE. This is a chariot for the warmer of
blood who understand the real benefits of stiffened shocks, firmer
struts and stickier tires. Also for those who believe that a
leather-wrapped steering wheel, body-colored door handles, rear-deck
spoiler, polished wheels and driving gloves are synonymous with speedy
progress.
</P>
<P>
Then there's the Maxima GLE, our test car, which, if not the lap of
lady luxury, certainly lounges at her feet.
</P>
<P>
The sticker of $24,199 -- c'mon, work out the true price among
yourselves -- includes needless, therefore desirable, luxuries that are
native customs on European cars. Such as leather seats, bun warmers,
heated mirrors and a Bose compact disc sound system that will rupture
eardrums two cars over. There is key-less entry, a thinking climate
control, an automatic security system and other programs aimed at one
day rendering the human touch obsolete.
</P>
<P>
Anti-lock brakes are a $995 option throughout the line.
</P>
<P>
Strangely, Maxima styling, sketched by Nissan Design International
in San Diego, is a flop. Head-on, the three-lip grille with
blacked-out mesh is a dark smirk from Morticia Addams. The car stands
a little high, almost perching. The rear shrieks of Toyota Corolla.
</P>
<P>
Heads do not turn at Maxima's passage simply because in silhouette
it makes only one positive statement: This is just another Japanese
car.
</P>
<P>
The GLE's interior has much more to say and, again, Infiniti is the
language being spoken. Leather-faced seats are soft quality with a
magnificent, eight-way driver's chair that would adjust to Gumby.
Walnut trim on the dashboard, center console and arm rests is deep and
rich, albeit fake. And the switch gear works in deep whispers, not
harsh clicks.
</P>
<P>
These are comfortable, friendly accommodations with understated
touches to prevent luxury from becoming intimidating.
</P>
<P>
Spaciousness, as Casey Stengel might have allowed, is everywhere.
Thanks to a longer wheelbase and compact suspension, cabin height has
been improved until front-seat occupants no longer need open the sun
roof for additional headroom. There's more leg, knee and shoulder
space in the back seats.
</P>
<P>
But a hand brake set to the right of the driver's seat and barely
three inches from the face of the console is an exercise in
clumsiness. It needs relocating, at least shortening to keep from
rasping and gouging a driver's knee.
</P>
<P>
Alarm and central locking controls -- including remote-control
opening of front windows to release solar-basted summer air -- work
flawlessly. Also silently. A clearly audible chirp or kerchunk would
be a better way of advising a departing owner that the Maxima is armed
and secure.
</P>
<P>
Performance remains Maxima's might. It is not improved radically
but has certainly been burnished carefully into a smoother, tighter,
less strenuous package.

 Book World Booting Up for a Whole New Chapter (Los Angeles) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LOS ANGELES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like surfers waiting for the next wave, booksellers
are an anxious bunch these days. They know a big one is coming, they
just don't know where or when.
</P>
<P>
From coast to coast, the book biz is abuzz with talk of a brave new
computerized world. In the future, some experts predict, a
tsunami-force wave of CD-ROM technology and other innovations will
wash through U.S. bookstores, dramatically transforming the way texts
are written, packaged, sold and read.
</P>
<P>
Within years, they suggest, books will be more than hard-bound
bestsellers or mass-market paperbacks. They'll be three-dimensional,
sensory experiences on home computer screens that usher in a new era
of literary information. You'll just pop in a compact disk, turn on
the laptop ... and read.
</P>
<P>
Few are predicting the demise of books as we know them, because
it's hard to imagine your PowerBook at the beach, or bedtime stories
with the kids in front of an impersonal computer. But in a nation
where 32 percent of all homes have PCs, the demand for electronic book
products could become insatiable.
</P>
<P>
``There's a change coming and we have to stake our claim to this
new market,'' says Doug Dutton, owner of a Dutton's Books in Los
Angeles. ``Yet that's all we know. We booksellers have a lot of
questions about where we're headed.''
</P>
<P>
They'll be seeking answers starting Saturday, when more than 30,000
publishers, authors, booksellers, agents and other vendors gather in
Los Angeles for the annual American Booksellers Association
convention. The four-day event is the largest book conference in the
English-speaking world.
</P>
<P>
Much of the informal buzz is expected to focus on electronic
publishing, a relatively new branch of the book business that's
gathering more force each year. For the first time, the ABA will be
devoting a sizable chunk of convention floor space to computer book
products. The market has clearly grabbed sellers' attention -- but will
they be able to ride the new wave?
</P>
<P>
``That's the $64,000 question,'' says Elisa Zachary, publisher of
Simon Schuster's interactive division, which is less than a year
old. ``You have to train people to sell these products, and consumers
have to become more aware. Maybe they've heard about electronic books.
But they don't know much more.''
</P>
<P>
On the surface, it looks simple: CD-ROM technology records the text
of a book on compact disk to be read on a computer screen. The
experience is often enhanced with sound, graphics and material not
found in the original book.
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic feature of the new product, however, is
interactive: It enables people to ``talk back'' to the text with the
mere click of a computer switch. From a creative standpoint, the
possibilities are endless.
</P>
<P>
In a future CD-ROM book, for example, readers could step into a
novel, invent characters and change plots. The technology already
exists for kids to watch Velociraptors crossing a Mongolian plain, as
they click their way through a book about dinosaurs. History has been
enhanced for many college students, who now can look up Hitler, Lenin
or Stalin in an on-line encyclopedia and see grainy films of them
delivering speeches on home computer screens.
</P>
<P>
Publishers are calling it the ultimate marriage of reading and
entertainment. But they caution that electronic books and their ilk
are like many other futuristic products rolling down the new
information superhighway.
</P>
<P>
``Right now it's all talk and speculation,'' says a high-ranking
executive of a major American booksellers chain. ``Everybody knows the
potential here is going to be vast and huge ... but it's up to
consumers to make this fly.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are only a limited number of CD-ROM book products
on the market, ranging from the complete Oxford English Dictionary to
a group of children's stories, including ``Just Grandma and Me,''
which has sold more than 130,000 copies. Customers seeking them out in
bookstores may be disappointed because many stores don't yet carry a
full product line.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, CD-ROM books are more typically found in computer stores
such as Egghead Software and Comp USA. Booksellers hope to correct
that so they don't lose the market. And publishers are also feeling
the heat, because they don't want to merely provide the back list of
material for others to re-create on CD-ROM. For them, the big bucks
will be in marketing and distribution.
</P>
<P>
``We're rethinking what it means to be a publisher, and we're
trying to move as many products on paper into electronics,'' says
Randi Benton, who runs the interactive computer division of Random
House Inc. ``But everybody has to proceed cautiously, because there
are some obvious business concerns.''
</P>
<P>
Such as: How do you bet the farm on a new medium when fewer than 5
million American homes have CD-ROM technology in their computers? Will
enough customers buy electronic books that typically sell for $69.99
or more?
</P>
<P>
Most important, what happens if compact disk technology becomes the
eight-track tape of the 1990s -- an obsolete hardware that's overtaken
by new gadgetry?
</P>
<P>
``I don't think it really matters that much,'' says Bob Stein, a
creative guru at the Voyager Co., a New York-based company that
creates CD-ROM books. ``Did the Beatles suffer when eight-track tapes
gave way to cassettes? They did just fine and so did their audience.
The point is, change will happen.
</P>
<P>
``You're entering a whole new world. Reading used to be something
where you only used one of five senses, but now at least we've added a
second, which is hearing. We've enlarged the band width, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
``And we're going to see a time when many writers no longer just
rely on the printed page to communicate. They'll be using the computer
as a larger locus of expression. That's where you'll find our
forward-looking writers.''
</P>
<P>
The new technology also permits a richer look at the past. In the
recently published diaries of Richard Nixon presidential aide H.R.
Haldeman, for example, readers of the printed book can thumb through
684 pages of text. But the CD-ROM version just issued by Sony
Electronics includes an expanded text as well as 45 minutes of rare
home movies of Nixon shot by Haldeman.
</P>
<P>
Booksellers are watching and waiting to see how the new medium
performs, but there are some preliminary indications it will be quite
popular.
</P>
<P>
Bernard Rath, ABA executive director, notes that the introduction
of on-line encyclopedias has caused a 10 percent to 12 percent dip in
sales of printed versions.
</P>
<P>
``It would be a shame if we don't seize the advantage and get in
the forefront of this,'' he says. ``Our goal is to make the bookstore
perceived as the place to go for information or entertainment in any
format.''
</P>
<P>
And the place to start, many say, is with kids.
</P>
<P>
It's no accident that Random House is emphasizing children's
products in its initial CD-ROM ventures. Next year, Dr. Seuss' works
will be available on disk, through a joint venture with Random House
and Broderbund.
</P>
<P>
This fall, Simon Schuster will market a Star Trek junkies' dream
 -- the operating manual for the USS Enterprise in a bold new computer
format, replete with interactive gizmos, color graphics and vivid
sound effects.
</P>
<P>
``Kids are sponges with computers,'' Random House's Benton says.
``They absorb this stuff completely, with no fear. They have no
barriers. So they're a natural place for the first waves of this new
medium to start appearing.''

 VIDEO LOG: `Menace' on Laser Disc -- True Grit and Urban Gore 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Watching and listening to filmmakers Allen and Albert Hughes talk
about their debut 1993 feature film, ``Menace II Society,'' on a new
Criterion laser disc ($100) takes commitment and a strong stomach.
</P>
<P>
First, there is the raw film itself, seen for the first time in an
unrated director's cut. From the unsparing, ``Sunset Blvd.''-style
opening to the literal closing shot of ``Menace II Society,'' there is
little question of the film's resolution: violent death amid grinding
hopelessness.
</P>
<P>
Then there is the special supplementary material on this jam-packed
laser disc in which each identical twin is given his own analog sound
track. To hear what they have to say about the making of ``Menace,''
you have to watch the film play out twice to give each brother a
chance to explain, scene by grueling scene, how their bold vision was
put on film.
</P>
<P>
There is little doubt that we're in the presence of two young,
uncompromising filmmakers with much potential. The Hughes brothers
were 20 when they co-directed ``Menace II Society,'' a film whose
story they say they had thought about since they were 15.
</P>
<P>
The Criterion laser edition leaves almost nothing out: In addition
to the unrated film featuring material deleted from the theatrical
release and the two audio commentaries, the package includes the
original theatrical trailer; two deleted scenes dropped in the final
cut; two music videos directed by the Hughes brothers; excerpts from
Albert Hughes' Los Angeles City College student film, ``The Drive
By,'' and the short, ``Menace to Society''; a video interview with the
Hugheses; storyboards and storyboard-to-film comparison of key action
sequences, and other production notes and documentation.
</P>
<P>
In this home theater version, ``Menace'' unwinds with all the
graphic violence that the MPAA insisted be removed to avoid an NC-17
rating. Even more than in the movie theater, the assault on the senses
in the comfort of your living room amplifies the harsh realities of
this corner of urban life: young men living a nasty, short and brutish
``gangsta'' existence seemingly handed down from generation to
generation, with little done to break the cycle.
</P>
<P>
For some, the raw language and bullets tearing apart bodies may be
too much; for others, it may simply underscore the film's point, in
Allen's words: ``The whole idea of the movie was to make people
understand; we wanted people to know what they're thinking.'' And, he
cautions, ``People shouldn't read too deep into this movie. We just
wanted to make a movie that had some kind of morality.''
</P>
<P>
Albert says black audiences often had less trouble dealing with the
violent subject matter than white audiences: ``They know it's just a
film,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
(``Menace II Society,'' without supplementary material and deleted
scenes, is also available in a letterboxed, single-disc CLV edition
from Image Entertainment at $35.)
</P>
<P>
-0- 
</P>
<P>
GROTESQUE CARNAGE: ``Man Bites Dog,'' the 1992 French film by Remy
Belvaux, Andre Bonzel and Benoit Poelvoorde, offers even more
grotesque carnage than ``Menace'' in a director-approved Criterion
edition ($50) that includes disgusting scenes excised by censors. An
interview with the filmmakers at the end of the single disc makes the
point that ``it's not a film about violence, it's a film about
filmmaking.''
</P>
<P>
Shot in black-and-white with a hand-held camera as a document of
the life and mind of a sociopathic killer, it's been hailed as a
sendup of reality-based docudrama films. Liner notes by Holly Willis
also argue that assailing the film for its brutality ``completely
misses the film's point.'' That may be so, but it is hard to find much
redemption in this unrelenting series of murders and graphic rape, and
even harder to watch for its full 92 minutes. There is little humanity
involved here. In fact, ``Man Bites Dog'' makes ``Menace II Society''
look tame by comparison.

 VIDEO LOG: An Invasion of WWII Videos on Tap 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Look for the interest in old World Mar II movies to skyrocket in
the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
The inspiration is the celebration of the 50th anniversary of
D-day, the Allied invasion of Normandy June 6, 1944. Home-video
retailers will be showcasing classic war movies to capitalize both on
the media attention and the Father's Day's gift potential.
</P>
<P>
The tape that's getting the most attention is FoxVideo's ``The
Longest Day,'' which just came out for the first time in a colorized
version -- priced at $25 and featuring some Movietone newsreel footage
of the invasion. This 1962 movie, probably the most elaborate war epic
ever filmed, actually works better in color -- adding grandeur that's
missing from the black-and-white version. It includes nearly every
male star of that era -- from John Wayne and Robert Mitchum to Sal
Mineo.
</P>
<P>
FoxVideo also repackaged two other movies. One is another
first-rate but less heralded film about the Normandy invasion, ``D-Day
The Sixth of June,'' made in 1956 and starring Robert Taylor. Priced
at $15, it also includes newsreel footage. The other is 1970's
``Patton,'' featuring George C. Scott's Oscar-winning performance in
the title role, at $30.
</P>
<P>
The hidden gem in this repackaged collection is ``Twelve O'Clock
High,'' about American pilots in England during World War II.
War-movie buffs love this 1949 movie, which has been hard to find in
recent years. It stars Gregory Peck.

JACKIE TAPES: As you might expect, there are some Jackie Onassis
videos on the way. Turner Home Entertainment, which markets CNN
footage, is first out of the box with a video homage to the late first
lady -- ``Jackie: A Life'' (Turner, $20). You can order by mail, (800)
799-7676, or wait until it shows up in stores in about a month. Turner
is an old hand at rush-releasing tapes. A few weeks ago, it marketed
``Richard Nixon: A Retrospective'' just after he died, for $20, but
through mail order only -- that same 800 number.
</P>
<P>
Onassis' death spurred New Horizons Video to change the release
date of ``A Woman Named Jackie,'' the 1992 ABC miniseries starring
Roma Downey in the title role. Originally scheduled for July 20, it's
now coming out June 15. Surprisingly, this three-tape set isn't
bargain-priced for the sales market but will be available as a rental
only.

 Who Will Keep the Liberal Flame Burning, If Not Breyer? 
 Reinhardt is a judge on the U.S. 9th Circuit Court 
 of Appeals in Los Angeles. 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is intended as a personal appeal to a colleague and friend,
Supreme Court nominee Stephen Breyer.
</P>
<P>
There are so many people who desperately need your understanding
and compassion. The sad truth is that you are not only succeeding
Harry Blackmun. You are the only potential successor to William
Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, Earl Warren, William O. Douglas and the
whole line of humanitarian justices who understood the importance of
compassion and the need to do justice, not just administer law. There
are lots of able technicians who understand law. The nation, however,
is entitled to at least one justice with vision, with breadth, with
idealism, with -- to say the word despised in the Clinton
administration -- a ``liberal'' philosophy and an expansive approach to
jurisprudence. Someone must carry on the work of the court's great
progressive thinkers -- the justices who ended ``de jure'' racial
segregation, brought us one man/one vote, opened the courts to the
poor and needy, established the right to counsel for all defendants,
gave women true legal equality. It was progressive justices with a
view of the Constitution as a living, breathing document who gave full
measure to that instrument -- not the legal technocrats, not those
whose view of the Constitution was frozen as of 1789.
</P>
<P>
You have a wonderful opportunity and an awesome responsibility. You
can be a narrow, cramped proceduralist like Felix Frankfurter, or you
can seize the occasion and grow like a Warren, a Brennan, a Blackmun.
You can be cold, purely intellectual and wholly technical, or you can
become what the president said he was looking for -- a justice who is
compassionate, who has a big heart.
</P>
<P>
I hope you will re-examine your judicial philosophy. Everyone who
goes on the court should. And when you emerge, I hope it will be to
assume the mantle of the Brennan-Warren legacy. Otherwise, that voice
will be silenced -- perhaps permanently. How ironic if that would be
the enduring consequence of electing a president supported so strongly
by the poor, the needy, minorities of all kinds.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, I am most hopeful for the court and the country with you
there. Perhaps I'm influenced by my personal feelings, but I believe
that you will not let the spirit of liberalism be extinguished, that
you will be a strong voice for a philosophy that now has no other
means of expression. It simply cannot be otherwise -- not after all
that your spiritual predecessors have fought and struggled for,
including the marvelous and caring justice for whom you clerked,
Arthur Goldberg. You represent an awful lot of hopes, dreams and
aspirations -- a vision of a nation. For better or for worse, those who
depend on the court to protect their fundamental rights must now look
to you. You are their best and last hope.
</P>
<P>
As I listened to the minority leader of the Senate say, ``He's not
as liberal as Blackmun,'' and as I heard Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah,
express his joy over your selection, I thought of how important it is
to have scruples and convictions and to stick by them. How I hope that
those who disdain the expansive and humanitarian philosophy of the
Warren/Brennan court have misread you.
</P>
<P>
Conservatives who fight for what they believe in deserve respect
and admiration. It is hard to have those feelings for others who are
easily intimidated, who fear controversy, who care only about
compromise and consensus or their own success. There are plenty of
centrists around. They now represent the left of the court. While I
rarely agree with Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, I respect him.
When he was appointed to the court, he was a lone voice for a judicial
philosophy of the right. He was regularly on the short end of 8-1
votes, but he spoke for an important point of view and he almost
single-handedly kept alive the principles in which he believed. They
now dominate our judicial thinking. I don't expect you to be that
successful, but at least give us a voice.
</P>
<P>
The court has lots of intellect. While you will add to it, Justice
Antonin Scalia represents abstract rationality well enough. But soul
is important too. That is what makes greatness.

 ROSENBERG ON TV: Johnny Hits the Spot With `Favorite' Tapes 
 Howard Rosenberg 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
HOLLYWOOD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What are talk shows if not collections of fleeting
moments -- some of which are delectable, most of which run together
like a monotone buzz that you listen to without really hearing? Drop
the buzz, keep the highlights and you really have something. So. ...
</P>
<P>
He-e-e-e-e-re's ``Johnny Carson: His Favorite Moments from `The
Tonight Show.' ''
</P>
<P>
Carson has described his nearly 30 years of bending America's ear
as ``just a helluva lot of fun.'' That also applies to this four-tape
set from Buena Vista Home Video. It goes on sale Friday, ironically
just as Carson's once-energized competitor -- Arsenio Hall -- is ending
his own, skimpier run as a late-night host.
</P>
<P>
Nothing gets more inflated than a eulogy. Celebs have been dropping
by the syndicated ``Arsenio'' in advance of Friday night's finale to
assure him that he's a giant of entertainment who will be widely
missed. Carson heard much the same thing in 1992 during his last days,
and, three decades earlier, so did the man Carson succeeded on ``The
Tonight Show,'' Jack Paar.
</P>
<P>
Judging by his dive in the Nielsen ratings, though, Hall's
departure has been preceded by a fade to anonymity. The ``indelible''
memory of Paar lasted only as long as it took Carson to launch his
first one-liner. And the worshiped Carson himself -- despite his
enormous impact as a television icon and a thread of continuity during
momentous change in the United States -- was missed only a little
longer. Like television itself, we're creatures of the moment with
short memories. There are just too many distractions.
</P>
<P>
As TV-driven zombies, most of us are easily diverted by bells,
whistles or any other loud noises. Nothing has been noisier of late
than the duel of television's late-night commandos, Jay Leno and David
Letterman. On CBS, ``Late Show With David Letterman'' has been a true
phenomenon, and Leno on NBC has at at times creatively used ``The
Tonight Show'' to tap sources of humor distinct from the late-night
talk and comedy of the Carson era.
</P>
<P>
Just how distinct is evident from watching the Carson tapes, which,
says an accompanying publicity blurb, will be the only video
retrospective of his show to be released. The first three tapes can be
purchased separately ($15 each), but you have to buy the entire set
for $60 to get the fourth tape, which is Carson's final ``Tonight
Show,'' broadcast two years ago this week.
</P>
<P>
The tapes -- opening with ``The Tonight Show'' originating from New
York in black and white -- are a kick on several levels, one of which
is historical. In only a few moments you're returned to an earlier
universe in which such names as Ethel Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey
surface in Carson's monologues, and smoking was still the nasty habit
of the TV multitudes (Buddy Hackett, Flip Wilson, Dean Martin, George
Gobel and the host himself are seen blithely puffing away).
</P>
<P>
And who is that androgynous falsetto freak that we see a
bowled-over, can't-believe-his-eyes-or-ears Carson greeting in 1968?
Why, it's none other than Tiny Tim. Yet he looks as quaint as a sweet
old aunt and as mainstream as Peoria compared to 1994's Prince or
Michael Jackson.
</P>
<P>
Most of the ``moments'' are in the
still-funny-after-all-these-years category.
</P>
<P>
There is Carson in 1968 face-to-face with Jack Webb in a
``Dragnet''-style stone-faced talking-heads dialogue about a ``Copper
Clapper Caper'' that could have been pulled from a contemporary police
parody; then a decade later as Mister Rogers, using mommy and daddy
dolls to explain the birds and bees. And there he is spoofing George
C. Scott's Gen. Patton, giving a stirring speech in front of an
enormous U.S. flag. When the camera pulls back, you see that he's been
speaking to Girl Scouts.
</P>
<P>
What strikes you, though, is just how little time is devoted to
traditional interviews, almost as an admission that the bulk of them
were too forgettable to earn a shot at posterity. Instead, Carson
affirms here that he not only was a hair-trigger ad-libber but also
was someone adept at shaping cleverly written material into hilarious
physical comedy, whether as fast-talking movie host Art Fern or as
all-knowing, all-seeing Carnac the Magnificent (``Piggly wiggly:
Describe Kermit's wedding night'').
</P>
<P>
You particularly appreciate just how gifted and instinctive he was
as a physical comic when he elasticizes his gangly body when he comes
under attack from the various exotic insects and animals brought on
the show by Joan Embery, Jim Fowler and others.
</P>
<P>
The tapes also showcase a slew of young stand-ups -- including Leno,
Letterman and Garry Shandling -- before they became major stars. In
fact, all of Carson's hosts-in-waiting are memorialized here. Well,
almost all.
</P>
<P>
Johnny holds a grudge so long. ...
</P>
<P>
How long?
</P>
<P>
So long that former Carson favorite Joan Rivers -- who reportedly
angered him deeply when she bolted ``The Tonight Show'' for her own
competing late-night series on Fox in 1986 -- is a non-person on these
tapes.
</P>
<P>
The emotional heart of ``His Favorite Moments'' is not the sign-off
show -- a no-guest, anticlimactic sprawl of clips and various bits of
nostalgia -- but the famous next-to-last show that included a visibly
moved Carson being serenaded by Bette Midler. It was a lovely,
lingering, moist-eyed instant of television that seemed to belie the
fact that, for nearly all its life under Carson, ``The Tonight Show''
was nothing more than fluff. Which, of course, is why we watched it.

 A Few Minutes With Author Judith Krantz (New York) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Judith Krantz's success with commercial novels rich in
steamy sex and glamorous excess began in 1978 with her maiden effort,
``Scruples,'' the story of a swank boutique. ``Scruples Two'' came six
books later, followed by the new ``Lovers'' (Crown), a discrete
conclusion to her trilogy that has more than 400,000 copies in print
and will spawn an ABC miniseries.
</P>
<P>
For all of Krantz's fluency in conspicuous consumption -- ``my beat
is not the lady next door'' -- the resident of pricey Bel Air, Calif.,
confesses that she no longer has time to go out and shop on Rodeo
Drive or anywhere else. ``I have managed to acquire clothes, but in
lightning forays,'' said Krantz, 67, a diminutive gabber who was clad
during a recent New York visit in a muted green Chanel suit.
</P>
<P>
``J. Crew and J. Peterman are my favorite catalogs. And then I go
to Chanel. They have a book of the spring and fall collections with
swatches of fabric and designs, and drawings or photographs. I order
from that. When it comes in, I go, I try the clothes on and I say, `I
can wear this on `Larry King,' with a black blouse' ...
</P>
<P>
``I used to shop for pleasure. Now I shop for television. It's a
whole other world. When I couldn't afford it, I was shopping anyway
... Now that I can more than afford it, I don't have the time. It's
not a really tragic story, but I don't have the time.
</P>
<P>
``At midnight, or 1 in the morning, I'll call and have a chat with
the friendly folks at J. Crew. It's amazing what kind of a bill you
can run up that way.''
</P>

Some of the phone operators recognize her name, she said, but ``all
they want to know is the number of my Visa card.''

Judith Regan has earned more newspaper and magazine coverage than
any book editor in history, or so it seems, mainly because she helped
turn manuscripts by Rush Limbaugh, Howard Stern and Kathie Lee Gifford
into best-selling riches. Now, after much speculation about Regan's
plans, an announcement this week revealed that Simon Schuster has
lost the hard-charging editor to Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. and its
subsidiary companies.
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old Regan will become a reporter for a Fox TV news
magazine in development, she will start up Regan Books within
HarperCollins Publishers and she will develop films for Twentieth
Century-Fox. In a prepared statement, Murdoch said ``we expect great
things from her as she branches out beyond the world of publishing.''

One of the more surprising details in this week's ocean of ink
about the late Jacqueline Onassis comes in The New Yorker (May 30),

 The Clarity of D-Day (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
D-Day: landingboats, dramatic action, a known and evil
foe, full power, victory. Nothing has changed more in 50 years than
the way in which we routinely tend to the global stability that was
bought by massive commitment and sacrifice in World War II.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations peacekeeping operations now scattered around the
world are everything D-Day was not: marginal, ambivalent, ragged,
controversial. But how could it be otherwise? And who would again want
total war?
</P>
<P>
We must deal with the world we live in, and we live in a world
where peacekeeping in its various forms is unavoidable and important
to us. We have not done it well enough and as a result we face a
certain crisis of internationalism. Bill Clinton is blamed for
wobbling, Boutros Boutros-Ghali for overreaching. But such criticisms
miss the main point. The real trouble is that in this time of relative
safety and security for the favored nations, peacekeeping can mean an
unwelcome degree of personal risk to the forces taking part and
political risk to their sponsoring governments. Americans have spent
the past few years wrestling with this dilemma.
</P>
<P>
The post-Cold War vista opened with the rosy and mistaken diagnosis
that Soviet-American confrontation alone had kept the United Nations
from ushering in a new world order. In the second, more sober stage we
are seeing that the United Nations is not merely an irregular
contributor to global stability but sometimes itself a contributor to
disorder. The primary contributors to disorder are the governments and
their challengers. But the deeds done by peacekeepers sometimes have
the unintended but perverse effect of enabling the parties to extend
war and avoid peace.
</P>
<P>
To use the United Nations as an instrument of relief, for example,
sounds noble. But it can also encourage combatants to shift some part
of their war budget to others and can spare them the discipline of an
early reckoning. Are we ready to use relief explicitly as a political
lever? The new pattern of ethnic wars makes this disturbing question
increasingly difficult to evade.
</P>
<P>
The international presence in Bosnia is being used by the Serbs in
an effort to freeze their gains and by the Muslims to reverse their
losses. This is understandable: They are at war. But peacekeepers lend
only themselves to the belligerents' maneuvers when they make their
own safety their first concern.
</P>
<P>
In Bosnia, the United Nations now routinely softens NATO's
ultimatums to avert expected Serb retaliation against exposed U.N.
forces. This makes the world body a partner in diluting its own
credibility and effectiveness. It gets worse when such limited
self-defense as peacekeepers do conduct is treated as a loss of
neutrality. But Americans are poorly placed to complain as long as
American forces do not share the risks on the ground.
</P>
<P>
The embarrassment in Rwanda is scarcely less painful. The United
Nations' first response was to pull peacekeepers out, abandoning the
helpless civilians it was ostensibly there to protect. Some U.N.
forces remain, but with both the Hutu army and Tutsi rebels
threatening to fire upon them if they get in the way, they may not be
there for long.
</P>
<P>
It's not ``the U.N.'s'' fault. A membership organization, it must
heed members unwilling to take more than token casualties. But in that
case, the talking part of the United Nations should stop issuing
resolutions, instructions and promises premised on the notion that the
peacekeeping force is a military juggernaut. The now-desultory
discussion of tactics must get serious. Ground forces might be reduced
and air power brought to bear against the violators of U.N. decrees.
Or forces might be increased and unleashed.
</P>
<P>
Many people have already concluded that international peacekeeping
involving the use of force is a passing phase in global politics, a
post-Cold War experiment that did not work out. But it's early to
throw in the towel. I think there is still a logic in proposals for a
standby U.N. combat force that members had endowed with a mission and
with suitable resources. Not that the members-sovereign states, after
all-couldn't later take back their approval. But at least there would
be an effort to deal with the real world of hard choices rather than a
pretend world in which everybody acts as though peace comes for free.
</P>
<P>
In any event, let us not slip too casually and uncritically into
D-Day celebration of a war that, after all, involved a global
cataclysm and caused more than a quarter-million American combat
deaths. It was horrible. We should be glad that our security and
stability cares, though they use up our whole frazzle quotient, are
trivial compared with the challenges that America and its Allies faced
and mastered in World War II.

 PINKERTON COMMENTARY: D.C. Frankensteins Build Health-Care Monster 
 Pinkerton is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By James P. Pinkerton 
 Special to Newsday 
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration's original plan for health-care
alliances may be dead, but Washington pols are still struggling to
assemble bureaucratic body parts into a Frankenstein's monster that
will carry them past the electoral finish line in November.
</P>
<P>
Lightning struck in one political laboratory last week when the
Senate Labor and Human Resources committee voted to piece together a
National Health Board to establish a ``standard benefits package'' for
any health plan that might be forthcoming. This may have been a small
victory for bipartisanship, but it was a big victory for the system of
simultaneous credit-taking and blame-shifting Congress has perfected.
The board will empower both Democrats and Republicans to say what they
want about how compassionate (or thrifty) they are, secure in the
knowledge that a bunch of bureaucrats will take the heat for defects
of the ultimate health-care product.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the board say it will control costs. But that's not
why the Congress created it. The board's real value is as a
diversionary punching bag. Citizens, sick from disease of the body
and/or the wallet, will target faceless apparatchiks, not a real-live
elected official.
</P>
<P>
The major reason that the inflation of health-care costs has been
diminishing in recent years is that private-sector insurers have been
squeezing benefits. Such cost-cutting is easy for business people;
they don't have to win popularity contests. But politicians do, and
that means currying favor with those who can give them votes or money.
Every special interest knows that the health board will be the Potomac
equivalent of one-stop shopping. Lobbyists will descend on it like
vampires in the night; groups that can't win their case in the
daylight of either the free market or public opinion will suck what
they want from the American jugular.
</P>
<P>
In case you haven't noticed, all the incentives in Washington are
to increase spending. Consider just one controversial issue that the
Congress will delegate to the board: coverage for mental health. No
rational lawmaker wants to vote ``against'' the mentally ill, but
nobody wants to be on record voting to pay for such expensive
coverage, either.
</P>
<P>
The George Washington University Medical Center has been running
ads in The Washington Post arguing for ``non-discriminatory
inclusion'' of mental-health treatment in any plan. The ad cites a
study purporting to show that full treatment for depression would save
the nation $35 billion a year in restored productivity. Maybe so. But
bear in mind that the mental-health community has every incentive to
lowball cost estimates, secure in the knowledge that once the program
is in place it will be almost impossible to roll it back, even if the
projections turn out to be grotesquely wrong, as they were three
decades ago with Medicare.
</P>
<P>
Consider other candidates for ``non-discriminatory inclusion'':
post-traumatic stress disorder, attention deficit disorder, repressed
memory of sexual abuse, multiple personalities and ``ghetto stress
syndrome.'' Overnight, special pleaders for these ailments and more
will spring up, demanding their share of the federal pie. And, in the
final irony, members of Congress will use all their influence on the
board to help a favored constituency. That's right: Congress will
lobby its own creation, because the final responsi-bility will still
rest with the board.
</P>
<P>
The point is not to single out mental health for criticism. One
could just as easily predict the income-optimizing advocacy of balding
men, shamans and fallen-arch sufferers. The point is this: If
Washington creates a political football, everyone will toss it around.
The National Health Board won't eliminate politics. It will merely
insulate the president and the Congress from the consequences of
politics.

 David Byrne's Head Is Talking on His Wry, Dreamy New Album 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a half a dozen years in which he's directed films, founded a
record company and dabbled in worldbeat and orchestral music, David
Byrne has finally gotten back to doing what he does best -- being
himself.
</P>
<P>
``David Byrne'' (Luaka Bop/Sire 45558) marks the singer's return to
the wry, affectless writing style he perfected in his early work with
Talking Heads. Like ``Uh-Oh Love Comes to Town'' or ``Don't Worry
About the Government,'' the best of these songs are tuneful,
plain-spoken and full of wonder, depicting his world with dreamlike
clarity and understated wit.
</P>
<P>
Simply put, it's his strongest work in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
It's also -- and this may not be entirely coincidental -- his
simplest work in a long time. Ever since Newsweek declared him
``Rock's Renaissance Man'' in the early '80s, Byrne has done his best
to live up to that title, drawing on everything from dadaist poetry to
Lucumi rites to show just how clever and eclectic he could be.
</P>
<P>
This album, by contrast, has nothing to prove on that level.
Byrne's current band is a quartet (bassist Paul Socolow, drummer Todd
Turkisher and mallet percussionist Mauro Refosco are the other
members), and ``David Byrne'' offers an appropriately trim sound. Gone
are the blaring brass and roiling percussion of his last couple of
touring bands; gone, too, are the worldbeat experiments that fueled
his previous solo efforts, ``Rei Momo'' and ``Uh-Oh.''
</P>
<P>
In their place are the sort of arrangements Byrne used to rely on
when he was still part of Talking Heads. ``Angels,'' for instance,
opens with a rhythm vamp and recitation that recalls the opening verse
of ``Once In a Lifetime,'' while ``Nothing At All,'' with its neatly
harmonized chorus and coolly understated pulse, comes across as a
close cousin to Talking Heads oldies like ``Who Is It?''
</P>
<P>
That's not to say Byrne has begun repeating himself. For one thing,
this new band has far greater range than the Heads did. It would be
difficult, after all, to imagine the old Talking Heads maintaining the
emotional balance of a song like ``Crash,'' in which rage and
tenderness intermingle in the roaring guitar and swirling percussion.
Byrne's new band handles it easily.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the level of imagination in Byrne's songs is well beyond
where it was when ``Talking Heads: 77'' came out.
</P>
<P>
In addition to its deliciously dreamy blend of guitar, marimba and
synths, ``A Self-Made Man'' boasts a hauntingly clever lyric about a
future in which genetic engineering becomes the domain of mobsters.
``And now we got a black market/A black market in designer genes,''
sings Byrne. ``The most beautiful, most intelligent/Criminals you've
ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
Nor has Byrne entirely forgone his interest in global music. ``You
and Eye,'' for instance, includes a nifty mbaqanga guitar break, while
the dark, minor-key melody of ``Sad Song'' floats over a cushion of
Afro-Cuban percussion.
</P>
<P>
But this time around, those elements are mixed in more for spice
than anything else. So although ``My Love Is You'' comes on as a samba
of sorts, what we hear is less an exercise in musical exoticism than a
clever means of making the song seem romantic, even as Byrne skewers
the conventional notion of love song sentiments. (The tuba solo on the
you're-a-jerk, I'm-a-jerk bridge is particularly brilliant.)
</P>
<P>
As a result, ``David Byrne'' allows the singer to have his cake,
and eat it, too. By soft-pedaling his artistic ambition and
downplaying his cultural reach, he's able to make music that's as
enjoyable as it is ingenious.
</P>
<P>
It may be the smartest thing he's ever done.

 LITTWIN COMMENTARY: Too Bad Falwell Missed Out on McCarthy Era 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The man sits in front of a camera. He's wearing a red sweater and a
down-home smile. He talks to us in soft, reassuring tones from a
videotape produced by Jerry Falwell, the evangelist who would save
America from itself, or at least from Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The man in the sweater does not seem like a nut case. At least, not
immediately.
</P>
<P>
His name is Larry Nichols. He's from Arkansas. He is, to put it in
the nicest terms, Clinton's enemy. That's probably a fair description
of someone who basically accuses you of murder.
</P>
<P>
That's right. Anyone can accuse the president of womanizing -- I
mean, who hasn't? -- and Nichols surely can't resist himself. But it
takes a special kind of person to throw murder into the mix.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has lots of enemies. You just have to take a run through
the AM-radio dial to find them and all the anti-Clinton bile they
cough up on the talk shows. Clinton-bashing is as American as Rush
Limbaugh.
</P>
<P>
But Nichols takes the concept to a different level. He was
anti-Clinton before there was an anti-Clinton movement. A former
Arkansas state employee, Nichols filed a lawsuit against Clinton in
1990, making an assortment of charges, including chasing women on
company time.
</P>
<P>
He was around during the 1992 election, feeding reporters who came
to Arkansas all the anti-Clinton material they could swallow.
</P>
<P>
Now, with help from Falwell's Liberty Alliance, he has upped the
ante. Radio isn't good enough. Neither are your right-wing
newsletters. Video is the medium of our time, as any TV evangelist
could tell you.
</P>
<P>
And for 43 bucks, Nichols comes directly to you on a video called
``Clinton's Circle of Power.'' Yes, I know that for 43 bucks you can
buy copies of ``Jurassic Park'' and ``Aladdin'' and have enough left
over for a couple of Happy Meals.
</P>
<P>
But you get your money's worth with this tape. Believe me. You get
up close and personal with a smear campaign. You get to see the
get-Clinton boys at their get-down-and-dirty best. It makes you proud
to be an American. In a lot of other countries, they'd lock these
people up.
</P>
<P>
You see, Nichols doesn't simply catalog the bimbo explosions or
quote Arkansas state troopers or call Clinton a pathological liar. No,
sir. He also flatly states that Hillary Clinton and Vince Foster were
lovers. Then he accuses them of insider trading.
</P>
<P>
Of course, he believes Foster was murdered. You can hear that
anywhere on the right-wing media circuit. Just like you can hear that
Whitewater special prosecutor Robert Fiske, although a Republican, is
a Clinton stooge.
</P>
<P>
But Nichols is just getting warmed up. Right before he implies that
Clinton might have some connection to a drug-smuggling ring, he
strongly suggests Clinton may have been involved in what he calls -- 
get ready -- countless murders.
</P>
<P>
Here's the quote fresh from the tape, which may not be the
``Manchurian Candidate'' but is still your basic paranoid vision of
America: ``People are dead in Arkansas. When I started this, I knew
that I might be one of those unsolved mysteries in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
``There are boys on railroad tracks. There are countless and
countless people who mysteriously died that, as it turned out, had
some connection to Bill Clinton. I believe this is going on today.''
</P>
<P>
This is when you hit the stop button on your remote. This is when
you either laugh or throw something at the screen. This is when you
say to yourself, ``OK, Bill Clinton may not be everything I wanted in
a president, but I'm pretty sure he's not Billy the Kid.''
</P>
<P>
In fact, if you judge Clinton by his enemies, suddenly he looks
like Abe Lincoln. Whenever I get down on the guy, I just jam the video
into the VCR and, within five minutes, I'm ready to re-elect.
</P>
<P>
Ask yourself: Are you ready to believe any of this? Murder? Drug
smuggling? Slush funds? Is this Bill Clinton we're talking about or
Manuel Noriega?
</P>
<P>
What's real and what's propaganda? And just how far will Clinton's
enemies go?
</P>
<P>
Falwell wants to have it both ways. He produces the tape. He
appears at the end of it and implores ``God-fearing'' people to write
their members of Congress and demand full hearings.
</P>
<P>
But when asked on CNN if he believed Clinton was a murderer,
Falwell said, ``We're simply saying these charges are being made, look
at them and determine what is true. I am making no charges
whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
You know, it's too bad Falwell missed out on the McCarthy era. Of
course, McCarthy missed out on VCRs.

 With `Antenna,' Things Looking Up Again for ZZ Top 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZZ Top went back to basics for its new album, ``Antenna.''
</P>
<P>
But the accompanying tour is the most elaborate in the
quarter-century of the ``little band from Texas.''
</P>
<P>
``This time, we've outdone ourselves for sure,'' says Frank Beard,
the band's drummer. ``It's really a cool production. It kind of
follows the `Antenna' theme of the album, and we've got elevators,
moving cranes, sidewalks and cyberlights now. ...''
</P>
<P>
Cyberwhat?
</P>
<P>
``Spots. Instead of follow spots, it's all automated now. Any
little move you make, everybody sees it,'' he explains in his drawl.
``You have a little transmitter in your hat. If you just stand still,
move your head back and forth, you can see the lights do the same
thing.''
</P>
<P>
And if you tossed the hat into the audience, the spotlight would
follow it as well?
</P>
<P>
``Yeah it would,'' says Beard, who, despite his name, is the only
cleanshaven member of the trio, rounded out by Billy Gibbons and Dusty
Hill. ``That would be a good gag. Except you'd lose the transmitter,
which costs about $1,000.''
</P>
<P>
Replacing the spotlight operators, who sit precariously amid the
light rigging on stage, is only natural for the band, which, on its
1983 ``Eliminator'' tour, appeared to kill off a lighting operator at
the show's climax.
</P>
<P>
It makes you wonder whether there ever will be a point ZZ Top won't
be able to top itself.
</P>
<P>
``I don't know,'' Beard says. ``It's rough for us not to do so
much. It's always been a ZZ thing -- or a Texas thing. We sit around
saying, `We could do this; we could do that,' and someone else would
get fired up. And we'd end up going on tour with buffaloes and
steers.''
</P>
<P>
People still talk about the menagerie that went out on the road
with the elaborate 1975 ``Worldwide Texas Tour: Takin' Texas to the
People.'' Besides the hoofed animals, it also involved two
rattlesnakes, tarantulas and buzzards.
</P>
<P>
But everybody was just as happy to see the animals go, Beard says.
``We traded 'em in on dancers,'' he says, mentioning another ZZ Top
trademark. ``They're easier to keep.''
</P>
<P>
With the dancers in the '80s came a slicker ZZ Top style, some
amusing videos and a bigger-than-ever career with the blockbuster
``Eliminator'' and ``Afterburner'' albums -- a time when its music was
shamelessly augmented by synthesizer programs. And, as depicted in the
new book ``Sharp Dressed Men'' by one-time crew member David Blayney
(Hyperion), Hill once pretended to play synthesizer on stage for ``TV
Dinners,'' while the real sound was on tape, fed by the sound crew.
</P>
<P>
Beard says the band has been using sequencers on stage for years,
and it's no big deal. ``You can sit there and push one note and play a
whole song,'' he says. ``What's more valid? If you have a machine that
you can program the whole thing, and punch one button and it will sit
there and go, `dadda, dadda, dadda, dadda,' or if you've got somebody
up there off to the side of the stage with two fingers going `dadda,
dadda, dadda, dadda'? What difference does it make?''
</P>
<P>
There's a lot less of that pulsing synthesizer sound on ``Antenna''
and in the new show. But not because it was planned that way.
</P>
<P>
``When we first started our writing sessions for this record, we
went into our little funky rehearsal studio down in Houston,'' Beard
says.
</P>
<P>
There, using drums, bass and guitar, they were surprised at how
quickly the songs came. ``It was like: `Hey, this is a lot less work
doing it this way than it is messing with that piece of equipment over
there.' So we wrote the whole record that way. We didn't use the
synthesizer as a main instrument on anything,'' Beard says. ``It's
easier to sit down and play and make up songs than to make up songs
and then to program them.''
</P>
<P>
It makes for less trouble on stage, too, where the trio can stretch
out on songs rather than be tied to a disembodied synthesizer track.
</P>
<P>
Still, the group will throw in some of those '80s synthesizer
favorites, Beard says.
</P>
<P>
``It's gotten to the point where we're going to make somebody mad
every night anyway. We're going to leave off somebody's favorite. Last
tour, we didn't do `Cheap Sunglasses,' and people were on us the whole
tour. So this tour we're doing `Cheap Sunglasses,' but there's
something else that got left out. That comes from being around
forever.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Of course, many bands would envy such fad-dodging longevity, which
has been extended by a five-album deal with RCA at a figure that's
been reported to be from $30 million to $45 million.
</P>
<P>
The band did it in part by capitalizing on the video form. The
band's latest has it appearing as vampires in a ``Thriller''-style
clip for ``Breakaway'' that's also its most expensive.
</P>
<P>
Once more, it will likely include visual clues as obvious to fans
as the sound of Gibbon's guitar: a car, a set of keys, a group of
models, a hand signal.
</P>
<P>
``For some reason,'' Beard says, ``when we started making videos,
all we did was try to show what we were into. We already had a red
car. So we thought, `Let's put the red car in the movies.' It all just
seemed to work out together for us where it became a rock 'n' roll
icon. It wasn't like we're super smart and we thought: `Let's build a
car, and hire some girls.' We had the car, and there were some girls
hanging around, and we thought: `Shoot, they're prettier' than we
were, let's feature them, and we'll just kind of watch.''
</P>
<P>
Most of all, they tried to keep things light.
</P>
<P>
``ZZ's always been a fun band, more or less,'' Beard says. ``I
don't like people who take themselves too serious and get up there and
shake their hair and that kind of thing. I think if you watch a ZZ Top
video, you're going to smile somewhere in it. That's all we care
about.''

 World War II Keepsakes (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thomas J. McCullough of Albuquerque is as excited as
any World War II veteran about the series of stamps that the Postal
Service started issuing in 1991 to mark the 50th anniversary of the
war. But he's got one big problem: Not many people seem to be using
the stamps for postage.
</P>
<P>
McCullough, a retired sergeant first-class, uses them on all his
mail and adds an urgent message about the stamps to all his envelopes.
``No one heralds their presence -- You must ask!'' reads McCullough's
plea. ``Pearl Harbor was real. WWII did happen, history is in these
stamps. Buy, save, use -- make them your `Stamp of Approval.' ''.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Postal Service is pleased with profits from sales
of the stamps. Unlike McCullough, most people who have purchased the
World War II commemoratives have been putting them in scrapbooks
rather than on envelopes. ``Hardly any veteran knows that (the stamps)
exist, complained McCullough, 78. Postal officials sell out so quickly
``you can't get 'em,'' he said. Stamp art director Howard Paine, who
has overseen the Postal Service's five-year effort to commemorate the
war, admits to being troubled by the paucity of stamps being used for
postage. To Paine and many other stamp artists there is no higher
accolade than seeing their stamp designs on an envelope. That is
proof, the artists say, that the public accepts their work and
appreciates the subject celebrated on a stamp.
</P>
<P>
But few people at Postal Service Headquarters will concede to
worrying about whether stamps are used as postage. Since a stamp saved
is 29 cents profit for the cash-strapped agency, the World War II
stamps have been a big hit there.
</P>
<P>
The World War II stamps are not as big as the Elvis Presley stamp,
which hit $35 million in profit, but Azeezaly S. Jaffer, the Postal
Service's top stamp official, calls them an unqualified success.
</P>
<P>
According to Jaffer, the first three sets of World War II stamps
have yielded between $7.5 million and $10 million profit each. That's
enough to prompt Jaffer and others to try to devise plans for a
sequel.
</P>
<P>
``I think the stamps have been really exciting. ... There has been
a tremendous outpouring of interest, especially from veterans
groups,'' Jaffer said. ``I don't see a lot of World War II stamps on
mail, which tells me that people are buying these stamps and keeping
them.''
</P>
<P>
On June 6, the Postal Service will release 10 more stamps to
commemorate the war. As American officials gather in France to mark
the 50th anniversary of the D-Day landing at Normandy, Postmaster
General Marvin T. Runyon is scheduled to join President Clinton and
other U.S. officials aboard the aircraft carrier USS George Washington
off the Normandy coast and dedicate the fourth set of World War II
stamps. Separate ceremonies will be held in Washington and 13 other
cities that day to celebrate the new stamps.
</P>
<P>
The official first-day cancellations will come from the USS
Normandy, a guided missile cruiser, which is to be among the U.S.
ships off France June 6. It will be only the third time that a U.S.
stamp will have been dedicated outside the country, according to the
Postal Service. The first two were at stamp shows in 1978 and 1988 in
Canada.
</P>
<P>
The Normandy cancellation will be available at the National Postal
Museum in Washington, where a ceremony with Secretary of Defense
William J. Perry will commemorate the release. The stamps also will go
on sale June 6 at Fort Dix, N.J.; Salt Lake City; New York City;
Clarksville, Tenn.; Bangor, Maine; Fort Campbell, Ky.; Charleston,
S.C.; Virginia Beach and Richmond, Va.; and three Texas locations:
Fort Sam Houston, Lubbock and San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
Like the other stamps in the series, this year's set is being sold
in special sheets that feature a color map of the world highlighting
the events that occurred 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Titled ``1944: Road to Victory,'' this year's stamps salute the
Normandy invasion, retaking of New Guinea, bombing raids, airborne
unit assaults, submarine warfare in the Pacific, the retaking of Rome,
the attack on Saipan, the Red Ball Express speeding supplies to the
front, the Battle of Leyte Gulf, Bastogne and the Battle of the Bulge.
</P>
<P>
To encourage more people to save the stamps, Jaffer is planning to
introduce a special ``Stamp Folio,'' a souvenir booklet that will hold
all five sheets planned for the series. Booklets with the first four
sheets will be sold by the Postal Service for $14.95.
</P>
<P>
The stamps were designed by Bill Bond of Arlington, Va., who
painted all 50 stamps in the series. The Bureau of Engraving and
Printing used offset and intaglio presses to create the latest stamps.

 1995 Volkswagen Cabrio Gets Friendly Aprroval 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chevrolet Corvette Club was upset. They misunderstood. They
just didn't get what I wrote recently about the way many people react
to folks driving Corvette convertibles and coupes.
</P>
<P>
I wrote that there appears to be an undercurrent of public
hostility toward Corvette drivers. This was from personal experience
and empirical observation. I get into a Corvette and cops follow me,
folks cut me off, women avert their eyes. God forbid that I cut
someone off while driving a Corvette. I get the Ignoble Salute like
nobody's business.
</P>
<P>
Ain't nothin' wrong with the car and there probably isn't much
wrong with Corvette drivers. It's a public perception thing.
Corvettes, generally speaking, are seen as macho, aggressive,
unfriendly. People respond accordingly.
</P>
<P>
But how different it is to be behind the wheel of a 1995 Volkswagen
Cabrio. I drove one for a week -- and made lots of friends. People
waved. Women winked. Cops passed me by with nary a notice.
</P>
<P>
I even gave the Cabrio the Ultimate Motorized Public Acceptance
Test. I inadvertently cut someone off in traffic in the District of
Columbia and braced myself for some shouted expletive. But all I got
was: ``Hey, man, you tryin' to mess up that nice car?''
</P>
<P>
I apologized. The dude waved. Nice, friendly reaction. Nice,
friendly car.
</P>
<P>
Background: Cars are about more than performance, as measured in
0-to-60 times, cornering ability, horsepower, torque and that type of
stuff. Cars are also about attitude, which is something that VW's
engineers and designers understand.
</P>
<P>
From the very first Beetle ragtop in 1955 to the current Cabrio
model, VW's people have given us simple, embraceable convertibles,
cars that seem to run on optimism as much as fuel. It's a joy to be in
these things on a great day, tootling along with the top down.
</P>
<P>
Of course, the guts are there in the new front-wheel-drive Cabrio -- 
albeit not in strong enough measure to please wannabe race car
drivers. The car runs with a two-liter, in-line four-cylinder engine,
rated 115 horsepower at 5,400 rpm. Maximum torque is 122 foot-pounds
at 3,200 rpm.
</P>
<P>
Standard brakes include power front-discs/rear drums with anti-lock
backup. A roll bar is standard (I prefer to have it there). Dual air
bags are standard, but VW jettisoned the glove box to get the
passenger bag in.
</P>
<P>
The standard transmission is five-speed manual; a four-speed
automatic is optional. The six-layer, vinyl-coated, convertible cloth
top is manual, but it works faster and better than many power models
at a substantially lower cost.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the new Cabrio has an overall stiffer body than its
predecessors and more interior space than a substantially pricier BMW
325i convertible.
</P>
<P>
Complaints: No glove box. Practically nonexistent trunk at 7.8
cubic feet. Yo, somebody at VW forget something?
</P>
<P>
Praise: Ease of use. Overall quality of design and build. Ample
rear seat room for two ``normal size'' adults. Great fun at an almost
reasonable price.
</P>
<P>
Head-turning quotient: Body beautiful by Karmann Coachworks, with
rounded exterior, teardrop headlamps and high rear end. Way more
cheers than jeers.
</P>
<P>
Ride, acceleration and handling: Firm, but comfortable ride. Crisp
handling and good acceleration for normal drivers. Excellent braking.
</P>
<P>
Mileage: About 26 miles per gallon (14.5-gallon tank, estimated
367-mile range on usable volume of required regular unleaded),
five-speed manual model, running mostly highway and driver only.
</P>
<P>
Sound system: AM/FM stereo radio and cassette with optional compact
disc player, Volkswagen Premium sound system. The first VW sound
system I've actually enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
Price: Base price is $19,975. Dealer's invoice on base model is
$18,161. Price as tested is $21,710, including $1,345 in options and a
$390 destination charge.
</P>
<P>
Purse-strings note: Compare with any subcompact convertible. For
that matter, compare with some luxury convertibles -- including those
from Audi, BMW and, ahm, Chevrolet.

 D-Day Invasion Woven Into Fabric of U.S. Mythology 
 (Colleville-sur-Mer, France)
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
COLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Their graves run in parallel ranks on
the bluff above the bloody shingle called Omaha Beach, where so many
of them fell. Row upon row of headstones fill the American cemetery
here, more than 9,000 all told, each bone-white, each precisely 39
inches tall, each emblematic of a young life forfeited for a greater
good.
</P>
<P>
The grass has been clipped, the hedges trimmed, the marble
scrubbed. And now the fallen wait amid the tranquility of this
hallowed ground for the return of their comrades. Fifty years after
the Normandy landing, they await a last reunion of the quick and the
dead.
</P>
<P>
Normandy: the legend long ago transcended the event itself, joining
those other three-syllable battles -- Trafalgar, Gettysburg, Stalingrad
 -- whose names evoke valor, sacrifice and the steel-on-steel clash of
irreconcilable adversaries.
</P>
<P>
The invasion on June 6, 1944, is now woven into the warp and woof
of our national mythology. It opened the majestic final act of what
was known in an earlier age, without embarrassment or irony, as the
Great Crusade. It also marked, as historian H.P. Willmott wrote, ``the
emergence of the United States as the major power in Western Europe''
and ``the end of the period of European supremacy in the world that
had existed for four centuries.''
</P>
<P>
Joseph Stalin, rarely given to effusive praise for his Western
allies, declared that ``the history of warfare knows no other like
undertaking from the point of view of its scale, its conception and
its masterly execution.'' Military historian John Keegan, carefully
calibrating the losses endured by the Third Reich in Russia and North
Africa, concluded that Normandy ``ranked as the greatest military
disaster Hitler had yet suffered in the field.'' It was epic, heroic
and decisive.
</P>
<P>
Normandy was all of these things, and less. Significant as it was,
the invasion came very late in the war, forcing the Soviet Union to
bear the brunt of the fight in Europe for three years and giving
Moscow squatter's rights to the eastern empire it would soon occupy.
The Normandy campaign itself was marred by sins of omission and
commission: intelligence shortcomings, questionable generalship,
internecine bickering and friendly-fire casualties on a scale unseen
before or since.
</P>
<P>
Notwithstanding their ultimate success, the invaders failed to
capture any of their initial objectives on D-Day; indeed, the critical
crossroads city of Caen would not fall for more than a month. For
seven weeks, the opposing armies slugged it out toe-to-toe in fighting
more reminiscent of static World War I combat -- with Norman hedgerows
substituting for Verdun trenches -- than the mobile warfare commonly
associated with World War II.
</P>
<P>
Foreshadowing the infamous epitaph from Vietnam -- ``we had to
destroy the village in order to save it'' -- the liberators inflicted
massive damage throughout Normandy; by summer's end, about 15,000
French civilians would be killed and 200,000 buildings destroyed.
German tenacity and martial prowess -- though crippled by an oafish
Nazi high command -- were often underestimated by the Allies, who
ultimately prevailed through weight of numbers and overwhelming
firepower. As Max Hastings, whose ``Overlord'' is among the definitive
accounts of the battle, wrote a decade ago, ``Whenever British or
American troops met the Germans in anything like equal strength, the
Germans prevailed.''
</P>
<P>
Let none of it detract from the glory of those who fought and bled
in good faith and good cause. Fifty years ago this week, men who had
never read a line of Shakespeare in their lives found themselves
quoting ``Henry V'' to one another with bardic passion:
</P>
<P>
He that outlives this day, and comes home safe
</P>
<P>
Will stand a-tiptoe when this day is named.
</P>
<P>
They return this week -- for most, it will be a final return -- to
stand once more a-tiptoe.
</P>
<P>
-O- 
</P>
<P>
A generation before Normandy, Sir Edward Grey had likened the
United States to ``a gigantic boiler: once the fire is lighted under
it there is no limit to the power it can generate.'' By 1944, the
boiler had been stoked again. Eleven million Americans were in
military uniforms, including 2 million assigned to 90 combat
divisions. American industry was turning out war materiel at a
stupendous pace.
</P>
<P>
Much of this power was concentrated on the task of liberating
Europe. But how best to do it? British leaders favored defeating
Germany through a series of blows on the Third Reich's periphery;
Washington believed Allied clout should be concentrated in one
staggering punch.
</P>
<P>
The American strategy prevailed. A plan for the invasion of Europe,
code-named Overlord, was reviewed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt,
Prime Minister Winston Churchill and their top generals at a
conference in Quebec in August 1943 and again during meetings in Cairo
and Tehran that winter.
</P>
<P>
The man chosen to lead the crusade had already commanded three
successful amphibious landings. As a relatively junior officer in
March 1942, Dwight D. Eisenhower had also drafted an early version of
the attack plan, which called for an invasion of the continent in
April 1943 by 30 U.S. and 18 British divisions -- 1.5 million men -- who
would land between Le Havre and Boulogne and drive toward Antwerp,
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Eisenhower, historian Eric Larrabee wrote, ``came to Overlord as
though born for it.'' Homespun and self-effacing, Eisenhower also
possessed equilibrium, a deft political touch -- later described as
``hidden-hand leadership'' -- and charisma. ``He had only to smile at
you,'' British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery once admitted, ``and
there was nothing you would not do for him.''
</P>
<P>
As supreme allied commander, Eisenhower was granted extraordinary
autonomy when he established his headquarters in January 1944 in Bushy
Park, outside London. Yet it often took more than smiles to exert his
will. The most serious confrontation involved the deployment of Allied
air power. British and U.S. air chiefs favored a relentless bombing
campaign against strategic targets in Germany; Eisenhower demanded
that a substantial portion of the planes be diverted to strike rail,
road and other targets in northern France.
</P>
<P>
Only by threatening to resign did the supreme commander gain
Roosevelt's support and win the day. Eisenhower's ``transportation
plan,'' as it was called, ultimately prevented rapid German
reinforcement of the landing areas and ``was perhaps his greatest
single contribution to the success of Overlord,'' according to
Eisenhower's biographer, Stephen Ambrose.
</P>
<P>
The Overlord concept had been substantially revised since
Eisenhower's first rough cut in early 1942. Under prodding from
Montgomery, who would command the landing forces, the first wave of
the Allied invasion force was increased from three divisions to five,
while the attack zone was broadened from a 25-mile beachhead to 50
miles. The date, which had already slipped to the spring of 1944 to
allow more training and the buildup of forces in England, was pushed
back another month, to early June, because another 1,000 landing craft
were needed to ferry the extra troops.
</P>
<P>
The critical choice of a landing site, on what the Allied high
command called ``the far shore,'' came somewhat through default.
Allied intelligence had amassed an immense amount of data on winds,
tides and German defenses along the 3,500 miles of coastline from
Norway to Spain; British citizens, responding to an official request
broadcast by the BBC, had donated 10 million postcards and holiday
snapshots, which permitted an Oxford University team to draw up
detailed topographical maps.
</P>
<P>
The most obvious location was the Pas de Calais, which offered the
nearest point across the English Channel -- obvious too to the Germans,
who placed their stoutest defenses around Calais. Normandy was chosen
because its beaches were more sheltered, it had better exit routes
leading inland and the defenses there were less robust.
</P>
<P>
Even so, the assault faced formidable odds. Commanding the
defenders in German Army Group B was Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, the
Desert Fox of North African fame and perhaps the Wehrmacht's most
inventive general. Arriving in France in December 1943, Rommel had
found Hitler's supposedly impregnable Atlantic Wall to be poorly
fortified, undermanned and porous. The average age of German defenders
 -- many of whom were actually Russian and Eastern European prisoners
pressed into service -- was 37. (The average age of American troops on
D-Day was 22.)
</P>
<P>
With frenzied energy, Rommel began thickening the defenses. He
ordered the sowing of 2 million mines a month and the construction of
a half-million obstacles -- steel stakes, barbed-wire thickets,
automatic flame throwers and booby traps -- along the beaches and in
potential landing zones inland. German strength in France increased
from 46 divisions to 55.
</P>
<P>
Much of this was known to the Allies, who had the invaluable and
top-secret advantage of being able to decrypt coded German radio
traffic. These ``Ultra'' intercepts showed Anglo-American planners the
strength and location of most enemy forces.
</P>
<P>
While Allied assault forces rehearsed on replicas of the invasion
beaches built at Slapton Sands in southwest England -- notwithstanding
shoddy security, which permitted German torpedo boats to attack a
convoy in April 1944, killing 749 troops -- Allied counterintelligence
also sought to convince the Germans that the attack would come
somewhere other than Normandy.
</P>
<P>
In air and naval power, the Germans were hopelessly outgunned. With
12,000 aircraft, the Allied air forces available over Normandy
outnumbered the Luftwaffe better than 20 to 1. On D-Day, Allied pilots
would fly 14,674 sorties compared with only 319 for the Germans.
</P>
<P>
The relentless bombardment of railway yards with 50,000 tons of
high explosives not only disrupted German military movements but also
killed innumerable French civilians, including 3,000 in a 48-hour
period. A week before the invasion, Churchill warned Eisenhower's
deputy, ``You are piling up an awful lot of hatred.''
</P>
<P>
Also harassing the Germans was the French Resistance. Responding to
two prearranged radio messages -- ``It is hot in Suez'' and ``The dice
are on the table'' -- the Resistance cut rail lines in nearly 1,000
places and sabotaged hundreds of telephone wires.
</P>
<P>
Yet Overlord seemed so audacious, so pregnant with catastrophe that
the faint-hearted easily took counsel of their fears. The plan's
complexity could be felt in the heft of an early operations order for
the U.S. 1st Army, which contained more words than ``Gone With the
Wind.''
</P>
<P>
Even Eisenhower gave way to defeatism, scribbling a note in
anticipation of failure. ``I have withdrawn the troops,'' he wrote in
part. ``If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt, it is mine
alone.''
</P>
<P>
-O- 
</P>
<P>
No apology was necessary. After postponing the invasion a day
because of heavy rain and high winds, Eisenhower gambled on a
predicted break in the bad weather. ``I don't see how we can possibly
do anything else,'' he told his lieutenants. ``I am quite positive we
must give the order.''
</P>
<P>
The order was given. As the late-summer twilight yielded to
darkness, 24,000 men from three airborne divisions -- the British 6th
and U.S. 82nd and 101st -- reported to 22 airfields in England and
boarded 1,200 transport planes and gliders. Despite predictions from
the Allied air chief that the divisions would suffer up to 70 percent
casualties, Eisenhower and Montgomery believed the units were
necessary to seal the flanks of the invasion zone from German
counterattack.
</P>
<P>
Much of the airborne assault was a courageous fiasco. Only two of
the six U.S. parachute regiments landed where and when they were
supposed to. Some soldiers drifted to earth 35 miles from their drop
zones, while others were machine-gunned to death during the eternal 43
seconds it took to touch down from 700 feet. Eighteen glider pilots
from the 82nd Airborne were killed in the space of a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
Yet the airborne forces won several tactical victories as well as
strategic surprise. British glider troops brilliantly seized key
bridges east of Caen; far to the west, the Americans were first routed
from the important crossroads at Sainte-Mere-Eglise but later
succeeded in capturing the town. ``The very extent of its scatter,''
wrote Keegan, ``had multiplied the effect of confusion in the German
high command, preventing it from offering any organized riposte.''
</P>
<P>
In the words of historian David Howarth, ``the Americans knew what
was happening, but few of them knew where they were; the Germans knew
where they were, but none of them knew what was happening.''
</P>
<P>
As dawn broke, an armada of more than 3,000 Allied ships appeared
through the Channel mist, steaming through 10 lanes cleared by
minesweepers. Two hundred of the vessels opened up with the most
intense bombardment in naval history, their shells chewing huge divots
still visible along the coast today.
</P>
<P>
The assault had been timed for low tide to expose as many of
Rommel's underwater obstacles as possible. At 6:31 a.m., only one
minute behind schedule, the first landing craft dropped its ramp and
soldiers from the 4th Infantry Division began wading 100 yards to Utah
Beach on the far western end of the invasion sector.
</P>
<P>
Confusion and a strong current had conspired to push the first wave
more than a mile from the intended landing zone. Theirs was a happy
error; the accidental beach was lightly defended. Brig. Gen. Theodore
Roosevelt, 57-year-old son of the former president and the only
general to go ashore in the first wave, announced, ``We're going to
start the war from here.''
</P>
<P>
But 10 miles to the east, at Omaha Beach, the 1st and 29th Infantry
Divisions found only death and misery. Undetected by Allied
intelligence until the last minute, the Germans had more than doubled
the forces on the bluffs fronting the beach.
</P>
<P>
The defenders had barely been scratched by Allied aircraft, which,
unable to see through the heavy clouds, dropped most of their bombs
far inland. In another intelligence failure, Army Rangers struggled up
the 100-foot cliffs of Pointe du Hoc between Utah and Omaha -- clawing
at the rock with grappling hooks, knives and fingers -- only to
discover that the big guns they were supposed to destroy had been
moved. All but 90 of the original 225 Rangers were killed or wounded.
</P>
<P>
Below on Omaha, terrified, seasick American soldiers fell by the
score as machine-gun bullets whipped the water white, then red. All 26
artillery guns in the first wave sank; only two of 24 amphibious tanks
made it ashore. Successive waves plunged grimly ahead, ignoring the
shrieks of drowning comrades. Bodies lay in windrows along the
shoreline. Dead men drifted on the making tide.
</P>
<P>
Aboard the USS Aurora several miles offshore, Lt. Gen. Omar
Bradley, commander of the U.S. 1st Army, concluded at 9 a.m. that
``our troops had suffered an irreversible catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
A catastrophe yes, but not irreversible. Farther east, on beaches
Gold, Juno and Sword, British and Canadian troops punched ashore on a
20-mile front against lighter defenses and over easier terrain. The
Americans at Utah pressed toward Sainte-Mere-Eglise. By nightfall, the
British at Gold had penetrated six miles inland and linked up with the
Canadians from Juno within sight of Caen.
</P>
<P>
By the end of D-Day, nearly 175,000 troops were ashore at a cost of
more than 10,000 casualties, of whom about 2,500 were killed. (Exact
figures were never determined for either the number of Allied soldiers
landed in France by sea and air, or for casualties. Estimates of
German deaths for the day range from 4,000 to 8,000.) The Allies had
their toehold on France.
</P>
<P>
``Overlord,'' Stalin cabled Churchill, ``is a source of joy to us
all.''
</P>
<P>
-O- 
</P>
<P>
Now came the hard part.
</P>
<P>
Hitler had immeasurably aided the Allied cause by fragmenting his
command structure and personally retaining control over more than half
of the German tank forces in Normandy. In history's most celebrated
nap, the fuehrer went to bed in his Bavarian retreat at 4 a.m. on June
6 and slumbered undisturbed by his inner coterie of sycophants despite
frantic pleas for armored reinforcements from his generals on the
western front.
</P>
<P>
Rommel, who had taken leave in Germany, immediately rushed back to
France. But by the time he was in position to command his forces and
Hitler had woken to the gravity of his predicament, it was too late to
level the kind of devastating counterpunch against the beachhead that
Rommel had long believed imperative. By now, the best the defenders
could hope for was to keep the invaders bottled up indefinitely, a
task the Germans performed expertly for nearly three months.
</P>
<P>
As the Germans had missed an opportunity, so had the Allies. ``A
great amount of work, thought and intelligence-gathering had gone into
the assault phase -- getting a toehold on the beach,'' Bradley later
wrote. ``But not nearly enough planning and intelligence-gathering had
been devoted to the immediate problems of exploitation of the
beachhead.''
</P>
<P>
Although Montgomery insisted for years that the campaign proceeded
exactly according to his master plan, many historians hold him
responsible for the failure to seize Caen immediately and plow through
the disorganized defenders. Instead, the summer was spent launching a
series of bloody and costly offensives that accomplished little.
Operation Goodwood, for example, gained the British seven miles of
French soil at the expense of 6,000 casualties and 400 tanks.
</P>
<P>
Other catastrophes intruded. A tremendous storm in mid-June
demolished one of the Allies' two floating harbors, temporarily
cutting resupply to a trickle. American fighter pilots mistakenly
strafed Canadian prisoners of war being marched toward Rennes, killing
15; errant American carpet bombing around Saint-Lo inflicted 814
American casualties and killed Lt. Gen. Lesley J. McNair.
</P>
<P>
Such setbacks notwithstanding, the campaign -- and the war -- had
effectively been won once the beachhead took root. Allied air
superiority, Rommel complained, left German forces ``completely
paralyzed'' during the day; the 2nd Panzer Division took 17 days to
move from Toulouse to Normandy, normally a three-day trip. In a letter
to his son, the field marshal bemoaned the loss of more men in a
single day of Normandy fighting than in the entire summer of 1942 in
the North African campaign.
</P>
<P>
Cherbourg fell on June 27. By July 2, the Allies had 1 million
soldiers and 172,000 vehicles on ``the far shore.'' The Russians
tightened the noose around the Third Reich by launching Operation
Bagration on the eastern front with 1.7 million Soviet troops and
2,700 tanks. On July 25, the Americans finally succeeded in breaking
out of Normandy with Operation Cobra, spearheaded by the intrepid,
pistol-packing Lt. Gen. George S. Patton Jr.
</P>
<P>
Allied forces reached the Loire river on Aug. 13; less than two
weeks later, Paris was liberated. Asked for advice by Hitler's high
command, Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, commander of German forces
in the west, famously replied, ``Make peace, you idiots! What else can
you do?''
</P>
<P>
-O- 
</P>
<P>
Not for many months would there be peace, except for the dead.
Total casualties in the 80-day Normandy campaign are put at 637,000,
including prisoners of war, according to historian Carlo D'Este. The
losses included 20,838 Americans killed and 94,881 wounded. The
estimated German tally was 200,000 killed and wounded and another
200,000 captured. So many rotting bodies littered the Norman landscape
that pilots 1,000 feet up covered their noses.
</P>
<P>
By D'Este's calculations, five German tank divisions and 20
infantry divisions had been destroyed; six other tank divisions and 12
infantry divisions were severely battered. Three German corps
commanders and 20 division commanders had been killed, wounded or
captured. ``It was,'' Rommel grimly observed, ``one terrible
bloodletting.''
</P>
<P>
For the Allied victors, Normandy also sanctified the transatlantic
relationship, double-knotting the bonds of an alliance that would
endure nearly five decades of Cold War and beyond. The landings
brought to the continent the first wave in an inexorable invasion of
American culture, political influence and military leadership. And
Normandy marked the beginning, agonizing though it was, of an enduring
epoch of peace and stability in a Western Europe that included a
peaceful, stable Germany.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands who came to Normandy a half-century ago never
left. There are 27 national cemeteries here containing the mortal
remains of American, British, Canadian, Polish and German veterans. In
the middle of the Colleville cemetery, where four of every 10 U.S.
soldiers who fell in Normandy are buried, a little chapel contains
this inscription on the wall:
</P>
<P>
Think not only upon their passing.
</P>
<P>
Remember the glory of their spirit.
</P>
<P>
``There's a responsibility to pass the flame to successive
generations,'' said Joseph P. Rivers, superintendent of the cemetery
for the past 11 years. ``We can't let it fade away. A nation can't
forget its history.''

 Clinton's China Decision Sad But Correct 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Clinton acted appropriately Thursday in decoupling human
rights from trade policy in renewing most-favored-nation trading
status for China. ``We have reached the end of the usefulness of that
policy,'' he said, and we must sadly agree. It was a difficult
political decision, but one thoughtfully made in recognition of the
need to build a productive, long-term, strategic relationship with
China. A China engaged and open is far more desirable than a communist
giant in isolation.
</P>
<P>
That is not to suggest that China has made vast improvements in
human rights. It has not. Nor should the United States abandon the
issue. The president was unequivocally clear on two points: that the
United States will continue to champion human rights and that abuses
continue in China. But the attempt to leverage trade for improvements
in human rights has fallen short. The question now is what is the best
way to pursue human rights in China? The issue is real, but it should
not be the defining element in political, economic and security
discussions with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Clinton now believes that advances in human rights are far more
likely under improved relations and when they are not beneath the
cloud of the annual MFN review. MFN is accorded the vast majority of
U.S. trading partners without annual reviews. The status allows them
to sell goods in the United States at the lowest possible tariffs.
</P>
<P>
China's MFN status was not subject to annual wrangling until after
June, 1989, when Chinese tanks rolled into Tian An Men Square in a
bloody confrontation with pro-democracy demonstrators. Congress wanted
China's MFN renewal linked to human rights, but it was unable to
prevail over President Bush's preference for unfettered MFN. During
the 1992 presidential campaign Bill Clinton accused Bush of ``coddling
dictators'' in China.
</P>
<P>
Last year President Clinton renewed MFN for China with an executive
order that required China to meet seven conditions, related to human
rights, prison labor and emigration issues. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher certified that China had made improvements in two, but not
the other five. That is probably because changing dynamics within
China over the last year have slowed improvements. Tensions between
the central government and the provinces have widened with
modernization; further stress is resulting because, in light of the
ages of senior officials, changes in leadership are expected soon.
</P>
<P>
With China in flux, Congress should support President Clinton's
balanced decision on MFN, thereby presenting a united U.S. front to
Beijing.

 `If You Like Bill Clinton ...' 
 The following editorial appeared in Friday's Baltimore Sun: 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Republicans, this off-year is getting very interesting. The
party that lost the presidential election usually makes some gains two
years later. So Republicans were expecting to pick up seats in the
House of Representative just on the basis of the historical form
sheet. But two recent special elections have the party's political
leaders positively licking their chops.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Oklahoma voters filled a congressional vacancy
with a Republican state legislator, Frank D. Lucas, who was running
against a Democrat, Dan Webber Jr., a former aide to a U.S. senator.
This district has not had a Republican representative in 20 years.
Then last Tuesday in Kentucky, Republican Ron Lewis, an evangelical
preacher and businessman, defeated former state Sen. Joseph W.
Prather, a Democrat, to fill a vacancy in a district that has been
safely Democratic for over a century.
</P>
<P>
In Oklahoma, the winner stressed his conservatism and his
opponent's ties to Washington. In Kentucky, the winner stressed his
conservatism and linked his opponent to the national Democratic Party.
His best commercial went, ``If you like President Clinton, you'll love
Joe Prather.''
</P>
<P>
These straws in the winds are deeply disturbing to Democratic
incumbents, especially those in the even more conservative, more
anti-Clinton districts south of the Border States. Some Democratic
leaders in the 11 states of the old Confederacy are so pessimistic
about 1994 that they agree with Republican leaders who say the South
might, for the first time, elect as many Republican representatives as
Democrats. There are presently 77 Democrats and 48 Republicans. A gain
of 15 seats would do the trick. A recent journalistic survey of just
the eight Southeastern states concluded that Democrats could lose 14
districts.
</P>
<P>
Even with no Republican gains in the Southwest and the rest of the
nation (which is unlikely), a shift of just 14 seats in the House
would probably give effective control of legislation to a conservative
bloc in the House of Representatives uniting behind the likes of Newt
Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
But can Republicans also make substantial gains in the Senate?
Probably. Democrats have 21 seats up this year (and one the next),
compared to only 13 for the Republicans. The unexpected retirements of
George Mitchell and David Boren, two Democratic shoo-ins for
re-election, give Republicans a good chance in Maine and Oklahoma. And
Democratic Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama is mulling over changing his
party registration.
</P>
<P>
If most of the above Republican wish list happens, Clinton's
legislative agenda will almost surely be dead for 1995-1996, and his
own re-election chances threatened. For health care and other
priorities, it may well be now or never.

 DON'T GET ME STARTED: Flintstones Have No Friend Here 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It started a few nights ago, a horrible dream that left me shaken
and sweat-soaked and obsessing about ... the Flintstones.
</P>
<P>
They were all there in the dream: Fred and Wilma, Betty and Barney
Rubble and all their annoying kids and grinning domesticated
dinosaurs, chasing me with flaming torches and yelling
``Yabba-dabba-doo!'' as we traversed some prehistoric suburban hell.
</P>
<P>
And everywhere overhead there were huge, billowing clouds of smoke
from a thousand pot-bellied cavemen grilling big, greasy
bronto-burgers.
</P>
<P>
``Why am I having this dream?!'' I asked my wife after one
particularly bad episode.
</P>
<P>
She said nothing. In fact, when I looked over, she was lying there
with her eyes closed.
</P>
<P>
``Oh, my God, she's dead!'' I screamed, leaping out of bed and
sobbing hysterically.
</P>
<P>
Then I realized it was 3 in the morning and she was probably just
sleeping, which made me feel a lot better, although frankly the dream
was still bothering me.
</P>
<P>
The point (yes, yes, there is a point to all this) is that there is
no escaping the Flintstones anymore, not even when you sleep.
</P>
<P>
After weeks of relentless hype, ``The Flintstones'' movie has
finally opened. And if the trailers for this baby are any indication,
it looks goofy enough to make ``The Addams Family'' look like
``Citizen Kane.''
</P>
<P>
Naturally, the inevitable commercialization has also begun, and
we're being asked to buy Flintstones backpacks, Flintstones lunch
pails, Flintstones posters and all sorts of Flintstones toys.
</P>
<P>
The whole business is getting ugly. I was at McDonald's the other
day, and I asked the 16-year-old Metallica disciple behind the counter
for a diet soda.
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, his eyes shone with the eerie glow of the true company
fanatic, and he said: ``You want a Bedrock mug?''
</P>
<P>
``I ... just want a Diet Coke,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
Which apparently was the wrong thing to say, because now he was
pounding his fist on the counter and almost shouting: ``But we have
Bedrock mugs!''
</P>
<P>
Bedrock mugs, Flintstones Happy Meals ... our society keeps
unraveling at an astonishing pace.
</P>
<P>
But this is what happens when a potential blockbuster movie is
accompanied by a $100 million marketing campaign.
</P>
<P>
People get carried away. In the New York Times , the movie's
director, Brian Levant, was quoted as saying of the Flintstones:
``They are spokesmen, celebrated figures in our culture. You don't
make a Pez dispenser out of just anyone.''
</P>
<P>
Well, no, but ... does anyone else have a problem with the idea of
Fred and Barney as spokesmen?
</P>
<P>
Me, when I think of a spokesman, I think of, oh, Henry Kissinger.
Or maybe James Earl Jones.
</P>
<P>
I don't think of ... Barney Rubble.
</P>
<P>
Besides, I'm not sure how much clout Barney brings to the world of
product endorsement.
</P>
<P>
If I come out with a new line of, say, radial tires, I don't think
I want Barney Rubble hawking them for me on TV.
</P>
<P>
Look, maybe you can get away with plastering Barney's homely mug on
a children's vitamin.
</P>
<P>
But seeing it on a pair of Michelin P215/70SR14's is not going to
fill the average tire customer with confidence.
</P>
<P>
This is probably neither here nor there, but I find this whole
outbreak of Flintstones mania puzzling, since the original TV series
wasn't that hot to begin with.
</P>
<P>
Let's face it, Bedrock itself was a nothing little burg. A rock
quarry, 20 or 30 dreary ranchers with a quarter-acre of property, that
was about it.
</P>
<P>
What was it Gertrude Stein said about Oakland: ``There's no there
there''?
</P>
<P>
Look, Oakland is Paris in the springtime compared with Bedrock.
</P>
<P>
Plus, let's face it, Fred was an unbelievably dense human being who
always seemed as if he'd just had an anvil dropped on his head.
</P>
<P>
Wilma's voice sounded like a heavy appliance being dragged across
linoleum. Betty could fill out a saber-toothed-tiger skin but seemed
to operate in a giggly haze of prescription sedatives.
</P>
<P>
And Barney ... Barney was nothing more than a yes-man for Fred.
Barney had no backbone. If Fred said jump, Barney said: ``How high?''
</P>
<P>
Don't get me started on those bratty kids, either. Pebbles, Bam-Bam
... this is why they used to build reform schools.
</P>
<P>
The thing is, I'll probably end up seeing ``The Flintstones'' like
every other sucker.
</P>
<P>
I'll pony up 350 bucks, or whatever it costs to drag three kids to
see a movie these days.
</P>
<P>
Then I'll settle back with a big tub of popcorn soaked in
artery-clogging coconut oil to see what all the fuss is about.
</P>
<P>
I will not, however, be buying any Barney Rubble radials.

 WORDS: Sometimes the Plurals Can Confuse Peoples 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United Nations allocated monies so that ships sailing through
international waters could supply peoples around the world with food.
</P>
<P>
This description of a hypothetical act of mercy may make you
exclaim, ``Mercy! I knew the U.N. was pluralistic, but why so many
plurals? Why not just say `money,' `water' and `people'?'' True
enough, there's rarely a need to pluralize these collective nouns.
</P>
<P>
But when they are pluralized, it changes their meaning.
</P>
<P>
The use of ``moneys'' (or ``monies''), for instance, implies that
the moola in question has either been acquired from several sources or
distributed to several different recipients.
</P>
<P>
``Moneys'' is most often used when referring to spending by
governments, corporations or international agencies. Thus, when there
are two or more winners in a state lottery drawing, the lucky ticket
holders could justifiably sing in unison, ``We're in the monies!''
</P>
<P>
Although some say that ``monies'' is not a proper plural because
there's no singular ``mony,'' (please, no letters from the public
relations department at Mutual of New York claiming otherwise), a tidy
sum of others, believing that pluralization is a money-splendored
thing, say ``monies'' is on the ``money.''
</P>
<P>
Now let's sail into troubled ``waters.'' ``Waters,'' of course, can
simply be the plural of ``water.'' ``I don't want any of these
waters,'' your son whines at midnight, rejecting the five glasses that
you, the Father of Waters, and your wife ``Mrs. Sippie,'' have
dutifully delivered to his bedside.
</P>
<P>
But ``waters'' also carries three specific meanings: any body of
water (``Cayuga's waters''), a stretch of ocean under a political
jurisdiction (``international waters'') or the mineral water at a spa.
(Thus, Humphrey Bogart was not misinformed, at least grammatically
speaking, when he said, ``I came to Casablanca for the waters.'')
</P>
<P>
As for ``peoples,'' this word refers not to people in general, but
to a collection of entire cultures, religions and nations, such as the
Ashanti people, the Navajo people and the French people. Thus, the
phrase ``supply peoples around the world'' implies that assistance is
being given to people of many distinct cultures.
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, to paraphase Barbra Streisand, there are ``peoples who
need people.''

 Italy, the Forgotten Front 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A week from Monday, all eyes will be on Normandy for the 50th
anniversary of one of history's great moments, D-Day. Now, here's a
question: What important 50th anniversary will occur two days earlier,
on June 4?
</P>
<P>
You're hesitating. Nobody else seems to remember either. It's the
Allied liberation of Rome, the first enemy capital to fall.
</P>
<P>
Both events are related. The final drive to Rome, and even the date
it occurred, had a lot to do with Normandy. By keeping large German
forces busy in Italy, Allied troops -- at great cost to themselves -- 
permitted the gigantic Normandy buildup to proceed. At the same time,
the Allied high command in Italy was determined to grab world
attention in the hours before the landings in France would wipe the
Italian campaign off the front pages.
</P>
<P>
At that stage of the war, hopes were high that the twin blows
within 48 hours on two major battlefields would hasten Germany's
collapse. Of course, that did not happen. It took almost another year
to reach V-E Day.
</P>
<P>
So today Italy has become the Forgotten Front. Tens of thousands of
veterans, families and friends are expected to pack the Normandy
beaches to celebrate that anniversary. But hardly anyone will notice a
smaller gathering in Rome on Saturday at which survivors of the
Italian campaign commemorate the occasion.
</P>
<P>
-O- 
</P>
<P>
Let's look back. From the fall of '43 through half of '44,
thousands of GIs spent bloody months battling Italy's ``mud, mules and
mountains'' as well as Germans. A lot of our guys are still there, in
a handful of eerily quiet cemeteries.
</P>
<P>
As early as September of '43, Allied strategy included an attempt
to reach Rome. The Italian military chiefs had decided to depose
Mussolini and desert their Nazi partners, and they desperately wanted
help against expected German vengeance when the double-cross became
public. During secret negotiations that summer, the Allies agreed to
drop the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division on Rome hours before Allied
forces began the invasion of Italy at Salerno 200 miles south of the
capital.
</P>
<P>
Determined to learn whether the Italians could protect his troops,
Maj. Gen. Matthew Ridgway, the paratroop commander, had his deputy,
Brig. Gen. Maxwell Taylor, slip secretly into Rome. At midnight, a few
hours before Ridgway's scheduled takeoff from Sicily, Taylor woke up
the new head of government, Marshal Pietro Badoglio. The sleepy
Badoglio confirmed the worst: The Germans had seized control of Rome
and the American paratroopers faced slaughter by some of Hitler's
toughest battalions.
</P>
<P>
As the clock ticked toward H-Hour, Taylor's alarming message was
relayed to Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower; Ike ordered the mission aborted,
but Ridgway could not be reached at his Sicily headquarters. Ridgway
began launching his paratroop-laden planes.
</P>
<P>
But almost by a miracle, the cancellation message found him in time
to call his boys back. ``It was a goddam close all,'' one participant
in the drama recalled.
</P>
<P>
Eisenhower later commented about Taylor's mission into Rome: ``The
risks he ran were greater than I asked any other agent or emissary to
undertake during the war . ... Every minute (he) was in imminent
danger of discovery and death.''
</P>
<P>
After a desperate battle on the Salerno beaches, the invasion
forces managed to move ahead and capture Naples in October. But German
defenses stiffened during a deadly fall and winter. In January, the
Allies carried out a successful end run with an amphibious landing at
Anzio, but over-cautious leadership kept them pinned down for the next
four months. Finally, in May, they broke out of the Anzio beachhead
and began the race for Rome. Allied strategy called for British troops
to advance into and through the capital while American troops pursued
and cut off the retreating Germans.
</P>
<P>
But the 5th Army commander, Lt. Gen. Mark Clark, wanted Rome for
the Americans -- and above all for himself. An astute practitioner of
public relations, he ordered the main body of U.S. forces to change
course and speed to Rome.
</P>
<P>
Maj. Gen. Geoffrey Keyes candidly told the Associated Press why
Clark was in such a big hurry. ``France is going to be invaded, and
we've got to get this in the papers before then.'' When a unit
commander insisted his men would need the rest of the day to overcome
German artillery, Keyes told him, ``That will not do. General Clark
must be across the city limits by 4 o'clock.'' ``Why?'' he was asked.
``Because he has to have a photograph taken.'' Clark reached the
photogenic heights of Capitoline Hill in time to pose for pictures.
</P>
<P>
On June 6, when a subordinate woke him up to give him the first
bulletins of the Normandy landings, Clark was heard to grumble,
``Those SOBs -- can't they even let us have the headlines for one
day!''
</P>
<P>
Clark's actions still cause controversy, bringing bitter criticism
that he had sacrificed the opportunity to destroy German forces for
the prestige and publicity of being first into Rome.
</P>
<P>
-O- 
</P>
<P>
I was one of six Army reporters for the GI newspaper Stars 
Stripes who came into the city on the heels of the entering troops. We
rushed over to Rome's leading daily, Il Messaggero, and asked the
staff to help us put out a paper. They were delighted but confessed
they didn't know any English. We admitted we didn't know any Italian
either.
</P>
<P>
So while the fighting soldiers chased the Germans out of Rome, we
writing soldiers went to work, filling the paper with our stories and
accounts by civilian correspondents. As copies rolled off the presses,
we grabbed them and stood out on the broad, sunny boulevards of the
Eternal City, handing them out to surprised GIs.
</P>
<P>
Before the last German was gone from Rome, we had published the
first issue of the Rome edition of Stars Stripes, under the
headline, in big type, ``WE'RE IN ROME.'' The next day, June 6, world
headlines exploded with Normandy landings, and our Stars Stripes, in
type twice as big as the day before, screamed, ``INVASION.''
</P>
<P>
In those heady days it seemed reasonable to link the double
Rome-Normandy punch to a quick end of the war. A soldier in a weapons
carrier put it this way: ``It won't be long now till Jerry gives in, I
hope. Rome and the Second Front will be too much for him.''
</P>
<P>
An Italian government official enthused: ``In three or four months
 -- finito! Now is a circle around Germany -- in Russia, Italy and
France.''
</P>
<P>
But in fact the capture of the first enemy capital dwindled into a
one-day story. The sizable press corps following the Italian campaign
began to melt away, heading for Normandy. In coming months, with Lt.
Gen. George Patton's tanks blasting into Germany and a new invasion on
the southern shores of France, the grinding war of attrition in
northern Italy disappeared from public view. And so it has remained.
</P>
<P>
Even during this 50th anniversary commemoration of World War II,
Italy is virtually ignored. One list of ceremonies around the world
grouped the fall of Rome with events in tiny Luxembourg and Poland -- 
where no Americans fought. But veterans of the Italian campaign are
hoping for a pleasant change. With President Clinton's decision to
visit Rome and Anzio -- his only appearances outside Normandy -- the
``Forgotten Front'' will be remembered, at least for a day or two.
</P>
<P>
-O- 
</P>
<P>
(Paul Green, a former U.S. Senate staff member, represents Stars 
Stripes on the Rome 1994 Committee, composed of units from the Italian
campaign that will commemorate the 50th anniversary in Rome on
Saturday.)

 Jovial, Avuncular Gibbons Poised to Take Over Ways 
 and Means (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., agonizes over legal problems that threaten to
end his political career, his likely successor, Rep. Sam Gibbons,
D-Fla., has spent the week mending fences with the White House and
sending unmistakable signals to his colleagues that he is anxious and
ready to take charge.
</P>
<P>
The jovial, avuncular Gibbons's laid back political style and
differing views on health care reform have left the White House and
congressional Democratic leaders uneasy in recent days, as they
contemplate the political realities of a post-Rostenkowski era.
Without Rostenkowski at the helm, some fear, the Ways and Means
Committee could badly splinter and President Clinton's health care
initiatives could flounder.
</P>
<P>
``He's completely unengaged,'' complained an aide to the House
Democratic leadership. ``He's a nice guy and a smart guy, but he's
someone who hasn't put a lot of time into helping to organize in the
House.''
</P>
<P>
But Gibbons, 74, a former Florida state legislator and decorated
World War II veteran, insists that his critics have underestimated his
organizational skills, dating to his work on President Lyndon B.
Johnson's war on poverty legislation.
</P>
<P>
He assured the president and Hillary Rodham Clinton in separate
conversations this week that he would set aside his own views on
reforming the health care system and vigorously push for passage of
the president's plan before Congress adjourns this fall. ``There's no
doubt about it, I'm totally on board,'' Gibbons said in an interview.
``The committee knows it, the Clintons know it and my district knows
it.''
</P>
<P>
Gibbons co-sponsored legislation to create a national system of
government-paid health coverage through the Medicare program, a
single-payer plan, contrasted with Clinton's approach, which relies on
employer mandates for funding.
</P>
<P>
Gibbons's bubbly enthusiasm and eagerness to take the committee's
reins has struck some of Rostenkowski's closest allies as a bit
unseemly in light of the chairman's serious legal problems that
potentially could lead to a prison sentence. But after 32 years in
Congress, Gibbons, like other longtime veterans, believes he is
entitled to his day in the sun.
</P>
<P>
``There's a deep regret my time had to come on the footsteps of
someone else's travail,'' Gibbons said. ``I like Rosty, admire his
ability as a legislator. He's been very friendly with me and very
supportive of some of the things I've done. My heart bleeds for him
and his family.''
</P>
<P>
This week sources described the chances of Rostenkowski accepting a
plea agreement as increasingly unlikely. Rostenkowski, who is said to
be leaning toward fighting a lengthy court battle, may reach a
decision on whether to accept a plea agreement by the weekend, the
sources said. U.S. Attorney Eric H. Holder Jr. has given the veteran
lawmaker until Tuesday to accept a guilty plea to at least one felony
and jail time or face almost certain indictment.
</P>
<P>
Since the voters of Tampa, Fla., first sent Gibbons to the House in
1962, he has aspired to lead the Ways and Means Committee, which has
jurisdiction over taxes, trade, Social Security, Medicare and more
than half of federal spending. A moderate on most social issues,
Gibbons is more conservative on economic matters.
</P>
<P>
As chairman of the subcommittee on trade, he became a leading
advocate of free trade -- often an unpopular stance among House
Democrats that became more fashionable with Clinton's election.
</P>
<P>
Not until recently -- after Rostenkowski's legal problems escalated
and other senior committee members indicated they would not attempt to
challenge Gibbons -- did it become clear that Gibbons would likely
fulfill his wish to lead the committee.
</P>
<P>
Two senior Democratic members of Ways and Means, Reps. Charles B.
Rangel (N.Y.), a committee powerhouse, and Fortney ``Pete'' Stark
(Calif.), a leader in the health care reform debate, this week
endorsed Gibbons for the post if Rostenkowski is forced to step aside.
</P>
<P>
``I would think he would be a good presider over the committee who
would play by the rules,'' Stark said. ``Danny played by the rules
too, but those two are very different, and the committee will operate
differently -- but I'm just not sure how.''
</P>
<P>
But others warn that without the powerful Rostenkowski in command,
the subcommittees may assume greater influence, diffusing power, which
could compound the difficulty of passing out controversial
legislation.
</P>
<P>
Though his detractors compare his style unfavorably to that of
Rostenkowski, who for years forged deals within the delicately
balanced committee through a combination of patience, cajoling and
occasional bullying, Gibbons is no shrinking violet. Fifty years ago,
he parachuted behind enemy lines as part of the first wave of the
allied forces' D-Day invasion of France, eluded 15 German soldiers and
then pulled together enough U.S. soldiers to secure the Douve River
near the French town of Ste. Mere-Eglise. The young Army officer
carried two cans of Schlitz beer in his backpack and shared them with
two other soldiers.
</P>
<P>
``A warm beer on a cool morning on an empty stomach,'' Gibbons
recalled this week.
</P>
<P>
Clinton selected Gibbons to represent him during part of the 50th
anniversary commemoration of the invasion, beginning this weekend.
Gibbons met with the president and historians Tuesday at the White
House to recall his part in the invasion.
</P>
<P>
As the session ended,, Clinton treated Gibbons to a surprise: Two
Schlitz delivered on a silver tray.

 Paying an Annual Fee of 1 Percent 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tired of paying a 4 percent or 5 percent upfront commission when
you buy a mutual fund from your broker? Weary of worrying about
withdrawal charges if you want to leave your fund before you've been
in there for five or six years? If so, I've got some good news for
you.
</P>
<P>
The mutual-fund industry is quickly marching down the path to a new
kind of fund share, called the C share, or ``level-load'' share. When
you buy a level-load share, you don't pay an upfront commission or
face a withdrawal charge. Instead, you simply pay the fund an annual
fee of 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The new C shares join two older types of broker-sold fund shares,
now called A and B shares. To counter growing confusion about fund
shares, the industry recently designated shares as Class A, B, C or D,
depending on the sales charges and fees involved.
</P>
<P>
The A share, which is the traditional front-end ``load'' share,
comes with the unnerving sight of a broker slicing off a 4 or 5
percent commission before money is even invested.
</P>
<P>
The B shares were created to avoid that pain and to allow an
investor to keep his or her original investment intact. The B shares,
however, have early-withdrawal charges and so-called 12b-1 fees, used
to pay brokers' commissions. The costs of A and B shares tend to even
out after eight years.
</P>
<P>
The emergence of C shares, according to fund executives, recognizes
that many investors still resist paying commissions to buy mutual
funds. C shares thus charge only an annual fee. The biggest advantage
of C shares is that they give investors the freedom to change their
minds about where they want to keep their money without paying a
penalty. Any investor who tends to be uncertain about his or her fund
investments will understand how comforting it is to have that freedom.
</P>
<P>
William E. Chapman, the executive vice president for marketing at
Kemper Mutual Funds, which is adding C shares, said he thought they
would appeal to investors in the same way some motorists prefer to
lease a car rather than buy. Leasing, he noted, might be a better deal
for a motorist who wanted the car for only a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
While only a few companies have offered level-load shares up to
now, that is changing. Just last week, Kemper and another major fund
groups said they were getting into the level-load business. The
Calvert Group, which runs a family of social investment funds, added
level-load shares to its stock and bond funds.
</P>
<P>
Kemper said it was combining two groups of funds and, henceforth,
21 funds would offer investors three kinds of shares. The shares are
similar to those offered by many companies that sell funds through
brokers. These are the Kemper offerings:
</P>
<P>
-- Class A shares. The investor pays a maximum upfront commission or
load of 5.75 percent. The amount is deducted before the money is
invested.
</P>
<P>
-- Class B shares. There is no upfront load. However, an investor
who leaves the fund before the end of six years will pay a declining
withdrawal charge, which starts at 4 percent and goes down to zero.
(If you leave after six years, you pay no withdrawal charge.)
</P>
<P>
The investor also pays an ongoing 0.75 percent a year charge, known
as a 12b-1 fee (used to pay brokers), plus a 0.25 percent service fee
 -- a total of 1 percent. At the end of six years, the B shares convert
to A shares and the 12b-1 fee is dropped.
</P>
<P>
-- Class C shares. There is no upfront sales charge or withdrawal
fee, only an ongoing fee totaling 1 percent a year. This is composed
of a 0.75 percent 12b-1 charge and a 0.25 percent service fee.
</P>
<P>
Kemper says these ``pay as you go'' shares are advantageous for
investors who are likely to stay in a fund for only three or four
years. An investor who stayed in a level-load fund for 10 years would
wind up paying more than an investor in either an A share or B share
fund.
</P>
<P>
As for brokers, C shares will give them their commissions over a
period of years, instead of when they sell a fund. Some fund officials
hope the greater ease of selling level-load shares will encourage
brokers to accept delayed payments.
</P>
<P>
(The mutual-fund industry also has created a D class share, which
is a lot like a C class, or level-load, share. However, a D share
could also carry a small upfront sales charge. But that's a story for
another day.)
</P>
<P>
At Calvert, Vice President Steven J. Schueth said his company
adopted level-load shares to help brokers compete with no-load funds,
which sell by mail or phone and have no sales charges. ``The concept
of level-load is not only here to stay but it is a trend that will
pick up speed over the next couple years,'' Schueth said.
</P>
<P>
Chapman said Kemper felt it was important, in a competitive market,
to give investors as many choices as possible.
</P>
<P>
However, the level-load business may have potential hazards for
investors and fund companies.
</P>
<P>
The danger to the investor involves full disclosure. The level-load
share allows a broker to say: ``This fund has no sales charges.'' But
it won't be the whole story. The broker also must tell the investor:
As long as you are in the fund, you will pay at least a 1 percent
yearly charge, on top of the fund's regular management fees.
</P>
<P>
The danger to the fund company is that level-load investors will
make too much use of their freedom to go in and out of the funds. Some
observers have suggested these movements, especially during periods of
market crisis, could require fund managers to hold cash to meet
redemptions and possibly to sell securities into a declining market.
That could prove costly to other shareholders.
</P>
<P>
At Kemper, Chapman agreed level-load shareholders might be quicker
to change than others but said he did not think it would be a problem
for managers.
</P>
<P>
A recent study by Lipper Analytical Services Inc. of how bond-fund
investors behaved during April lends some credence to the idea that
level-load shareholders are likely to flee faster than other
shareholders when markets encounter turbulence.
</P>
<P>
With interest rates rising and bond values falling, investors took
more money out of bond funds in April than they put in. Lipper's study
found that level-load investors were the most active group of
redeemers, compared with investors who held A or B shares.
</P>
<P>
Clearly, one of the major marketing themes of this age is to give
people more choices -- whether it is ice cream, yellow pages or mutual
funds. The new level-load shares give investors a chance to change
their minds -- without paying a penalty. And that's a great choice.

 DOT Inspector Making Her Mark on The FAA (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Quick. Name the inspector general at the Department of
Transportation.
</P>
<P>
Name one at any agency.
</P>
<P>
Known mostly to government bureaucrats and congressional oversight
committees, the average ``IG'' is an anonymous person looking over the
shoulders of mostly anonymous government decision makers, regulators
and contractors. It's one of those nameless, faceless, but very
powerful jobs in Washington.
</P>
<P>
But A. Mary Schiavo, 38, inspector general at DOT since 1990, is
making a name for herself, especially with the Federal Aviation
Administration.
</P>
<P>
In the last year, the IG's office at DOT has changed its focus from
auditing obscure DOT contracts and programs to overseeing major
programs and investigating safety-related issues. She says the new
areas were ``big holes'' in past IGs' patrolling of the department's
halls.
</P>
<P>
Though her staff has been reduced, Schiavo has issued 2,456 audit
reports and has reeled in 149 indictments and 95 convictions -- 
aggressive growth in the number of cases being pursued.
</P>
<P>
Much of this attention has gone to the FAA. Subjects include: How
the FAA makes sure that only approved parts are used in aircraft
maintenance and repair (Schiavo's high-profile ``bogus parts''
investigations); security at airports; a delayed computer
modernization program; aircraft and pilot inspections; and how the FAA
manages its fleet of vehicles (she believes poorly).
</P>
<P>
It's not that the FAA disagrees with all her findings. But it has
complained about the quality of some of her work. The agency also
points out that there has never been a crash of a major airliner
related to ``bad'' parts and has sent her a 67-page response saying it
continued to ``non-concur with many of the recommendations.''
</P>
<P>
And she was overruled by the Office of Government Ethics on a
finding she made in a controversial case involving whether Frank
Lorenzo, fallen airline empire builder, should fly again. Schiavo, a
licensed pilot and a seasoned prosecutor (most of her predecessors
were auditors), is unfazed. ``We don't just want to be the time and
attendance cops,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
-- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Wendell H. Ford, D-Ky., an influential member of the Committee
on Commerce, Science and Transportation, has put the brakes on the
nomination of Ricardo Martinez as National Highway Transportation
Safety administrator.
</P>
<P>
Using one of the Senate's most time-tested delay tactics, Ford
placed a ``hold'' on Martinez's nomination, which the Clinton
administration advanced several months ago. Mark L. Day, a spokesman
for Ford, had no comment on the delay; administration officials
backing Martinez were similarly mum.
</P>
<P>
That hasn't stopped the rumor mill. Speculation within the
administration and on Capitol Hill is that Ford, who is from the
bourbon state, believes Martinez will be tough on drinking and driving
due to his experience as an emergency-room physician in California and
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Others suggest a deal is in the making between Ford and
Transportation Secretary Federico Pena over doing a few things for
Delta Air Lines Inc. in Kentucky. What kinds of things? No one's
saying.
</P>
<P>
``He wanted to get Pena's attention, and he got it by holding up
Martinez's nomination,'' one government source said.
</P>
<P>
-- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
And the DOT gets the award for press release of the week. Its
Maritime Administration, which is filled with knowledgeable old sea
dogs, described the design on a new commemorative flag as ``an eagle,
perched on a red, white and blue shield, and a fouled anchor.''
</P>
<P>
And what does ``fouled'' mean? Especially with an eagle nearby?
``Twisted,'' said a Maritime spokeswoman. As in a rope draped around
the anchor.

 `Flintstones': Stone Age Bomb (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
``The Flintstones,'' a $45 million dinosaur that hired
no fewer than 36 screenwriters and stars John Goodman, Rick Moranis,
Elizabeth Perkins and Rosie O'Donnell, isn't just awful. It bombs
itself into the Stone Age. As Fred Flintstone might have put it:
yabba-dabba-boo.
</P>
<P>
After faithfully duplicating the TV show's familiar opening
sequence -- in which Fred Flintstone (Goodman) knocks off work, howls
for joy, slides down his Bronto-crane tail and foot-shuffles away in
his prehistoric car -- the movie suffers immediate comic extinction.
Leadenly directed and almost soberly scripted, it never captures the
campy brightness of the original series -- the herky-jerky animation,
the wacky sound effects, the distinctive character voices and that
cheesy laugh track.
</P>
<P>
In the third-rate plot (and there's no telling who among the
Flintstone 36 came up with this gem), scheming boss Cliff Vandercave
(Kyle MacLachlan) and his comely secretary (Halle Berry) promote
unsuspecting Fred as a vice president, then frame him for
embezzlement, intending to abscond with the ill-gotten profit. Fred,
enjoying a life of unprecedented luxury, is obliged to fire Barney
(Moranis) and watch his friend sink into poverty before realizing his
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
If the performers are imitating their cartoon forebears, it is
barely apparent. Goodman's sweat-induced, growly offerings completely
bypass Fred's lovable, pigheaded innocence. The actor never attains
Fred's gravelly timbre. And with his blond-dyed hair and zombielike
demeanor, Moranis seems more like a zoned-out Warhol groupie than
Fred's perky buddy.
</P>
<P>
The greatest asset of Perkins's Wilma is that Perkins looks the
part. O'Donnell's dead-on Betty Rubble giggle is the funniest thing in
the movie, but it merely underlines how bad everyone -- and everything
 -- else is around her: The child actors who play Bamm-Bamm and Pebbles
are completely forgettable. Fred's pet dinosaur Dino, with its chintzy
eyes and unconvincing animatronic gyrations, looks like a low-budget
Muppet. And even Elizabeth Taylor, trundled out to play Fred's
insulting mother-in-law, falls disappointingly short of imperious. She
isn't exactly helped by the mediocre bones the screenplay tosses her
way.
</P>
<P>
While the movie -- officially scripted by Steven E. de Souza, Tom
Parker and Jim Jennewein -- labors through its primeval ooze, it churns
out incessant, dull visual gags, including a
Stonehenge-meets-'50s-America and the ``pigasaurus'' creature under
the sink that serves as a garbage disposal. It also heaves out unfunny
Hollywood ``inside'' jokes: The movie opens with a ``Steven Spielrock
Presents'' credit; Halle Berry's character is named Sharon Stone;
George Lucas's ``Tar Wars'' is playing at the local theater. When,
inevitably, Fred -- locked out of the house by his pet saber-toothed
tiger -- thumps the door and yells ``Wilma!'', it doesn't bring ``The
Flintstones'' to a triumphant close. It just sets the audience free.

 Stopping by the Palace for a Sip of Royal Tea (Tokyo) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hushed and respectful, wearing our best suits, nervously
reviewing our lessons on imperial etiquette, we stood stiffly at our
assigned spots on the thick green carpet of the elegant reception
chamber. Suddenly, the rice-paper doors slid open, and muffled steps
could be heard coming down the long palace corridor. ``Remember,'' an
earnest gentleman from the Imperial Household Agency hissed, ``this is
a social occasion.''
</P>
<P>
Well, sort of.
</P>
<P>
With final preparations underway for their 16-day royal visit to
the United States next month, Japan's soft-spoken Emperor Akihito and
his wife, the even softer-spoken Empress Michiko, invited a group of
American journalists beneath the graceful fluted roofs of the Imperial
Palace Friday to share a few sips of royal tea and a few words with
royalty.
</P>
<P>
Before the tea party, the reporters were required to attend a
one-hour lecture on court history and protocol by the vice grand
master of ceremony, who sternly adjured us not to carry cameras,
recorders or even notebooks into the royal presence. Throughout the
40-minute session with the emperor and empress, an extremely uptight
corps of courtiers and palace bureaucrats kept prodding and poking at
us to make sure we stood only in the right places and spoke only at
the right times.
</P>
<P>
And yet the handsome, stylish imperial couple radiated such regal
charm and aplomb that they managed to give the imperial tea the
feeling of a ``social occasion'' after all.
</P>
<P>
Relaxed and natty in his trademark double-breasted suit, with a
pure white handkerchief folded into three perfect peaks in his breast
pocket, the gray-haired Akihito -- now in his sixth year on the
Chrysanthemum Throne, embodying the world's oldest ancestral monarchy
 -- seemed considerably more at ease than he had at a similar occasion
four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Even when the conversation turned to delicate political matters,
the 60-year-old emperor was unfazed. He spoke an ordinary,
easy-to-understand Japanese sharply different from the arcane court
language employed by his royal ancestors.
</P>
<P>
Akihito was asked, of course, about the decision by Japan's
political leadership to cancel a scheduled imperial visit to Pearl
Harbor. That stop was removed from the royal schedule for fear of a
political backlash from right-wing elements here, who insist Japan
owes no apology to the United States for World War II.
</P>
<P>
In reply, Akihito noted calmly that he is a strictly symbolic
monarch under Japan's postwar constitution. The elected government
decides his travel schedule, he added, and he of course will do what
the government tells him.
</P>
<P>
The empress, meanwhile -- standing across the room in a pale green
kimono with wispy orange and white wildflowers painted along the
lavish obi, or belt -- put on an even more impressive performance.
</P>
<P>
The past year or so has been one of the most trying for Michiko,
59, since her marriage 36 years ago. In an unprecedented display of
public ``disrespect,'' the empress was criticized in several national
magazines.
</P>
<P>
The complaints were minor, even trivial -- but they were considered
shocking in a nation that reveres its royalty. The empress collapsed
last fall and lost the ability to speak. Court officials blamed this
mysterious malady on ``deep sadness'' because of the bad press.
</P>
<P>
It has been only a matter of weeks since Michiko fully regained her
speech. But she did just fine Friday, chatting easily, if softly, in
clear English with just a few worried glances over her shoulder at the
official interpreter.
</P>
<P>
It would be bad form -- not to mention a violation of the ground
rules -- to quote what their majesties had to say. Let it suffice that
they are aware of current economic friction between the world's two
richest nations and hope their trip in June will help ease tension in
the U.S.-Japan relationship.
</P>
<P>
Both emperor and empress spoke fondly of previous trips to the
United States. Akihito said he still has vivid memories of a visit to
Washington decades ago, when he first saw the beautiful array of
national monuments lined up along the Mall. He also recalls an auto
trip through the vastness of northern Wyoming, when the royal
motorcade passed only two other cars in the course of a four-hour
drive. In the entire Japanese archipelago, there is nothing
approaching such wide open spaces.
</P>
<P>
But if the royal couple handled this social occasion with grace,
the phalanx of ladies-in-waiting, stewards, palace bureaucrats, maids
and butlers spent the afternoon in a twitter making sure every detail
of the tea party was exactly in place.
</P>
<P>
Some 40 minutes before the session was to begin, we were ushered
into a large and tastefully opulent room where the green carpet was
offset by a high ceiling of polished blond cedar and walls made of
rice-paper shoji screens that muted the sunlight outside to the soft
glow characteristic of older Japanese homes.
</P>
<P>
We were told precisely where to stand, precisely where to clip on
our name tags and precisely how to greet the royal couple (with
Western-style handshakes rather than Japanese-style bows).
</P>
<P>
As the emperor and empress approached each of us, a courtier with a
booming voice called out an identification. This introduction focused
on the things that matter in Japan, group affiliation and title, with
the individual's name thrown in as an afterthought: ``The Washington
Post newspaper, bureau chief, Reid-san.''
</P>
<P>
But as we sipped our tea from delicate china cups, stirring the
liquid with sterling spoons bearing the 16-petal chrysanthemum crest
that only the imperial family can use, the royal couple seemed to make
everything copacetic. ``I wish we could get together more often,'' the
empress said -- and sounded like she really meant it.

 Emperor's Pearl Harbor Visit Canceled (Tokyo) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Japan's Cabinet Friday approved the schedule for Emperor
Akihito's state visit to the United States next month, but canceled,
as expected, a planned visit to the Pearl Harbor memorial in Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
The Pearl Harbor stop sparked political controversy here because
some right-wing nationalists fear an imperial visit would be construed
as an apology for the sneak attack on Dec. 7, 1941, that pulled the
United States into World War II. As a compromise, the Cabinet decided
Akihito will stop at the Punch Bowl military cemetery in Honolulu,
where he will lay a wreath in honor of American war dead.
</P>
<P>
Akihito and Empress Michiko will spend four nights in Washington
during the 16-day trip, from June 11-15. They will be the guests of
honor at President Clinton's first state dinner on June 13.
</P>
<P>
The royal couple will also visit Atlanta; Charleston, S.C.;
Charlottesville, Va.; New York; St. Louis; Denver; Los Angeles; and
San Francisco.

 Salute Standoff Dramatizes Gap in Perceptions Between U.N. 
 Officers, Bosnian Military Men (Travnik) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
TRAVNIK, Bosnia-Herzegovina
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, the commander
of U.N. troops in Bosnia, took a delegation of NATO officers to meet
Gen. Mehmed Aligic earlier this week. At the appointed time, the
Bosnian Muslim general burst into the room, sucked in his formidable
gut and jerked his right hand into a snappy salute.
</P>
<P>
Nonplussed, Rose extended his arm to shake Aligic's hand. The U.N.
commander, a by-the-books British officer, does not salute a man with
no hat. But Aligic -- Bosnian rascal, lover of women and drink,
gloriously incorrect and one of the most successful military leaders
of the mostly Muslim Bosnian army -- refused to shake.
</P>
<P>
The NATO commander for southern Europe, U.S. Navy Adm. Leighton
Smith, stepped in and saved everyone a bit of face, participants in
the meeting recalled. Looser American rules allow hatless salutes.
Aligic, his salute returned and his pride intact, settled into his
seat and the meeting began.
</P>
<P>
The fleeting standoff in this beautiful Bosnian town, which
reclines along the Lavsa River valley like, Nobel Prize-winning
novelist Ivo Andric once wrote, ``the pages of a half-opened book,''
dramatized a yawning gap in understanding between officers of the U.N.
operation here and the military men of the warring Bosnian factions
that have brought Europe its bloodiest conflict since World War II.
Denizens of different cultures and different worlds, using different
maps to fight different wars according to different rules, they can
neither shake hands nor salute when they meet.
</P>
<P>
The ramifications of this gap in perception are significant,
affecting everything in Bosnia from the peace process in Geneva to
cease-fire agreements on the ground. It is one of the reasons why what
seems to be a step toward peace in the United Nations' eyes can, in
other eyes, turn out to be a stumble toward more war.
</P>
<P>
Rose, born 53 years ago in Quetta, then a British colonial garrison
town in what is now Pakistan, cites the Prussian military thinker Karl
von Clausewitz to sum up his evaluation of this conflict. ``The war,''
he said with the firm belief of a former war college commandant
schooled in the unassailable logic of NATO strategy, ``has long ago
reached its limit of exploitation.''
</P>
<P>
Aligic, 47, part Turkish vizier, part Communist commissar, trained
in the arts of protracted struggle in a culture where Occident and
Orient collide, where black marketeering verges on virtue and tending
the graves of ancestors constitutes a duty, begs to disagree.
</P>
<P>
``We don't make war here on the basis of West Point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Rose predicted, for example, that his masterpiece, a successful
cease-fire around Sarajevo that rode on the back of a NATO ultimatum
last February, would spread rapidly across Bosnia. Instead, it was
followed by a decision by Bosnian Serb military leader Ratko Mladic to
attack the U.N. ``safe area'' of Gorazde, precipitating another
crisis.
</P>
<P>
One of the great successes of the U.N. operation in Bosnia,
hammered out in tandem with U.S. diplomatic efforts, was the March
peace settlement between Croat and Muslim factions that fought a
vicious war for more than a year in central Bosnia in parallel with
the main conflict pitting the Muslim-led government against Serb
secessionists.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. John McColl, commander of British forces in the region,
Rose and the U.S. diplomats and military officers who brokered the
accord saw it as the beginning of a process that would spread into the
72 percent of Bosnia held by the Serbs. Charles E. Redman, U.S.
special envoy to the Bosnian peace talks, says that now that Muslims
and Croats have stopped fighting they should sign a peace agreement
that would give them 51 percent of the country and the Serbs 49
percent.
</P>
<P>
But Aligic commands a corps of Bosnian fighters at least half of
whom lost their homes in Serb expulsion campaigns known as ``ethnic
cleansing.'' His eyes, therefore, tend to see the Muslim-Croat deal
not as a harbinger of peace but as the facilitator of more war.
</P>
<P>
``The federation means open roads. Open roads mean guns. And that
means my men can go home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
While Rose was telling Aligic that continuing the war was
``pointless,'' Muslim infantry and Croat tanks were attacking Bosnian
Serb positions near Tesanj, northeast of Travnik, in a joint probe
marking the first time in more than a year that the Croat militia had
fought alongside Muslim forces in central Bosnia. Muslim and Croat
forces also cooperated against Serb fighters around the strategic
Serb-held town of Brcko in northeastern Bosnia earlier this week -- 
with Croat tanks lobbing a few rounds from their positions in Orasje
to the north and Muslim gunners shelling the city from the south.
</P>
<P>
Rose called the fighting ``minor skirmishes.'' Bosnian commanders
view the renewed cooperation as steps toward bigger ones.
</P>
<P>
One of the goals of the Tesanj attack appears to be to cut a road
running south from the Serb-held town of Teslic that supplies Serb
gunners on Mount Vlasic, a strategic peak overlooking Travnik.
Aligic's men recently have attacked Serb positions there. Successful
Muslim-Croat cooperation around Tesanj could bode well for more
Muslim-Croat teamwork around Travnik, Aligic said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. officers and many European diplomats have never taken the
mostly Muslim army seriously. Just last week, Douglas Hogg, Britain's
deputy foreign minister, called on the Muslim government to
acknowledge it had lost the war.
</P>
<P>
In their meeting on Tuesday, Rose told Aligic he would need at
least four years to retake the land he had lost. The Muslim
commander's response was simple: ``The general's mathematics could use
a little work.''

 Solzhenitsyn Returns to Russia (Vladivostok) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
VLADIVOSTOK, Russia
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty years after being stripped of his
citizenship, hustled onto an Aeroflot airliner and sent into unwanted
exile, Alexander Solzhenitsyn returned triumphantly home Friday, eager
to reacquaint himself with a country he acknowledged had been
``altered beyond recognition.''
</P>
<P>
The Nobel Prize winner, who spent the last 18 years living quietly
in southern Vermont, told a crowd of more than 2,000 people gathered
in this port city's main square that Russia had shed communism only to
encounter more hardship.
</P>
<P>
``I never doubted that communism was doomed to collapse, but I
always feared what the price would be,'' he said. ``I know I am coming
to a Russia torn apart, discouraged, stunned. ... I would like to
search with you for ways to get out of the 75 years of our quagmire.''
</P>
<P>
The square in which Solzhenitsyn delivered his address is still
named ``The Fighters for Soviet Power.''
</P>
<P>
Despite a long trip, Solzhenitsyn appeared delighted to be back in
Russia, smiling and waving to the crowd as it applauded and cheered
him. He was then whisked off in a minibus to the Vladivostok Hotel,
which was certain to provide the 75-year-old writer with a quick dose
of new Russian reality: The hotel has not had hot water for days, its
elevators are on the blink, and among the guests are a number of the
tough-looking Russian ``biznessmeni'' who flourish here today.
</P>
<P>
The hotel administration did, however, clear out the miniskirted
women who, according to male visitors, frequently knocked on doors in
the middle of the night, offering their services.
</P>
<P>
Solzhenitsyn flew to Vladivostok from Anchorage, Alaska, with his
wife, Natalya, 54, his youngest son, Stephan, 20, and a horde of
reporters documenting his historic trip home. During a brief refueling
stop in Magadan, the heart of the brutal Soviet prison-camp network
that he documented in his multi-volume account, ``The Gulag
Archipelago,'' he briefly disembarked, reached down to touch the
ground and told reporters, ``I bow my head ... where hundreds of
thousands if not millions of our executed fellow countrymen are
buried.''
</P>
<P>
The writer intends to travel slowly across Russia to see firsthand
a country he has only read and heard about for the past 20 years.
Solzhenitsyn and his wife are having a house built in a leafy district
on the outskirts of Moscow, but their plans to move in have apparently
been delayed by construction problems. The Solzhenitsyns have kept
their home in Cavendish, Vt., for their sons, who are U.S. citizens
and grew up in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Solzhenitsyn told the Russian news agency Tass that he had chosen
this formerly closed port, home to the once mighty Soviet Pacific
Fleet, instead of Moscow because he wanted to hear ordinary Russians
and not those living in a city ``that has been living a privileged
life'' at the expense of the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
There has been extensive coverage of Solzhenitsyn's return in
Russian newspapers, and the local airport erupted in pandemonium
Friday when more than 100 local and foreign journalists and camera
crews broke through a security line and besieged the writer as he
descended from his plane. Solzhenitsyn attempted to calm people,
saying, ``Everyone stop. Take as many pictures of me as you want.''
</P>
<P>
Solzhenitsyn's return is important to Russia not only because he
is, as poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko called him, ``our only living
classic.'' His dissident years and unbending opposition to the Soviet
regime made him a hero to democracy activists. At the same time,
nationalists have hoped to claim him as a standard-bearer thanks to
his championing of the values of Russia's roots and religion and his
calls for a united Slavic nation.
</P>
<P>
In his remarks Friday, and over the past few weeks, Solzhenitsyn
has said he intends to play only a moral or social role in the new
Russia, not a political one. Still, his comments have clearly had a
political edge. He has criticized the economic reforms of President
Boris Yeltsin and his administration for wreaking havoc with people's
lives, denounced the International Monetary Fund, dismissed Ukrainian
nationalist sentiments and called ultranationalist leader Vladimir
Zhirinovsky a ``clown.''
</P>
<P>
He told Tass Friday that his life as a writer is basically complete
and it was time to ``get down to hard work on rebuilding and reviving
Russia.'' Whether Solzhenitsyn will have any impact is unclear. Russia
has changed dramatically in the last three years, and there may be
little room for writer-prophets who offer moral guidance to the
masses.
</P>
<P>
Many Russians, particularly the young, have not read Solzhenitsyn's
books and seem uninterested in his suggestions that Western ways have
polluted Russia.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, many here are clearly searching for someone
untainted by the last few years of chaos and broken promises, a moral
force in a country that is struggling with the loss of all past
certainties. Dissident Nobel Prize-winning physicist Andrei Sakharov
fulfilled that role for many, but since his death in 1989 there has
been no one.
</P>
<P>
Solzhenitsyn, with his Tolstoyan beard and moral rectitude, has the
same aura. He remains a larger-than-life figure for many because of
his willingness to risk all to write the truth about the horrors of
Soviet totalitarianism.
</P>
<P>
For his work, the West gave him the 1970 Nobel Prize for literature
and called him the worthy successor to Tolstoy, Fyodor Dostoyevsky and
Anton Chekhov. His rulers called him a traitor. He was hounded and
harassed, turned into an official non-person, with his books forbidden
and unpublished. In 1974 they forced him into exile, hoping that,
removed from his homeland, his angry, overpowering voice would grow
still. It did not.
</P>
<P>
Solzhenitsyn has described his time in Vermont as his most
productive and peaceful ever. And indeed, when the old treason charges
against him were officially judged ``groundless'' in 1991, following
the failed hard-line Communist coup, he chose not to return
immediately. He wanted first to finish what he says will be his last
work, ``The Red Wheel,'' a massive account of Russian and Soviet
history. Friday night he was finally home.

 Over 35 Doctors Running for Congress (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The hours are just as grueling, the salary's likely to
be lower, and the position comes with a heap of public disdain.
Nonetheless, this year nearly three dozen physicians are trying to
trade their stethoscope and white coat for the job -- a seat in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
The bumper crop of physician-candidates dovetails, of course, with
the Clinton administration's effort to push a national health care
reform plan through Congress. If the practice of medicine is going to
be revolutionized, some physicians want to have a say in it.
</P>
<P>
``If health care were not on the front burner, I don't think I
would be running,'' said surgeon George Craig, a Republican activist
challenging Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., in the primary.
</P>
<P>
Dentist Ron Franks, a Republican from Maryland's Eastern Shore
challenging Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes, D-Md., said he is concerned that
health care policy is being determined without the direct input of
health care professionals. ``I believe that all health care providers
... realize the danger and I plan to invite them to participate in my
campaign,'' he said. Currently only two members of Congress are
physicians -- both in the House -- and one, Rep. J. Roy Rowland, D-Ga.,
is retiring. More than 35 doctors are candidates this year.
</P>
<P>
A study by Congressional Quarterly shows medicine barely edging out
professional sports and acting as prior occupations of members of
Congress. The runaway leader in the breakdown: lawyers.
</P>
<P>
``I think it's incredible that we have 239 attorneys and two
physicians and we're about to write major changes in health care,''
said Wyoming House candidate and ophthalmologist John Herschler, a
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
Sheila McGuire, a dentist and epidemiologist running in Iowa said
as far as she is concerned ``lawyers are well represented in
Congress.'' The problem, she said, is the under representation of
doctors and a lack of familiarity within Congress of the workings of
the health care system.
</P>
<P>
McGuire and Herschler are living the attorney-physician tension in
more ways than one; each is running against a lawyer. Herschler's
opponent is a personal injury lawyer who handles malpractice cases, a
point Herschler enjoys drawing attention to on the stump.
</P>
<P>
But that opponent, Bob Schuster, counters that being a doctor is
not an automatic edge in this year's election, and might even be a
negative. ``If that were a credential to solving the health care
problem, we wouldn't have a health care problem.''
</P>
<P>
McGuire's opponent, Mike Peterson is painfully aware, however, that
doctors carry at least one helpful campaign credential: ``a lot of
personal wealth, plus they've got a lot of friends with personal
wealth.'' Of course, so do many attorneys. But, Peterson said that his
work as a small town attorney and part-time state legislator does not
begin to even the playing field.
</P>
<P>
Doctors are not the only medical candidates this year, There is a
smaller but equally determined pool: nurses.
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Davis Knapp, a nurse running in Florida's 12th Congressional
District, holds that the Founding Fathers intended members of Congress
to be ``everyday working people,'' and that doctors are not that.
</P>
<P>
``Certainly, I don't think most people are in the position of most
doctors. But I think most people are in the positions of . . . nurses,
in terms of finances.''
</P>
<P>
According to the American Nurses Association, the only nurse ever
elected to Congress is freshman Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Texas.
</P>
<P>
The gulf between doctors and nurses extends beyond fiscal matters.
``Most physicians see the system only from one side and that's their
side. ... They've only seen it from their narrow perspective,'' said
nurse practitioner Rita Tamerius, who is running for a California
Houseseat. Tamerius advocates greater utilization of nurses for
primary care, which she says physicians oppose.
</P>
<P>
The nurses and doctors running for Congress realize that health
care expertise does not guarantee victory. ``People hold their own
physician in high esteem but are suspicious of the medical community
as a whole,'' said Rowland, one of the House's two doctors. ``I think
if a physician is known in the area that he or she's running in, that
will be helpful.''
</P>
<P>
Congress's other physician, Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., a leader
in the health care reform debate, reminds physician-candidates of what
they will miss if elected. ``You don't get the immediate
gratification. ... Nobody says thank you the way patients do.''

 Values, Gender Slowly Transform Political Parties (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two years ago, Rep. Karen L. Thurman, D-Fla., a
civic-minded former school teacher with strong political appeal to
women, was part of a Democratic victory march led by female candidates
who appealed to Republican-leaning voters alienated by their party's
anti-abortion stands and its tilt to the right.
</P>
<P>
This year, Florida Republicans will try to overcome the loss of
those voters, especially college-educated working women, with a
candidate whose appeal is geared directly toward a once rock-solid
Democratic electorate of poor and working-class whites, especially
white men.
</P>
<P>
It would be tough, in fact, to pick a Republican more different
from Thurman than the candidate likely to win the GOP nomination in
Florida's 5th Congressional District: Big Daddy Don Garlits, king of
the quarter-mile drag strip.
</P>
<P>
``My family was Democratic going back to the days before the big
Depression. We loved the Democratic Party,'' said Garlits, 62, who has
taken a car from a standing start to 287 mph in 440 yards. ``But
somewhere in the early '60s, they got the idea you didn't have to
work. ... They got on these ideas like there should be no corporal
punishment in the schools, a lot of funny ideas. If you are very young
and have a baby, they give you money for it; and if you have another,
they give you more money.''
</P>
<P>
Citing the Bible and Judeo-Christian principles, Garlits said,
``The man should be the head of the family. I believe that because
he's got the strong hand.'' But, he added, ``Head of the family is one
thing, we are not talking about out in the business world.''
</P>
<P>
Garlits says he is prepared if Thurman attacks him as
``anti-woman.''
</P>
<P>
``I'm going to bring in Shirley Muldowney,'' a three-time drag
strip world champion, Garlits said. ``I'm the guy who first signed her
papers (to enter competition) and I intimidated the other two guys to
sign, so I have always been for women's rights, before it was
politically correct.''
</P>
<P>
The Thurman-Garlits contest is an extreme example of the slow
transformation of the Democratic and Republican parties, as the
increasing influence of values, education and gender are working in
overlapping ways to weaken the image of a working-class Democratic
Party battling a management and Wall Street-dominated GOP.
</P>
<P>
Candidates such as Thurman -- women who can win support from
Republican and independent voters concerned with such issues as health
care and abortion rights -- have become crucial to a Democratic Party
seeking to be competitive in an increasingly suburban and
college-educated electorate -- voters who have been most comfortable
with the GOP.
</P>
<P>
One of the most important growth areas within the Democratic Party
is among young, single working women with college educations.
</P>
<P>
Conversely, Garlits, whose parents were poor farmers, is part of a
modest but significant movement in the GOP, a movement that has
produced ``bubba Republicans'' in the South, and statewide candidates
in the North with roots in Catholic, working-class and immigrant
families -- the classic Democratic profile.
</P>
<P>
The Republican gubernatorial and Senate nominees picked last month
by primary voters in Pennsylvania are, respectively, Reps. Thomas J.
Ridge, an Irish-Slovak with working-class roots in Erie, and Rick
Santorum, the son of an Italian immigrant who represents a Pittsburg
district. Reps. Rod Grams of Minnesota and Ronald K. Machtley of Rhode
Island have good chances to win the GOP nominations for senator and
governor, respectively, and both earned their political spurs by
winning in Democratic-leaning blue-collar and working-class districts.
</P>
<P>
Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., chairman, Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee, said he views the loss of some traditional
Democratic voters as ``a naturally occurring phenomena.
</P>
<P>
``We are the party that is nominating people who are compatible''
with the suburban, well-educated voter, Fazio said, adding that
Democratic victories in suburban areas may be the counterpart to the
Republican victories of the 1980s among blue-collar ``Reagan
Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
One of the most important developments driving the transformation
of the parties by gender and education is the emergence of what might
be best described as liberal and conservative value coalitions of
voters. The partisan inclinations and demographic make-up of these
Republican and Democratic voters runs directly counter to the classic
divisions of the New Deal era.
</P>
<P>
Voters in the 1992 election holding decidedly ``liberal'' views on
abortion and gay rights were very well-educated, young and female -- 52
percent with college degrees, only 23 percent over age 50 and 68
percent women -- according to a study by Alan I. Abramowitz of Emory
University. The firmly ``conservative'' voters on these issues were
less well-educated and older -- 24 percent with college degrees, 48
percent age 50 or older -- and 57 percent were men.
</P>
<P>
Among some groups, such as young, single college-educated voters,
the partisan gulf between the sexes has reached such high levels
``that we (pollsters) joke among ourselves about how these people are
going to have trouble finding compatible spouses,'' said Democrat
Celinda Lake.
</P>
<P>
``Clinton has definitely polarized the gender gap,'' said
Republican pollster Linda DiVall. Younger women, she said, are more
Democratic in part because they ``tend to be employed in government
social service, education, and look to a more activist government.''
</P>
<P>
Greenberg said that female Democratic candidates are important not
only in their ability to win in more upscale, suburban districts but
also because ``they are seen as new, as outsiders ... not part of the
old-boy system. They reinforce the image of the Democratic Party as
new and reformist, and they also emphasize some of the secular side of
the Democratic Party,'' strengthing the perception of the party as
supporting abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
Female candidates in competitive congressional districts were able
to go ``beyond what normal Democrats can do,'' because women are seen
in many cases as representing ``change for the current system,'' said
freshman Rep. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, female candidates were involved in disproportionately high
numbers in the closest contests in the nation, and this year they are
disproportionately facing tough re-election fights against
well-financed opponents.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Thurman, the women the Democratic Party depended
upon in many middle-to-upscale, generally suburban districts, include
Reps. Elizabeth Furse (Ore.), Jane Harman (Calif.), Marjorie
Margolies-Mezvinsky (Pa.), Carolyn B. Maloney (N.Y.), Leslie L. Byrne
(Va.), Lynn Schenk (Calif.) and Cantwell.
</P>
<P>
While women are only 11 percent of the House membership, they make
up virtually half of the winners in the closest races won by House
Democrats in 1992.

   Here is an early look at the stories the Los Angeles Times is
considering for its first-edition Page 1 for Saturday:

   RUSSIA-TIMES -- VLADIVOSTOK, Russia -- Solemn and prophetic,
Alexander I. Solzhenitsyn ends his 20-year exile in the United States
with an appeal to people across Russia to direct their troubled
country's post-Communist rebirth by seizing more initiative from their
rulers in Moscow. Even though the country's greatest living author has
forsworn any ambition to elective or appointed office, his voice could
become a rallying cry for regional and local leaders seeking to wrest
more autonomy from the central government of President Boris N.
Yeltsin. By Richard Boudreaux.

   CHINA-ASSESS -- BEIJING -- In the end, China's success in overcoming
human rights opposition to win renewal of trade privileges from the
United States boils down to one simple truth: The Chinese regime
demonstrated a much better understanding of the American political
system than the Clinton administration did of the Chinese system. The
key to the Chinese strategy was to divert attention from human rights
issues to the blinding lights of China's booming economy and huge
potential market. By Rone Tempest.

   TICKETS -- LOS ANGELES -- The U.S. Justice Department has begun an
antitrust investigation of Los Angeles-based Ticketmaster after a top
rock band accused the giant ticket agency of organizing a boycott by
promoters of a low-cost concert tour. The probe began after lawyers
for the Seattle rock group Pearl Jam complained on May 6 to the
department's antitrust division in Washington. The band accused
Ticketmaster, the world's largest ticket agency, of exercising a
monopoly over ticket distribution and using that influence to keep
promoters from booking Pearl Jam's tour this summer. By Chuck Philips.

   SPEAK -- LONG BEACH, Calif. -- They wanted a role model, a teacher, a
motivator of young people to issue the final challenge to the Class of
'94. So administrators at Long Beach State's College of the Arts were
gleeful when this year's commencement speaker took the podium, an
unlikely sight in black academic robes and mortar board: Tommy
Lasorda. In what may have been the only graduation exercise covered by
ESPN, the Dodgers manager and diet-drink pitchman told the crowd of
aspiring Pacinos, Baryshnikovs and Van Cliburns what it takes for them
to succeed in life. Lasorda's appearance shows how far colleges will
go to entertain and inspire their charges before sending them off into
the cruel world. The reason: With more than 3,500 schools all looking
for keynote speakers at the same time of the year, the competition
means administrators must stalk eye-catching names for months, put the
grip on through influential alums or else settle for muffled
disappointment. By Ralph Frammolino.

 Sharon Announces Campaign to Oust Rabin in '96 (Jerusalem) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ariel Sharon, Israel's hawkish former defense minister,
launched a campaign Friday to oust Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in the
1996 elections, declaring his intention to form a broad right-wing
coalition and lead ``a rescue mission to save the Land of Israel and
the Jewish people.''
</P>
<P>
But Sharon's announcement was more a challenge to Benjamin
Netanyahu, chairman of the opposition Likud Party, who has been
feuding with Sharon.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu angrily demanded Sharon's expulsion from the party.
``Arik Sharon is a permanent subversive,'' he said. ``The time has
come for such a man to leave Likud.''
</P>
<P>
Sharon laughed off Netanyahu's demand, replying, ``I hope Mr.
Netanyahu will at least permit me to stay in the country.''
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, defeated by Rabin two years
ago, tartly rebuked Sharon, saying he ``should find more useful things
to do in the national interest than undermine it.''
</P>
<P>
Ze'ev ``Benny'' Begin, son of the late Prime Minister Menachem
Begin and a longtime Sharon foe, said that the burly former general is
as likely to win the premiership as he is the world tennis
championship.
</P>
<P>
And some members of Rabin's Labor Party, noting the deep divisions
in Israel's right wing -- Tsomet Party leader Rafael Eitan has also
declared his candidacy -- wondered aloud whether the prime minister
might not benefit by calling early national elections.
</P>
<P>
An opinion survey last week for the newspaper Yediot Aharonot
showed Rabin to be Israelis' preferred leader, winning support from 36
percent of those questioned. Netanyahu followed with 19 percent,
Sharon with 12 percent and Eitan with 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has maintained that if the right unites it could defeat
Labor, oust Rabin and return to the Likud's concept of Palestinian
autonomy on the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip under Israeli
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
``Sharon undermined both Begin and Shamir, and now he is
undermining me,'' Netanyahu said. ``He spreads the seeds of a split.''
</P>
<P>
Under a change in Israel's political system, the next prime
minister will be elected directly by popular vote and must win 50
percent of the vote, on a second ballot if not the first; in the past,
the party that won the most seats in Parliament nominated the prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
Sharon, 66, a retired general, is a fierce opponent of the
government's peace talks with the Palestinians and believes that any
withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza Strip will endanger Israel's
security and even its existence.

 China Welcomes Clinton's Renewal of Favorable Trade Status (Beijing) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chinese officials reacted with restrained satisfaction
Friday to President Clinton's announcement that the United States will
renew its favorable trade terms with China -- and, more importantly,
``delink'' trade with human rights issues.
</P>
<P>
``This decision will create favorable conditions for the further
strengthening and expansion of trade and economic cooperation between
the two sides. ...'' government spokesman Wu Jianmin announced at a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
``The Chinese government and people welcome this decision of
President Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
China had sought the removal of human rights conditions during a
year of hard lobbying and diplomatic efforts.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a subdued Clinton granted the Chinese precisely what
they wanted: the restoration of most-favored-nation, or MFN, trade
status and the reversal of a U.S. policy linking MFN to human rights -- 
a policy that has haunted Sino-American relations for the past five
years.
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese held back from overt celebration over the
diplomatic victory because Clinton also ordered a ban on the
$100-million-a-year import of weapons and ammunition, and kept in
effect some sanctions established by the Bush administration after the
army crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989.
</P>
<P>
In what amounted to the only joke of the day, spokesman Wu said
that he heard about Clinton's decision by listening to the Voice of
America. One of the conditions set by the Clinton administration was
that the Chinese stop jamming VOA broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing, American residents and business
people, many of whom fought strenuously for renewal of MFN, lauded
Clinton's decision.
</P>
<P>
Phil Carmichael, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in
Beijing, said at a news conference that he was relieved that he would
now have more time to spend on his business.
</P>
<P>
``It means I won't have to spend one-third to one-half of my time
each year trying to get MFN renewed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Other Asian governments also welcomed Clinton's action.
</P>
<P>
``From the start, we had maintained that there should be no
connection between trade and human rights issues,'' Malaysia's deputy
prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said renewal of China's
trading benefits was very important for the economic development of
the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
But some observers said Clinton's about-face could have a severe
impact on American prestige.
</P>
<P>
``You could call it the Clinton administration's declaration of
defeat,'' wrote Koji Igarashi, Washington correspondent for the
influential Asahi newspaper, in its evening edition Friday.
</P>
<P>
``It is a 180-degree change in direction from policy up until now,
and leaves the strong impression that (Clinton) gave in completely to
China's demands.''

 Tiananmen Square Anniversary Finds Canada in a Quandary (Toronto) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The five-year anniversary of China's Tiananmen Square
massacre finds Canada in a quandary.
</P>
<P>
The federal government is trying to figure out what to do with a
residue of Tiananmen: 4,500 Chinese who sought asylum here after the
uprising but were denied status as refugees. They have held on here
for nearly five years, and now the government has said it will decide
their fate next month.
</P>
<P>
They remain because Ottawa has an official policy of not deporting
anyone but criminals back to China -- the only country for which Canada
has such a policy. But Immigration Minister Sergio Marchi has said
that limbo must end.
</P>
<P>
Lin Xiaoping awaits the coming decision with trepidation. She left
Shanghai in March 1990, after police questioned her for carrying
videotapes of the uprising. She arrived in Canada via Bolivia. Today,
she is the proprietor of a restaurant in one of multiethnic Toronto's
five Chinatowns.
</P>
<P>
Lin's application for refugee status was denied, she said, because
officials did not believe her. She says her role here as president of
the Mainland Chinese Refugees Organization would single her out were
she forced to return to China.
</P>
<P>
``I hope the Canadian government will let me stay on compassionate
grounds,'' said Lin, 46. ``I was not directly involved (in the
Tiananmen uprising), but I did show my sympathy and agreement with the
students. Here, I fight for (the refugees') interests and benefits. My
activities here might be something the Chinese government would not be
happy with.''
</P>
<P>
The debate over the refugees comes at an important time in
Canadian-Chinese relations. Prime Minister Jean Chretien is to travel
to China this fall to promote trade.
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 Chinese immigrants are admitted to Canada every
year. Most come from Hong Kong or Taiwan, but some 30,000 mainland
Chinese have gained resident status here since January 1990.
</P>
<P>
Until recently, Canada was known as a relatively easy country in
which to gain refugee designation. The first wave of post-Tiananmen
refugees -- some of whom were already here as students -- overwhelmingly
had their applications to stay accepted, refugee lawyers say. But
later arrivals had a harder time persuading adjudicators they were not
merely seekers of economic opportunity.
</P>
<P>
``I think they are real refugees by (Geneva) convention criteria,''
said Schiller Wang, a reporter for the Toronto-based Chinese-language
newspaper World Journal Daily News. ``It's a big problem from a
cultural standpoint. Some Chinese refugee claimants don't understand
the question the judge is asking, and the interpreter is not allowed
to explain.''
</P>
<P>
Some of the rejected refugees have held off buying houses or
establishing roots, waiting until their status becomes clearer.
Although they are considered legal residents, their conditional status
makes it difficult to find legitimate jobs or enroll in welfare
programs. Even those with capital are reluctant to start businesses
for fear they may have to sell quickly.
</P>
<P>
``It's killing for them because they are go-getters,'' said
Montreal refugee lawyer Richard Kurland. ``I've had grown men and
women crying in my office because they are so frustrated. They can't
go back because they'd go right to jail, but they can't get permanent
status here.''
</P>
<P>
Marchi has ruled out a blanket amnesty for the affected Chinese,
although he may propose establishing a special process by which they
could apply for legal-immigrant status. They would have to show, for
instance, that they can function in Canada's economy rather than
living on its broad social assistance.
</P>
<P>
Even within the Chinese community, some admit that not all who seek
to remain here are true refugees. But there is general agreement that
their future should be settled one way or another.
</P>
<P>
``If the government thinks they are not refugees, send them back.
If the government thinks that would be inhuman, let them stay,'' said
Tian Guang, general adviser to the refugees' organization. ``You
cannot keep people in limbo for four or five years. These people have
been exhausted, physically, psychologically and emotionally.''

 Solzhenitsyn Returns to a Divided Russia (Vladivostok) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
VLADIVOSTOK, Russia
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Solemn and prophetic, Alexander I.
Solzhenitsyn ended his 20-year exile Friday with an appeal to people
across Russia to seize the initiative in directing their troubled
country's post-Communist rebirth.
</P>
<P>
``I know that I am coming to a Russia torn apart, discouraged,
stunned, altered beyond recognition, convulsively searching for
itself, for its true identity,'' the country's greatest living author
told an evening homecoming rally in this Pacific port city, his
starting point for a Trans-Siberian rail journey to rediscover his
country and compatriots.
</P>
<P>
``I would like, after these meetings, to help you and search
together with you for sure ways to get out of our 75-year quagmire,''
added Solzhenitsyn, who exposed his Soviet tormentors with powerful
writings that earned him the Nobel Prize -- and expulsion from his
homeland on Feb. 14, 1974.
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 people waited three hours on a gray, blustery evening
in a seaside plaza for his dramatic return on an Air Alaska commercial
flight from the United States. They applauded when his brief speech
ended with the words, ``I bow to you.''
</P>
<P>
``We bow to you!'' someone shouted.
</P>
<P>
Then, answering a question from the audience, he said that Russia's
revival after seven decades of Soviet rule and two years of
tumultuous, divisive and stalled democratic reforms would be
``difficult, not soon'' and would ultimately depend on Russians taking
responsibility for their own fate.
</P>
<P>
Judging from his remarks and his ambitious travel plans, the
bearded, craggy-faced author intends, at age 75, to play a guiding
role in Russian life, although he has forsworn seeking elective or
appointed office. His voice could provide a rallying cry for regional
and local leaders seeking to wrest more autonomy from the central
government of President Boris N. Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Russia's Itar-Tass news agency, Solzhenitsyn
was more categorical about his mission and blunter in his criticism of
Moscow, which he said ``is leading a privileged life compared with the
provinces.'' He said he was returning home east to west because ``to
begin with Moscow means to lock oneself in a concrete box.''
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
``My literary task is fulfilled,'' he added. ``Now I will have no
time to write. It's time to get down to the hard work of rebuilding
and reviving Russia.''
</P>
<P>
Many who turned out to see Solzhenitsyn, like Galina N. Petrovna,
said they are ready to follow his prescriptions as those of a sage.
</P>
<P>
Petrovna, a graying, bright-eyed woman of 69, came to the square
bedecked with Soviet medals earned for underground resistance in a
Nazi prison camp. But she was a reluctant hero, having lost her father
in the Stalin regime's political executions.
</P>
<P>
``I have been waiting for this moment all my life,'' she said at
the rally for Solzhenitsyn. ``Here is a great man who can show us how
to rebuild our country. If we had worked like he does, by the call of
our souls and hearts, we would live now in a different, much happier
country.''
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
The trip began Wednesday in an Oldsmobile station wagon, lumbering
down the unpaved driveway from the hilltop country home in Cavendish,
Vt., where Solzhenitsyn spent the past 18 years writing in
near-seclusion.
</P>
<P>
With a newly issued Russian passport, the author flew to Anchorage,
Alaska, with his wife, Natalia, and Stephan, 20, the youngest of their
three sons. They left behind the middle son, Ignat, 21, and Natalia's
mother, Yekaterina Svetlova, who will join them later. The eldest son,
Yermolai, 23, flew here, 5,700 miles from Moscow, ahead of his parents
to help arrange the overland journey to the capital, which he called
``the greatest road trip you could do.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Air Alaska's first touchdown in Russia came at Magadan, once a main
receiving point for those destined for the Soviet gulag prison camp
system. Solzhenitsyn, who spent eight years in the gulag and exposed
its evils in his best-known works, once described Magadan as the site
of the most human bones on earth.
</P>
<P>
Stepping off the jet, Solzhenitsyn stooped, touched the tarmac with
both hands and crossed himself.
</P>
<P>
``Today, in the heat of political change, those millions of victims
are too lightly forgotten, both by those who were not touched by that
annihilation and even more so by those who were responsible for it,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
``Under ancient Christian tradition, land where innocent victims
are buried becomes holy. We shall consider it so, in the hope that the
light of Russia's coming recovery will reach (this) region.''
</P>
<P>
Landing in Vladivostok, he accepted an offering of bread and salt -- 
a Russian symbol of hospitality -- and raised the loaf to his lips.
</P>
<P>
``All the best people are leaving Russia, and Solzhenitsyn is the
one coming back,'' said Antonina N. Detyareva, 39, who was selling
dried squid and imported apples just off the puddled airport parking
lot. ``Maybe that will set a good example.''
</P>
<P>
The writer returned a controversial figure, however, scorned by
many who miss the old order and condemn him for helping destroy it.
``He'll get no warm welcome from me,'' said Vladimir A. Gornoslal, 45,
a taxi driver at the airport. ``I don't like traitors.''

 Sharon Plans to Run for Prime Minister (Jerusalem) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ariel Sharon, the right-wing former general who led
Israel into the war with Lebanon in 1982, announced Friday that he
intends to run for prime minister in the next election, further
dividing the once powerful Likud opposition party.
</P>
<P>
Sharon's announcement was a blow to Likud leader Binyamin
Netanyahu, who was elected head of the party last year and also hopes
to run for prime minister. Netanyahu has failed to quell challenges
from his rivals, and Friday he denounced Sharon, demanding that he be
thrown out of the party.
</P>
<P>
The next election, in two years, is to be the first in Israel's
history in which the prime minister will be chosen by direct popular
vote. In the past, voters chose party lists, and the parties then
jockeyed for coalitions and a parliamentary majority to control the
government.
</P>
<P>
The new system seems certain to reward candidates who run outside
their parties' establishment, and there are signs both Likud and the
ruling Labor Party face the prospect of divisions and possible
breakup.
</P>
<P>
Another factor fragmenting the old parties is the accord with the
Palestine Liberation Organization on self-rule in the Gaza Strip and
West Bank. Some analysts think if the pact holds and the issue of
those territories is removed from atop the national agenda, new
political blocs will spring up, based on issues other than security.
</P>
<P>
For example, Labor recently lost control of the giant Histadrut
labor federation for the first time in its history. In a race for the
federation's leadership, the winner was a youthful Labor politician,
Haim Ramon, who broke away from the party establishment and ran
against Labor's candidate on a platform of domestic issues, chiefly
better health care.
</P>
<P>
Sharon, however, remains a stalwart of the old order, and his
challenge is clearly based on a hawkish, nationalist ideology. He has
been among the sharpest critics of the Israeli-PLO accord and has
gained a following among hard-line Jewish settlers in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Sharon, 66, has never concealed his disdain for Netanyahu, and his
declaration Friday set off fireworks. ``Arik Sharon is a permanent
subversive,'' Netanyahu told Army Radio. ``The time has come for such
a man to leave Likud.''
</P>
<P>
``That Arik Sharon wants to be prime minister -- at a minimum, prime
minister -- is no surprise,'' said Netanyahu, using Sharon's nickname.
</P>
<P>
Sharon snapped back, ``I hope Mr. Netanyahu will at least permit me
to stay in the country.''
</P>
<P>
Polls show that Labor Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin would be the
first choice of Israeli Jews if an election were held now. A survey
last week published by the daily Yedioth Aharonoth showed 36 percent
of those questioned choose Rabin, followed by 19 percent for
Netanyahu, 12 percent for Sharon and 11 percent for Rafael Eitan,
another former general who heads the nationalist Tsomet Party and has
announced plans to run for prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The feuding in the opposition has been intense since the 1992
election in which Labor and Rabin defeated Likud and Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir.
</P>
<P>
Binyamin Begin, a supporter of Netanyahu, said Friday that the
garrulous Sharon had about as much chance of becoming prime minister
as he did of winning a world tennis championship. Moshe Katsav, leader
of the Likud forces in parliament, rejected Netanyahu's suggestion
that Sharon be ousted and called instead for a collective leadership.
Shamir urged Sharon to find something else to do.
</P>
<P>
Also, former Foreign Minister David Levy, angered by what he
considered a smear campaign against him by Netanyahu, has boycotted
all Likud Party gatherings in recent months.

 Congress Asked to Delay Sessions with Ames (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The House and Senate intelligence committees have been
asked by Justice Department officials to delay their possible
questioning of confessed-spy Aldrich H. Ames until the FBI and CIA
have finished debriefing him, according to administration and
congressional sources.
</P>
<P>
The officials have argued that interrupting the interrogation of
Ames for Capitol Hill appearances could have a harmful effect on what
investigators hope to learn from the veteran, 52-year-old former CIA
counterintelligence officer.
</P>
<P>
``In the complex process of establishing rapport and a questioning
pattern with an individual such as Ames, you don't want to introduce
other influences,'' one source said.
</P>
<P>
The House panel has agreed to wait, according to a spokesman for
committee chairman Dan Glickman, D-Kan. The spokesman added that even
before the Justice Department made its appeal, the panel had not
contemplated asking Ames to appear until after the government had
concluded its questioning and the committee staff reviewed the
results.
</P>
<P>
Glickman wrote to Ames's lawyer, Plato Cacheris, on May 5 asking
that his client testify in closed session about ``his perspective on
counterintelligence issues.'' No date for an appearance was mentioned
in the letter.
</P>
<P>
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz., also has informally sounded out Cacheris about an Ames
appearance but has yet to raise the matter with other committee
members. A Senate committee aide said there had been conversations
with the Justice Department about Ames but nothing has been decided.
Meanwhile, he said, committee members were disturbed by reports from
television reporters that Ames has been discussing possibly appearing
on television.
</P>
<P>
``Senators have been asking Justice, `How come you are permitting
this and blocking us?' '' the aide said.
</P>
<P>
Although representatives from three major television networks have
either called or sent letters to Ames's attorney asking about
interviews, Cacheris said yesterday, ``Mr. Ames is not going to do any
interviews until after his wife is sentenced.''
</P>
<P>
Rosario Ames, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit espionage
and income tax evasion, is scheduled to be sentenced Aug. 26. The
length of her prison term, which could be as short as five years or as
long as 15 years, is dependent on her husband's cooperation with FBI
and CIA interrogators under the guilty plea agreements they both
signed in April.
</P>
<P>
Aldrich Ames faces a life term in prison with no provision for
parole for his nine years of spying for Moscow. In return for $2.5
million and the promise of at least $1.9 million more, Ames delivered
highly sensitive intelligence information including the names of at
least 11 communist intelligence agents who were passing information to
the United States or Britain.
</P>
<P>
CIA officials are bitter at the thought that the congressional
committees may turn for advice on how the CIA should be run to a man
who betrayed his country and his colleagues. ``That presses some hot
buttons out here,'' a senior CIA official said.
</P>
<P>
Former CIA director Richard M. Helms summed up the view of several
other retired agency officials, saying that ``having a traitor on the
Hill to vent his spleen is a dangerous precedent ... and I deplore
it.''
</P>
<P>
CIA Director R. James Woolsey told an interviewer earlier this
month that ``one of the strangest things about the Ames case is the
fact that some people would take seriously Ames as an authority on the
CIA and what its value is.''
</P>
<P>
Rep. Larry Combest of Texas, the ranking Republican on the House
intelligence panel, gave the rationale for hearing from Ames. It
``would be intriguing to have him and hear how he did it,'' Combest
said. Ames ``has a perspective of the agency that is rather unique.''
</P>
<P>
Ames said recently that he would ``look forward'' to testifying. In
a statement in court the day he was sentenced, Ames described
espionage ``as carried out by the CIA and a few other American
agencies'' as ``a self-serving sham.''

 Defending French Culture From Invading Americans (Paris) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Jacques Chirac led the Gaullist conservatives to an
overwhelming victory in national elections last year, he had his eye
on a bigger prize -- the presidency. Unfortunately, the sitting
president, Francois Mitterrand, planned to keep the job until his term
expired in 1995.
</P>
<P>
So the conservatives devised a cunning, though politically risky
strategy. They selected Edouard Balladur, one of Chirac's oldest
friends, a modest man without presidential aspirations or thundering
charisma, to take the job of prime minister, the nation's
second-most-powerful job. That way, they figured, Chirac would be free
to run for president while the mild-mannered Balladur, a seasoned
politician, attempted to ``cohabit'' with Mitterrand and grapple with
the domestic problems.
</P>
<P>
But Balladur has, in just a year on the job, become the odds-on
favorite to replace Mitterrand, a Socialist, in the country's highest
office.
</P>
<P>
The 65-year-old prime minister's popularity has baffled political
analysts, journalists and even his own colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say Balladur's popularity stems, in part, from his
relative anonymity. Although a career government official, whose jobs
included chief of staff to President Georges Pompidou in the 1970s,
Balladur was not well known to most voters. And many in France were
looking for a fresh face.
</P>
<P>
Balladur is known for his formality and his courtesy.
</P>
<P>
As he sat for a rare interview at Matignon, the prime minister's
office on the Left Bank of Paris, he wore a tailored, Saville Row suit
and kept the jacket buttoned.
</P>
<P>
Born in Turkey to a well-to-do French banker, Balladur earned a
degree from the Ecole Nationale d'Administration, the school of
France's bureaucratic elite. He understands English, but prefers to
speak in French. ``I have a complex with English,'' he explained. ``I
don't like to appear ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
Though an unabashed protector of things French, the prime minister
is fond of the United States and Americans. Under his guidance, the
government is spending millions of dollars this year on D-Day landing
ceremonies. And, at the government's invitation, President Clinton
will become only the second foreigner in decades to address Parliament
next month. 
</P>
<P>
Question: Many Americans
</P>
<P>
are beginning to believe that France wants to close its cultural
doors to competition. What's your feeling?
</P>
<P>
Answer: Yes. Yesterday, Ted Turner was in this office and we talked
about that. I think there is one thing that must be understood: We are
strongly against a uniform world culture with one single world
language.
</P>
<P>
We the French consider that we have a great culture and a great
civilization language and that it's perfectly legitimate that we
should defend our culture. I forget what the exact percentages are,
but American films have much more than 50 percent of the French
market. And French films in the United States are just a few
percentage points. So I think really the question is for me to put to
you.
</P>
<P>
Q: The question is, though, can you protect it by legislation, by
law?
</P>
<P>
A: I think one can, yes. And it's our firm intention to do so.
</P>
<P>
Now, this brings up a problem. It's really a problem of principle.
Should world progress only spring from the law of the markets? And
that applies to everything. Economy, trade, culture. If that is the
case, then nations are no longer of any use. We could just ``leave it
to nature,`` so to speak.
</P>
<P>
As you know, the tendency of nature is that the strongest become
stronger, and the weakest become weaker. The basis of civilizations is
their struggle against nature. That is the basis of education, of
religion, of democracy, of law.
</P>
<P>
So, it is a civilization endeavor that we are engaged in. It's a
bit of a paradox.
</P>
<P>
Q: What baffles many Americans is why France, such a powerful
country and with such a rich culture, needs laws to protect its
culture and its language. The French didn't need to protect their
culture in the 19th Century.
</P>
<P>
A: There are two different aspects. First is the language and,
secondly, there is what you might call the cultural industry.
</P>
<P>
As for the language itself, this is not something new we are doing.
Three and a half centuries ago, the Academie Francaise was set up (to
protect the language). It's not something my government has thought up
that is new.
</P>
<P>
One has to have an open mind on this. Words like le weekend are
part of the French language now. The only thing is, you shouldn't
overdo this. When the precise French word exists, there's no point in
not using it.
</P>
<P>
Q: And culture?
</P>
<P>
A: What is more interesting, really, is the cultural industry, the
cultural economy, if you like. You're perfectly right. In the 19th
century, this wasn't necessary, nor at the beginning of the 20th
century. But cultural activity has become a very big consumer product.
It's true of books, films, shows. It needs a market to live.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
And a country whose territory isn't big enough needs to help those
cultural activities, to give them what the market cannot provide. It's
a problem you don't have in the United States, because the market is
already there. You have almost 300 million consumers of cultural
products.
</P>
<P>
But it is a problem in Europe, and especially in European countries
that don't use English as a national language.
</P>
<P>
The inadequacy of the market has caused a certain number of film
industries to almost completely disappear in Europe. Luckily, the
French film industry still exists, but I think it exists only thanks
to this machinery that we have. And that's why you have to correct
market forces.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
If we had a Francophone market with 300 million people, then we
wouldn't need to have this machinery. But your products and your
cultural activities already pay for themselves in the U.S. market,
and, therefore, they can be exported at a very low cost. We can't do
that.
</P>
<P>
So I think it's a consequence of the fact that France is smaller
than the United States, both in geographical terms and in population.
</P>
<P>
Q: Clint Eastwood was recently honored by the French culture
minister for his work in films. That kind of thing is confusing to
many Americans. The French seem to like Hollywood films, but the
government seems to not want them to like those films.
</P>
<P>
A: That's not at all it. First of all, Clint Eastwood wouldn't have
had his declaraton if the government hadn't agreed. But you need both.
We like American films. I'm very fond of American films and American
actors and actresses. There are some very fine actors. But it doesn't
mean that they should be the only ones on the screens. They have a
monopoly.
</P>
<P>
We also were a very powerful country in the past, and our tendency
at the time, probably, was also to consider that French language and
French culture excluded all others. Now history has moved. Things have
changed. And things will go on changing. One day you (Americans) may
have to defend yourself against Chinese films.
</P>
<P>
Q: Speaking of that reduction in French power. Is it difficult for
the French to accept a lesser role in world affairs?
</P>
<P>
A: I think the French people have gotten used to this for a number
of years. But at the same time, I think at the heart of every
Frenchman there is a feeling that his civilization has a worldwide
value. It's a heritage we get from the French Revolution.
</P>
<P>
At the heart of all French men and women is the feeling, perhaps,
that they embody an international value, related to principles, to
rules, to laws, to behavior.
</P>
<P>
If you look at our colonial past, it essentially consisted of
seeing to it that the largest possible number of populations were able
to join the French model of civilization.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
There are two ways of looking at that phenomenon. You can say that
it was generosity, if you like. But you can also say it was a sort of
imperialism. You can say both and there probably is a bit of truth in
both, anyway.
</P>
<P>
So, basically, France considers that she has a special mission in
the service of peace and human rights. That doesn't mean she always
fulfills that mission in a proper way, but she tries to do it.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Q: A few months ago, President Clinton suggested that America
should try to strengthen its economic ties with Asia rather than focus
only on Europe. Does that worry you?
</P>
<P>
A: I do not share your analysis. If he shows a bigger overture to
Asia, such an evolution seems to me to be natural. It's the same for
us. We are more interested in Asia than 10 years ago. It should not be
interpreted as U.S. disinterest in Europe.
</P>
<P>
We often forget in Europe that a seashore of your country is turned
toward the Pacific, and that your interest in Asia is ancient and
constant. But it does not constitute an alternative to the privileged
relations that have to go on between the two seashores of the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
Q: How are relations between France and the United States at the
moment?
</P>
<P>
A: I am satisfied by the state of Franco-American relations now,
and optimistic about their future. France and the United States base
their relations on identical, fundamental interests. We have always
found solutions to our temporary problems without affecting the
privileged character of our alliance, which has seen our countries
side by side in major crises.
</P>
<P>
This was true in the time of Gen. (Charles) de Gaulle, during the
Cuban missile crisis, and it was even more true during the Gulf War.
The celebration of D-Day in Normandy next month will give us the
opportunity to again celebrate an important page of our common
history.

 Chiles Signs Bill Authorizing Florida to Sue Tobacco 
 Producers (Miami) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MIAMI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pledging to make cigarette manufacturers pay, Florida Gov.
Lawton Chiles (D) signed legislation this week that authorizes the
state to sue makers of tobacco producers for the billions the state
spent caring for sick smokers.
</P>
<P>
The controversial bill is being hailed by anti-smoking advocates as
the ultimate club to wield against tobacco companies, a ``smart bomb''
that allows the state to initiate a sweeping class-action suit to
recoup state Medicaid money spent on patients suffering from illnesses
associated with smoking.
</P>
<P>
``This law brings about the greatest change in the liability of the
tobacco companies in the last 50 years,'' said Matthew Myers, counsel
for the Coalition on Smoking or Health in Washington, which represents
the national heart, lung and cancer societies.
</P>
<P>
If Florida succeeds in defending its legislation -- in a special
session of the legislature June 7 and in the courts -- and then sues
the tobacco industry, other states will almost surely follow.
Mississippi, without the benefit of new legislation, this week sued
the tobacco industry to recoup its costs of treating smokers.
</P>
<P>
The tobacco industry vows to fight the legislation in a special
legislative session, which was called to deal with health care
reforms.
</P>
<P>
``We're viewing this has a very serious situation. ... They ought
to repeal it,'' said Brennan Dawson, spokesperson for the Tobacco
Institute in Washington. ``The bill says don't do business in the
state of Florida. You can't defend yourself.''
</P>
<P>
The tobacco industry has allies in Florida's strongest business
lobby, whose leaders warn that the new legislation exposes other
industries -- such as liquor -- to costly litigation. The legislation
does not single out tobacco, though that is the industry that Chiles
says the bill was designed to tackle.
</P>
<P>
``For decades now, tobacco companies have turned an enormous profit
 -- while their victims have turned to the taxpayers for treatment,''
Chiles said Thursday at the bill signing. ``It's time that those
responsible are made to pay.''
</P>
<P>
The bill is the brainchild of Harold Lewis, general counsel for
Florida's Agency for Health Care Administration. Lewis said he
designed the bill to take away the most powerful arguments the tobacco
industry has traditionally used to defend itself against lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
Under the legislation, cigarette manufacturers will no longer be
able to argue that smokers knew of risks, either from the surgeon
general's reports or from the warnings on cigarette packs -- because it
is the state that is suing, not the smokers.
</P>
<P>
``The state is the innocent victim,'' said Lewis. ``The state
didn't smoke the cigarettes. The state didn't read the warnings on the
cigarette packs ... But the state has to pay the bills.''
</P>
<P>
Chiles said that Florida taxpayers have spent at least $1.2 billion
in Medicaid payments over the last five years for smoke-related
illness, including lung cancer and emphysema.
</P>
<P>
Lewis also wrote the legislation in such a way that tobacco
manufacturers will no longer be able to argue that smoking did not
cause a specific illness in a specific person.
</P>
<P>
The new legislation enables Florida to rely on statistical evidence
that cigarettes caused sickness. The state will simply tally the
number of Medicaid patients who are treated for illnesses commonly
associated with smoking, and then seek compensation from the tobacco
companies for the state's health care costs.
</P>
<P>
The state need not even name plaintiffs, nor does it need to show
that those patients smoked one or another company's brands. If found
liable, the companies would simply be assigned shares of the blame
based on their shares on the cigarette market in Florida. Lewis said
the idea of litigating based on market share has been used in product
liability cases for breast implants and asbestos.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco industry advocates charge that the new legislation was
slipped through without any real understanding by legislators. The
bill passed as an amendment to a large Medicaid fraud bill and was
voted on without debate or hearings.
</P>
<P>
Lewis, however, contends the bill circulated for some 29 hours:
``That's an eternity'' in the Florida legislature, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jon Shebel, president of Associated Industries, the state's most
powerful business lobby, said Friday that Chiles has already signaled
that he would narrow the new legislation to target only tobacco
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Shebel went even further, suggesting that the bill might be
repealed if Chiles could get the tobacco industry to contribute money
to offset Florida's Medicaid costs.
</P>
<P>
``He wants them to put money into Medicaid system,'' Shebel said.
``That's really what the governor wants.''

 Cardinals Present English Version of New Catechism to Pope 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A delegation of cardinals Friday officially presented to Pope John
Paul II the English version of the new Catechism of the Catholic
Church, the first universal book of the church's teachings in 428
years.
</P>
<P>
Disagreements over references to men, women and the holy Trinity
had delayed publication for more than a year. The Vatican rejected
early drafts by the American translators and insisted on retaining
references to ``men'' rather than ``men and women'' or ``the human
race'' in referring to humanity.
</P>
<P>
The 803-page compendium of faith -- an outgrowth of the Vatican II
council of 1962 to 1965 -- is an all-purpose guide that reaffirms the
abiding principles of Roman Catholic doctrine and practice and applies
them to some of the most painful dilemmas of modern life.
</P>
<P>
It upholds the authority of the church hierarchy and restates the
church's strong prohibitions against premarital sex, abortion,
euthanasia and divorce. Its condemnation of homosexuality is tempered
by a call for ``respect, compassion and sensitivity'' toward gay
people and a rejection of ``unjust discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
The book condemns the arms race and states that employers who
neglect to pay adequate wages to their workers or engage in tax fraud
commit ``a grave injustice.'' And it states that Muslims and Jews are
among believers who are eligible for salvation -- a major shift from
the old, discredited catechism of the 16th Century Council of Trent.
</P>
<P>
The pope, who received the new catechism in the hospital room where
he is recovering from hip surgery, called the translation ``faithful''
to the French original he approved Dec. 8, 1992. He said in a
statement that the new text fulfills a need ``of millions of
English-speaking faithful ... seeking a full and balanced exposition
of the Catholic truth professed, celebrated, lived and prayed by the
Church throughout the world.''
</P>
<P>
The presenters included Cardinal Bernard F. Law, archbishop of
Boston, who introduced the idea of a new compendium of faith at an
international conference of bishops in 1985. The pope approved the
plan and appointed an oversight commission that included Law and
Archbishop William J. Levada, of Portland, Ore. The catechism was
translated last year into German, Spanish and Italian.
</P>
<P>
Although it will not be published officially until June 22, the new
text is already an instant bestseller among the nation's 59 million
Catholics. The first printing of more than 560,000 has sold out. A
second printing of at least 100,000 will begin June 13 for delivery in
July. The U.S. Catholic Conference Office of Publishing and Promotion
Services, which holds the American rights for the English text, has
signed on 15 other companies as co-publishers to ensure the widest
circulation possible.
</P>
<P>
Catholic leaders expressed delight that the English version is
finally available. ``There has not been a comparable Catholic
publishing event in this nation's history,'' said Baltimore Archbishop
William H. Keeler, president of the National Conference of Catholic
Bishops, in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
Monsignor William E. Lori, vicar general and chancellor of the
archdiocese of Washington, said the new catechism will be used as the
basis for religious instruction materials throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Critics expressed concern over the Vatican's decision to use
exclusively masculine terminology. ``I feel very badly about it,''
Bishop Joseph Imesch of Joliet, Ill., told the Associated Press. ``I
don't think Rome has any understanding about the feelings that are
aroused when you use exclusive language.''
</P>
<P>
But Archbishop Keeler called the issue ``a serious question ...
which only time and further study can answer.''
</P>
<P>
The last universal catechism was issued in 1566 after the Council
of Trent, convened to respond to the spread of the Protestant
Reformation. A condensed and updated version, the Baltimore Catechism,
was approved in 1885 by James Cardinal Gibbons, the Archbishop of
Baltimore. With the Second Vatican Council in the mid-1960s, this
version fell out of favor and was replaced by other religious
textbooks.
</P>
<P>
``Catechesis'' is rooted in the Greek verb katekhein, to resound or
echo. In the New Testament, it refers to oral instruction used to pass
down the teachings of Christ. Oral instruction continued until the
16th Century and the invention of the printing press.

 George Ball Dies at 84 (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George W. Ball, who was under secretary of state
during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations and one of the few
high-ranking U.S. officials to offer early and vigorous counsel
against U.S. involvement in the war in Vietnam, died of cancer May 26
at New York Hospital. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
Ball, who served in the State Department from 1961 to 1966, was a
specialist in foreign affairs, international law and commercial
relations for most of his adult life. In the Kennedy administration,
he was part of the task force that steered the U.S. through the Cuban
Missile Crisis, and he was an influential advocate of liberal world
trade policies and monetary stability while in government and out of
it.
</P>
<P>
During World War II, he worked on the Lend Lease program to supply
war materiel to the Allies. He later headed the U.S. Strategic Bombing
Survey, a civilian panel appointed by President Roosevelt to evaluate
the social, economic and physical effects of the air raids on Nazi
Germany. From this experience came Ball's conclusion that massive
bombing would be ineffectual in a country such as Vietnam, which
lacked a developed industrial infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
After World War II, he served as general counsel to the French
Supply Mission, which was engaged in the acquisition of supplies for
the economic rehabilitation of postwar France. In this role, he worked
closely with Jean Monnet, the architect of European economic unity,
and he became one of the foremost American disciples of Monnet's
vision. Later he was an adviser to Monnet during the preliminary work
that led to the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community and
later the European Common Market.
</P>
<P>
From May of 1968 until January of 1969, Ball was back in government
service as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. During the Carter
administration, he was an adviser on Iran and Persian Gulf policies.
At other times in his career, he had been a U.S. trouble-shooter in
such places as Zaire, Cyprus and Laos.
</P>
<P>
As a government official, Ball was said by associates to have been
a stickler for details and an extraordinarily hard worker who found
relaxing difficult. He wrote and rewrote all his own speeches, and he
was often a nuisance to his colleagues after hours and on weekends.
</P>
<P>
Away from the office, he was an amateur carpenter who spent years
working on an addition to his home in Washington.
</P>
<P>
A resident of Princeton, N.J., Ball was born in Des Moines. He
graduated from Northwestern University, where he also received a law
degree. He came to Washington directly from law school at the outset
of the New Deal, and he worked until 1935 in the office of the general
counsel of the Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
From 1935 until returning to Washington in 1942, he practiced law
in Chicago. He was appointed associate general counsel of the Lend
Lease Administration, and then held the same position with the Foreign
Economic Administration, of which Lend Lease had become a part.
</P>
<P>
As director of the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey, Ball interviewed
several high Nazi officials, including Albert Speer, the German
minister of armaments, munitions and production, whom he interrogated
for seven days with economist John Kenneth Galbraith. A report on this
interrogation was published in Life magazine in December of 1945.
</P>
<P>
In Washington after the war, Ball was a founding partner of the law
firm now known as Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen and Hamilton, with offices
in New York, Washington, Paris and Brussels. At his death he was of
counsel to the firm.
</P>
<P>
Politically he was active in the presidential campaigns of former
Illinois Gov. Adlai E. Stevenson, the Democratic nominee in 1952 and
1956. Ball had known Stevenson since his days as a young lawyer in
Chicago. He was director of Volunteers for Stevenson in 1952, and was
director of public relations for the Stevenson-Kefauver ticket in
1956..
</P>
<P>
In 1960, he backed Stevenson again for the Democratic presidential
nomination. But after Kennedy's election, a report by Ball and a
colleague on economic policy and the balance of payments caught the
new president's attention. He named Ball under secretary of state for
economic affairs, the third-ranking post in the State Department. Ball
was appointed under secretary of state, the second-ranking position,
in November of 1961.
</P>
<P>
That same month, Ball recalled in his 1982 Memoirs, ``The Past Has
Another Pattern,'' he warned Kennedy privately that it would be a
tragic blunder to commit U.S. troops to Vietnam. ``Within five years,
we'll have 300,000 men in the paddies and jungles and never find
them,'' Ball recalled saying.
</P>
<P>
He wrote that Kennedy answered him, ``You're just crazier than
hell. That just isn't going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
During the Johnson presidency, Ball was often called the ``Devil's
advocate,'' on Vietnam, but he maintained a close personal
relationship with Secretary of State Dean Rusk, a supporter of the
war. They often enjoyed a drink together at the end of the day, and
when Ball resigned in 1966, he left on good terms.
</P>
<P>
Ball then joined the investment banking firm of Lehman Brothers
Kuhn Loeb as a senior partner. He resigned in May of 1968 to become
United Nations ambassador, but he returned to the firm in 1969. He
retired in 1982 as senior managing director.
</P>
<P>
In addition to his memoirs, Ball was author of four other books,
including ``The Discipline of Power,'' published in 1968. In it he
wrote, ``Today, America is in an ugly mood. By a series of small
steps, taken in good faith over a period of years, we have mired
ourselves in a frustrating war that turns our otherwise sensible
countrymen into placard-carrying hysterics. Already we hear the
querulous frog croaks of an old isolationism.''
</P>
<P>
Ball's other books include ``Diplomacy for a Crowded World''
(1976), ``Error and Betrayal in Lebanon'' (1984) and ``The Passionate
Attachment: America's Involvement with Israel, 1947 to the Present''
(1992).
</P>
<P>
He was a recipient of the Medal of Freedom, the highest U.S.
civilian award.
</P>
<P>
His wife of 50 years, Ruth M. Ball, died in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Survivors include two sons, John C. Ball of Concord, Mass., and
Douglas B. Ball of Rockville Centre, N.Y.; and two grandchildren.

 Disagreement Over PAC Limits Jeopardizes Campaign Financing 
 Legislation (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Swift passage of long-promised legislation to overhaul
congressional campaign financing laws has been jeopardized because the
House and Senate remain sharply divided over limits on contributions
from political action committees (PACs), the chief sponsor of the
Senate bill warned.
</P>
<P>
``I would say the fate of campaign finance hangs in the balance ...
the chances of enactment are now only about 50-50,'' Sen. David L.
Boren, D-Okla., said in an interview Thursday after the latest in a
series of inconclusive meetings on the issue between House and Senate
Democratic leaders.
</P>
<P>
Boren's assessment was made as Congress slowed its earlier fast
pace of action, sending lawmakers home for their 10-day Memorial Day
recess without final action on any of the major bills that
congressional leaders hoped to send to President Clinton before the
holiday.
</P>
<P>
Two of these measures -- a big anti-crime bill and legislation to
tighten controls on lobbyists and restrict or ban gifts to lawmakers -- 
are headed for House-Senate conferences when Congress returns June 7,
facing what negotiators describe as difficult but not insurmountable
obstacles.
</P>
<P>
But the campaign finance bill, which passed the Senate nearly a
year ago and the House last November, is stuck in pre-conference talks
between the top leaders of both chambers, with increasingly impatient
Republicans grumbling from the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
Just six weeks ago, congressional leaders appeared optimistic about
a speedy completion of the nearly decade-long struggle to pass the
first comprehensive bill to tighten campaign finance rules since the
post-Watergate reforms of 1974.
</P>
<P>
Both House and Senate bills would set voluntary spending ceilings
for congressional candidates, provide incentives for compliance and
tighten controls over special-interest spending. Even the sensitive
issue of how to fund public subsidies for candidates without dipping
into general tax revenues -- considered a taboo in the current
political climate -- is in the final stages of being worked out by
House leaders.
</P>
<P>
But there has been little if any movement on the key issue: what
limits to put on contributions that can be made to any single campaign
by PACs, which are created by corporations, unions and other interest
groups to influence legislation by raising funds for candidates.
</P>
<P>
In its original bill, the House voted to retain the current $5,000
limit. The Senate voted to ban PACs or, failing that, to reduce the
limit to $1,000. Senators have suggested compromising at $2,500, but
House leaders are resisting any change.
</P>
<P>
House Democrats believe they risk crippling Democratic defections
if PAC limits are reduced too far, but Senate Democrats cannot break a
GOP filibuster without help from a half-dozen Republicans who are
insisting on the lowest possible PAC limits for all congressional
races.
</P>
<P>
House members care more about PAC money because they receive
proportionately more from PACs than senators, who raise contributions
from a larger base. In addition, many female and minority members of
the House contend they could not run competitive races without PAC
help.
</P>
<P>
Enthusiasm for the legislation is not high among rank-and-file
members on either side of the Capitol. But concern over the bill's
impact on incumbents' traditional fund-raising advantage is especially
strong in the House, where members face election every two instead of
six years.
</P>
<P>
Senate Republicans -- and some Democrats -- complain that House
Democrats are trying to have it both ways: in guaranteeing the bill's
defeat by giving Senate Republicans a bill they are sure to reject and
then blame them for the results.
</P>
<P>
``They're trying to find a politically correct way of killing the
bill ... by blaming us,'' complained Sen. James M. Jeffords (Vt.). He
is one of seven Republicans who helped break a filibuster against the
bill last year but who have said they will not do so again unless
several conditions are met, including reduced PAC limits and equal
rules for both chambers.
</P>
<P>
At Thursday's meeting with Speaker Thomas S. Foley (Wash.) and
other House leaders, Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell,
D-Maine, Rules Committee Chairman Wendell H. Ford, D-Ky., and Boren
warned that they wanted no part of such a strategy, one source said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Mitchell said he remained confident about passage
of the legislation but acknowledged that ``there is disagreement on
PACs.''
</P>
<P>
Rep. Sam Gejdenson (Conn.), chief architect of the House Democratic
plan, said he thought the problem could be worked out, but added, ``I
think the danger here is some (Senate) Republicans are threatening to
filibuster if they don't get this or that.''
</P>
<P>
Gejdenson also questioned the efficacy of lowering the maximum PAC
contribution. ``You're in effect sending people to more PACs. In
reality, that's not reform.'' Boren argues that large contributions
tend to increase the obligation that the recipient feels toward the
giver, often pouring in at the last minute for maximum impact.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the House could accept less than a $5,000 PAC limit,
Gejdenson said, ``I don't think there's any need for that to move.''
</P>
<P>
The conference to resolve differences between House and Senate
anti-crime bills -- which would reimpose the federal death penalty,
increase penalties for violent crimes and pump more money into prison
construction and crime prevention -- probably will get started shortly
after the recess and continue for several weeks, a Senate source said.
</P>
<P>
Many believe the toughest issue will be a House provision, opposed
by the Senate, to allow use of sentencing statistics to challenge
death penalties as racially discriminatory. A compromise on the issue
could be difficult, but House Judiciary Committee member Charles E.
Schumer, D-N.Y., said he would propose to ``make explicitly clear it's
not a quota bill and you can't use general population figures'' to
challenge death sentences.

 Pearl Jam's Complaint Prompts Antitrust Probe of Ticketmaster 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Justice Department has begun an antitrust investigation of Los
Angeles-based Ticketmaster after the rock band Pearl Jam accused the
giant ticket agency of pressuring promoters to boycott the band's
low-cost concert tour.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the Seattle-based band, the biggest selling rock group
in the country, complained on May 6 in a memo to the department's
antitrust division, accusing Ticketmaster, the world's largest ticket
agency, of exercising a monopoly over ticket distribution in this
country and using that influence to keep promoters from booking the
Pearl Jam tour this summer.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum to the Justice Department filed by Sullivan 
Cromwell, a prominent New York law firm that specializes in antitrust
issues, said that Ticketmaster has exclusive arrangements with all
important concert venues in the country and uses these arrangements to
``cement control over the distribution of tickets to concerts.''
</P>
<P>
Sales of Pearl Jam's last two albums exceeded $137 million.
Ticketmaster, which is privately held, last year reportedly earned
about $200 million in service and sponsorship fees on $1.3 billion in
sales of tickets to concert and sporting events.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Justice Department declined comment on the
probe. Ticketmaster and representatives for Pearl Jam also did not
comment.
</P>
<P>
The investigation is likely to focus new attention on a growing
furor over skyrocketing concert ticket prices and service fees, and
the arrangements among managers, promoters and service companies that
underlie pricing decisions.
</P>
<P>
Ticketmaster collects a phone service fee for tickets to rock and
pop concerts, typically $6 to $8 per ticket, although the agency's fee
for $350 tickets for Barbra Streisand shows amounted to $18 in some
cities. Ticketmaster pays a portion of the fees to maintain exclusive
long-term contracts with the owners of the largest concert venues. In
addition, Ticketmaster also pays a portion to some promoters,
managers, agents and artists.
</P>
<P>
In March, Pearl Jam sent letters to promoters vowing to perform
concerts this summer only at venues that charged $18 for a ticket and
no more than $1.80 for service or handling charges. A representative
of the band said Pearl Jam was seeking to keep prices in the range of
its young fans.
</P>
<P>
But sources in the concert industry said the group encountered
immediate resistance from Ticketmaster and members of the North
American Concert Promoters Association -- a McLean, Va.-based group
that represents the nation's largest promoters.
</P>
<P>
In two letters obtained by the Los Angeles Times, Ben Liss, the
executive director of the association, warned promoters that if they
booked Pearl Jam under the band's conditions, they could face possible
lawsuits from Ticketmaster.
</P>
<P>
``(Ticketmaster) views the Pearl Jam issue as an all or nothing
proposition,'' Liss wrote in one of his letters on March 24.
``(Ticketmaster chief executive Fred Rosen) has indicated that he
intends to take a very strong stand on this issue to protect
Ticketmaster's existing contracts with promoters and facilities and,
further, (Ticketmaster) will use all available remedies to protect
itself from outside third parties that attempt to interfere with those
existing contracts.''
</P>
<P>
Liss did not return phone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
After being turned down by virtually every promoter in the country
for bookings, Pearl Jam postponed its summer tour.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
As part of its preliminary inquiry, three Justice Department
officials from Washington flew into Los Angeles on May 24 to interview
music business figures, sources said.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the case said that Ticketmaster and members of the
North American Concert Promoters Association will soon be served with
``investigative demands'' -- the civil equivalent of a subpoena. The
demands would require the companies to turn over documents relevant to
the probe.
</P>
<P>
Ticketmaster has dominated the ticket market since 1991. In May of
that year, the Justice Department's Antitrust Division gave the
go-ahead for Ticketmaster to buy certain assets from Ticketron. At
that point, Ticketron was Ticketmaster's only major competitor.
</P>
<P>
The government inquiry comes at a time when Ticketmaster plans to
expand into a variety of new ventures, including movie ticket sales
and an interactive TV channel devoted to tickets, concert merchandise,
records and videos.
</P>
<P>
Ticketmaster is controlled by billionaire Paul G. Allen, who
co-founded software giant Microsoft and owns the Portland Trail
Blazers basketball team.
</P>
<P>
Allen reportedly paid more than $250 million last November for
controlling interest in Ticketmaster from the Chicago-based Pritzker
family, who retain a small piece of the firm as part of their vast
holdings, which include the Hyatt hotel chain.
</P>
<P>
Allen, who also holds a 24 percent stake in the America Online
interactive computer service, has already joined forces with EMI
Music, PolyGram, Sony Music and the Warner Music Group to create a
video music channel to challenge MTV.
</P>
<P>
Executives of those four recording conglomerates have been
subpoenaed in a separate antitrust probe by the Federal Trade
Commission, which is investigating compact disc pricing policies.

 Pope Returns Home From Hospital to a Changed Papacy (Vatican City) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
VATICAN CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having battled his doctors to an amicable draw, Pope
John Paul II left the hospital Friday to return to the Vatican and a
dramatically changed papacy.
</P>
<P>
The 74-year-old pope, who will be forced to modify his hectic
lifestyle, left Rome's Gemelli hospital four weeks after surgery to
repair a thighbone broken in a bathroom fall at his Vatican apartment.
He walked without a cane the few steps from the hospital doorway to a
waiting limousine.
</P>
<P>
Pope John Paul intends to make a Sunday morning appearance to
pilgrims from a window overlooking St. Peter's Square, and will
receive a visiting President Clinton as scheduled on Thursday, the
Vatican said.
</P>
<P>
``He may lean on a cane or against a table, but the Holy Father
will certainly be standing to greet the president,'' papal spokesman
Joaquin Navarro told reporters Friday.
</P>
<P>
Doctors, who say they are pleased with Pope John Paul's progress,
originally estimated that he would remain two to three weeks under
hospital care. They would have released him last week, they say,
except that he insisted on returning to the Vatican instead of to
Castel Gandolfo, the papal summer residence south of Rome where
therapy could have included swimming and garden walks.
</P>
<P>
As the price for returning directly to a hectic and more
restrictive Vatican life, the pope agreed to remain longer in the
hospital, Navarro said.
</P>
<P>
``Some say the broken leg is not all bad because it forces the pope
to take time to rest; he works too hard,'' said a European bishop at
the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
Boston Cardinal Bernard Law was with another cardinal and three
bishops who traveled to Gemelli Friday to present Pope John Paul with
a copy of the long-delayed English edition of their church's new
catechism.
</P>
<P>
``He was in a better state than I would have expected after such a
long hospitalization. He was himself,'' Law said.
</P>
<P>
Looking thin but fit and obviously in high spirits, Pope John Paul
used an aluminum walker to leave his hospital room. He stopped along
the way to chat for 20 minutes with children being treated for tumors.
</P>
<P>
``You have treated me very well, and I thank you very much,'' the
pope told doctors as he left, ``but don't expect to see me back here
soon.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Pope John Paul has shown a remarkable ability to
snap back from medical emergencies ranging from a gunshot to a colon
tumor to a broken collarbone.
</P>
<P>
The leg injury, however, marked his second fall and second broken
bone in five months. It sparked concern about the pope's increasing
frailty -- and speculation about a successor.
</P>
<P>
``We must pray for the Holy Father. We can see his energies
draining away as he tries to do more and more,'' one cardinal was
heard to observe after Easter Mass, three weeks before John Paul's
latest fall.
</P>
<P>
While he was in the hospital, the Vatican denied a report in
Spanish newspapers that the pontiff, whose left hand shakes, is
suffering from Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
Vatican administration, largely on hold in the pope's absence,
resumes next week with the publication of a letter Monday reaffirming
a ban on female priests.
</P>
<P>
But the hospital stay has put the papal schedule badly out of sync.
An unusual meeting of all the church's cardinals was canceled this
month; rescheduled for June, the conference is to discuss the state of
the Roman Catholic Church and its policies as it enters a third
millennium.

 Greenspan Defends Rate Hikes at Senate Hearing (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Federal Reserve began raising short-term interest
rates earlier this year ``without widespread indications that
inflation has picked up,'' Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said Friday,
because the central bank feared that low rates and rapid growth would
make inflation worse.
</P>
<P>
But two senior Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee, Paul S.
Sarbanes of Maryland and Jim Sasser of Tennessee, accused Greenspan
and the Fed of jumping the gun. They argued that it was certain that
higher rates would slow growth and cost the nation jobs, and that the
central bank could not be sure inflation would worsen even if interest
rates remained low.
</P>
<P>
``We've got a basic disagreement, Mr. Chairman,'' Sasser told
Greenspan. ``I don't see the inflation, and I'm willing to run a tiny
little risk (to) get some quarters of robust economic growth going
here, not putter along indefinitely at 3 percent, 2.5 percent
(growth), with high rates of unemployment.''
</P>
<P>
Greenspan told the hearing, ``History unequivocally demonstrates
that monetary accommodation (taking no action) when the economy is
strong risks a significant acceleration of inflation.''
</P>
<P>
Committee Chairman Donald T. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., noted that with
an upward revision in growth figures for the first three months of
this year, announced Friday by the Commerce Department, the economy
has grown by 3.7 percent in the year ended in March. At the same time,
employment was up by 2.3 million jobs and the unemployment rate down
by a full percentage point.
</P>
<P>
Riegle, unlike his colleagues, did not directly criticize the Fed.
Instead, he said that while he does not want to lose the gains that
have been made against inflation, ``it would be foolhardy to us to
needlessly bring this economic expansion to a premature shutdown.''
</P>
<P>
The Banking chairman urged Greenspan not to raise interest rates
any further while the economy ``digests'' the 1.25 percentage point
increase in short-term rates that the Fed engineered since early
February. ``I think we may need a pause here to sort of see how these
adjustments are taking hold.
</P>
<P>
The upward revision in first quarter growth figures by the Commerce
Department, from a 2.6 percent annual rate advance estimate last month
to 3 percent rate in Friday's release, caught virtually all analysts
by surprise. On the basis of the additional data available since last
month to the statisticians who compile the figures for the gross
domestic product, the analysts had been looking for a reduction of a
quarter of a percentage point or more rather than an increase.
</P>
<P>
However, the analysts had missed a surprising jump in non-defense
federal spending in March which changed what had been listed as a
decline for first quarter federal spending into an increase.
</P>
<P>
But the analysts generally said that the revision did little to
change either their sense of the state of the economy or their
expectations about growth in the April-June period, which several put
at 3.5 percent to 4 percent or slightly more. Part of the higher
growth this quarter is due to a rebound from the effects of severe
winter weather that reduced economic activity early in the year,
particularly in construction.
</P>
<P>
At the Banking Committee hearing, Greenspan declined to predict
what growth would be this quarter or how high it could be in the
future without triggering more rapid inflation.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Fed chairman argued that keeping inflation low was the
best way to maximize economic growth over time.
</P>
<P>
``The evidence is increasingly that low inflation means higher
economic activity, greater growth in standards of living, greater real
wages, not lower,'' Greenspan said. ``I think we're all endeavoring to
find ways to get solid economic growth, which is sustainable and which
is not periodically upended by ... destabilizing bouts'' of inflation.
</P>
<P>
``If we are successful in our current endeavors, there will not be
an increase in overall inflation, and trends toward price stability
will be extended.''
</P>
<P>
Greenspan explained that there is a substantial lag between changes
in interest rates and the resulting changes in economic activity. And
that means the Fed ``must implement the necessary monetary policy
adjustments in advance of the potential emergence of inflationary
pressures, so as to forestall their actual occurrence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
But Sasser and Sarbanes repeatedly rejected the Fed chairman's
argument. The Fed should stop ``buying into the notion that as soon as
you get some good growth, you've got to move to cut it down because
there's some phantom inflation that you perceive that needs to be
addressed, when the underlying figures don't support it,'' Sarbanes
responded.

 Jazz Trumpeter Red Rodney Dead at 66 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Red Rodney, a driving force in the bebop movement of the 1940s and
'50s that spread from New York's Birdland to envelop the rest of the
country, died Friday.
</P>
<P>
Leonard Feather, jazz critic for the Los Angeles Times, said Rodney
died of cancer in New York City. He was 66.
</P>
<P>
Rodney, the trumpeter who helped make the Charlie Parker quintet a
definitive unit in the early days of progessive jazz, had experienced
health problems throughout his life.
</P>
<P>
As with Parker, Dizzy Gillespie was an early influence on the young
trumpeter from Philadelphia who was born Robert Chudnick.
</P>
<P>
Rodney -- who was portrayed by Mike Zelnicker in the Parker biopic
``Bird,'' had begun studying brass when he was in his teens.
</P>
<P>
He was working with a Philadelphia swing orchestra when he first
heard the innovative Gillespie harmonics. Gillespie listened to him
and took the 18-year-old to New York where he met Parker. He said the
first thing the troubled famous saxophonist did was to borrow $10.
Rodney also was allowed to sit in with the Parker group.
</P>
<P>
Rodney, who was made a member of the elite Downbeat (magazine) Hall
of Fame, joined the Gene Krupa band after learning that Parker and
Gillespie were traveling to California where Krupa would be
performing. He returned to New York with Krupa, stayed a year, then
began working clubs on 52nd Street. He was in Woody Herman's brass
section in New York in 1949 when trumpeter Miles Davis left Parker and
Rodney took his place as part of the fabled quintet.
</P>
<P>
Rodney -- short, red-headed and Jewish -- found that he had to pass
himself off as a racial oddity to be accepted in a field dominated by
blacks.
</P>
<P>
Parker, he recalled, would introduce him to audiences as ``Albino
Red.''
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Rodney said Parker not only led him to the forefront of the bop
movement but also ``inspired'' him to start using drugs so ``maybe I
could play that good,'' as he told Feather in 1988.
</P>
<P>
He battled drugs for several years but by the 1970s had put his
destructive habits behind him and was touring Europe, playing
regularly behind star acts in Las Vegas and recording with a group
called Bebop Preservation Society. In the early 1980s he started
working full time with his own jazz quintet and appeared throughout
the country.
</P>
<P>
In 1980 he teamed with Ira Sullivan -- who played both reeds and
brass -- in one of the then most popular combos in jazz.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music called Rodney ``one of
the best bebop trumpeters'' of the period and ``certainly one of the
first white players to gain credibility and experience in the field.''
</P>
<P>
Rodney's survivors include his wife, Helene.

 Air Quality Improves in West, Worsens in East (San Francisco) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 10-year study of smog in national parks has found
that air quality is improving in Western states but continuing to
deteriorate in the East despite tougher laws aimed at halting air
pollution.
</P>
<P>
In the summertime, remote parks and wilderness areas in the East
share the same hazy air as big cities like Washington. In fact, the
study found, visible air pollution in the two eastern parks studied is
worse than in Los Angeles during the summer.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the University of California, Davis, who conducted
the study of a dozen national parks, came to the unexpected conclusion
that the West is doing a better job of controlling the sulfur
emissions that cause visible air pollution and acid rain. The findings
were published in the latest issue of the journal Atmospheric
Environment.
</P>
<P>
``The measures used in the East to clean up the air aren't working
the way they should and the air quality is getting worse,'' said
physicist Thomas Cahill, head of the UC Davis Air Quality Group. ``The
measures used in the West are working, and the air is getting
better.''
</P>
<P>
Cahill called for tougher laws to reduce sulfur emissions,
particularly in the East. ``The bottom line is that the Clean Air Act
may not accomplish all that it was supposed to do, which is to clean
up the air of the eastern United States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The research, the first of its kind, found that the United States
is divided down the middle into two distinct zones of sulfur
emissions, which can travel hundreds of miles from their original
sources.
</P>
<P>
In the East, the level of sulfate pollutants is often eight times
as high as in the West because there are many more power plants, fewer
emission controls and higher humidity, which accelerates the
conversion of sulfur emissions into visible acidic particles.
</P>
<P>
Sulfate pollution is the primary cause of visible smog and, in
heavy concentrations, can severely damage trees. By contrast, ozone,
which is not visible, is the main component of smog that causes health
problems in humans and can also damage vegetation.
</P>
<P>
To see how air pollution is affecting visibility in some of the
most remote and pristine spots in the country, the UC Davis
researchers took air samples at scenic spots, such as the mountains
above Yosemite Valley and the bottom of the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
The researchers found that the air quality improved in national
parks in Arizona, Colorado, Utah and Oregon between 1982 and 1992,
while holding steady in Yosemite, the Grand Canyon, Bryce Canyon
National Park in Utah and two national parks in Texas.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
However, visible pollution at Shenendoah National Park in Virginia
and Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee jumped nearly 40
percent during the same period.
</P>
<P>
``On many days in the summer, visitors have no view at all except a
strange, gray fog from many of the most popular lookouts,'' Cahill
said. ``But it's not fog. It's mostly sulfate particles, with lots of
water attached. At times in the East, it is almost pure dilute
sulfuric acid.''
</P>
<P>
Cahill said the UC Davis findings support the theory that the
sulfate haze hanging over much of the eastern United States and Europe
is countering the effect of global warming in that region by
scattering light that would otherwise heat the earth.
</P>
<P>
He said this finding could explain why temperatures have not
increased as much in the northern hemisphere as expected under
scientific models of global warming.
</P>
<P>
Some scientists have maintained that the lack of temperature rise
in northern climates refutes the theory that the planet is warming up
because emissions of carbon dioxide are holding in heat.

 Renewal of Trade Status Met With Relief (Beijing) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Clinton's decision to sever the link between
China's trade status and human rights could provide an opportunity for
China and the United States to deal with each other on a normal basis
for the first time since the bloody crackdown five years ago against
pro-democracy demonstrators, Chinese and Western analysts said today.
</P>
<P>
``The current situation offers a historic opportunity for the
enhancement of Sino-American relations,'' the Chinese Foreign Ministry
said, adding that China will continue to make ``major efforts'' to
improve relations.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the threat of not renewing China's most-favored-nation
trading status has ``impaired the bilateral trade and economic
exchanges and the overall relations between the two countries,'' the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
``We hope that the U.S. government, on its part, will take a
realistic and forward-looking stand in the overall interests of
Sino-American relations and take concrete action to show its sincerity
for enhancing relations,'' it added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese statement also expressed ``regret'' that sanctions
imposed by the United States after the Tiananmen Square crackdown
remain in place. In an apparent reference to Clinton's comments about
continuing serious human rights abuses in China, the Foreign Ministry
also accused the United States of ``making unwarranted charges about
(the) human rights situation in China.''
</P>
<P>
But the overall tone of the statement was upbeat, and the rhetoric
was restrained.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's move is likely to reassure China's leaders on a
fundamental issue. The decision shows that ``it's not the intent of
the administration to destabilize China or overthrow the regime,''
said Michel Oksenberg, a longtime China scholar who recently visited
Beijing and met with top Chinese leaders.
</P>
<P>
Among China's aging rulers, the elimination of the threat to revoke
trade privileges over human rights abuses will strengthen the hand of
more reform-minded leaders to argue for a wide-ranging relationship
with the United States. This becomes especially important because of
the uncertainty surrounding the political succession after senior
leader Deng Xiaoping, who turns 90 in August.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Clinton's flip-flop on China policy has raised
questions about his personal credibility among the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
``The Chinese know they have won,'' said Wang Xizhe, a veteran
dissident who was released last year after nearly 14 years in jail for
his pro-democracy activities.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview from the southern city of Guangzhou, he
said he welcomed the decision. He pointed out that in the end, it was
the United States that gave in.
</P>
<P>
``I think the Chinese saw early on that the United States is a
paper tiger,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
This raises the question of how seriously the Chinese will take
Clinton's word -- or threats -- on issues such as Washington's relations
with Taiwan and bilateral trade issues, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
``It is always important for the Chinese to feel that we are quite
credible in what we say,'' said a Western analyst who has long had
dealings with Chinese leaders. ``If people respect you on that level,
it usually saves both sides a lot of heartache, and there is less
testing of each side by the other.''
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the questions of credibility and trust might carry
less weight if the Clinton administration follows through with broad
strategic discussions with the Chinese, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
This is particularly true in the military realm, where high-level
contacts had been frozen until last fall. A visit to the United States
of a top Chinese general had been put on hold while the two sides
awaited the outcome of the trade decision.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a delegation that includes former defense secretary
Robert S. McNamara and four senior retired U.S. military officials,
including three generals, has been holding talks in Beijing for the
past week with Chinese military officials.
</P>
<P>
``It's important to see what kind of role China sees for itself in
the region, what resources it is devoting to its military budget and
what their strategic doctrine is,'' said David Lampton, president of
the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, which sponsored the
trip.
</P>
<P>
In the area of human rights, some Chinese dissidents said there
might be setbacks in the short run as a result of Clinton's decision.
But over the longer term, greater contacts with the West and rapid
development of China's economy may lead to increased freedom, said
veteran activist Wang.
</P>
<P>
Wang acknowledged that his release in February of 1993 was due in
part to international pressure. For that, he said, he will always be
grateful. But those activists who have chosen to stay in China long
ago made their own preparations to deal with the authorities,
regardless of outside pressure such as the threat of losing the
trading status.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the one dissident who felt most strongly that the United
States needed to be tough on China could not be reached for comment.
China's most prominent political activist, Wei Jingsheng, has been in
police custody since April 1.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and Western analysts say China's actions in human rights
area are driven more by its own domestic-stability concerns than by
pressure from the West.
</P>
<P>
``China is undergoing change at a speed that borders on the
uncontrollable,'' said Ken Lieberthal, a China expert from the
University of Michigan in a telephone interview in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
``It has a leadership that is desperately trying to shift that
country from a typical Soviet-style command economy to a typical East
Asian type of economic miracle. And it believes firmly that it must
find a path that combines entrepreneurial flexibility with political
stability,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese officials have often complained in the past that the U.S.
position on human rights often comes out sounding like the United
States has a morally superior position when dealing with China. For a
country whose leaders still remember China's bitter humiliations at
the hands of foreign powers, such a posture often stiffens the Chinese
resolve not to give in to American demands.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, when a U.S. official had to visit Beijing for
consultations, the message about the importance of human rights was
not raised, and the meeting was very fruitful, according to a Western
diplomat.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's decision was praised around Asia, where many leaders,
particularly Singapore's elder statesman Lee Kuan Yew, have been
critical of the policy to link trade and human rights.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, Phil Carmichael, president of the American Chamber of
Commerce here, told reporters that while the chamber did not support
Clinton's ban on U.S. imports of Chinese guns and ammunition, it
welcomed the move to separate trade from human rights. ``Let's declare
victory and move onto the next issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He said U.S. businesses in China were willing to discuss Clinton's
suggestion of a ``voluntary code of conduct'' to address human rights
concerns. But most American business executives have said their
companies follow their own codes of business ethics.

 Democrats Seek to Go Easy on D.C. Mayor as They View 
 Specter of Former Mayor's Return (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Democrats in the White House, Congress and federal
agencies are anxious about the possibility that Marion Barry could be
elected mayor and are seeking ways to address the District's problems
without hurting Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly's re-election prospects.
</P>
<P>
As a result, some have scaled back their efforts to hold Kelly
personally accountable for the city's problems with public housing,
finances and other matters.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Department of Housing and Urban Development
recently formed a joint committee with Kelly to oversee the city's
troubled public housing program, rather than seizing complete control,
in part because they sensed that a federal takeover of the department
would hurt the mayor too much politically and could help Barry win the
Democratic primary, sources familiar with the decision said.
</P>
<P>
The joint approach permitted HUD to exercise additional influence
over the program while enabling the mayor to indicate she had asked
for the agency's help and supported the new partnership.
</P>
<P>
HUD officials consulted in advance on their decision with White
House staff, who approved of the way it was handled, a White House
official said. A Congressional source who discussed the matter with
White House officials also confirmed that the mayor's race played an
important role in the decision not to simply take over the public
housing agency.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the mayoral race and the implications of a possible
Barry victory are being widely discussed in Washington. However, many
Democrats in Congress and elsewhere, including D.C. Del. Eleanor
Holmes Norton, will not disclose their views about the mayor's race
because they could arouse a political backlash or be accused of
meddling.
</P>
<P>
A White House official said: ``We are very cognizant that there is
a highly charged mayor's race in the city, and we would be careful to
try not to influence it. I think we would like to let the voters of
D.C. decide that one.''
</P>
<P>
Tony Coelho -- a former member of the House of Representatives who
is now an unofficial political adviser to the White House and who has
close personal ties to senior White House officials -- said there was
fear in the White House and on Capitol Hill that a Barry victory would
damage the Democratic party's image because of the former mayor's drug
conviction.
</P>
<P>
Coelho said he expects Republicans to use the city's troubles as an
issue in this year's elections because Democrats are in charge of the
White House and the Congress. He said a Barry victory in the
Democratic primary would make the Democrats even more vulnerable, and
that leaders of the party are worried about it.
</P>
<P>
``It is legitimate for this government, the Congress and the
administration to try to help this city out,'' Coelho said. ``It is
the nation's capital. An embarrassment here is an embarrassment
internationally, so it is critically important they pay attention to
it. The implications (of a Barry victory) are that the comics go wild,
and the press goes wild and makes it into a big international story.''
</P>
<P>
Barry's entrance into the mayor's race and the enthusiastic support
he has received from his base of supporters has prompted numerous
conversations among Democratic leaders seeking to determine his
chances for victory, according to interviews with members of Congress
and staff members. One Congressional source said Barry's campaign had
sparked a ``deathbed fear'' in Democrats in Congress and around
Washington.
</P>
<P>
``The DNC (Democratic National Committee) doesn't need this,'' the
source said.
</P>
<P>
Rep. James T. Walsh, R-N.Y., the ranking Republican on the District
appropriations subcommittee, said Barry's campaign after his
conviction on drug charges had become a topic of discussion in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
``It concerns me a great deal,'' Walsh said. ``The image of
Washington D.C. was tarnished by his term, and I certainly don't want
to give him any advantage.
</P>
<P>
``The District of Columbia is in difficulty now vis-a-vis
Congress,'' Walsh said. ``That (Barry's election) certainly would not
make relations easier. There are very strong feelings against the
former mayor on the Hill.''

 Greenspan Publicly Defends Fed's Rate Increases (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan on
Friday mounted his first public defense of the Fed's repeated interest
rate increases this year, telling a skeptical Congress that the
central bank had no alternative but to hike rates to reduce the threat
of inflation.
</P>
<P>
Confronted with stiff criticism from leading Democratic lawmakers,
Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee that market pressures
ultimately would have brought on higher interest rates even if the Fed
had not acted.
</P>
<P>
``Delaying our actions would not have been constructive,''
Greenspan said. He also stressed that he believes the Fed's actions
should now lead to solid economic growth without rapidly rising
prices.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the government said the economy grew at a 3 percent pace
in the first quarter of the year, up slightly from an earlier estimate
of 2.6 percent, but down sharply from the 7 percent level in the
fourth quarter of 1993.
</P>
<P>
``Overall ... this looks like a well-balanced economy,'' Greenspan
said. ``This is looking to me as good as I've seen an economy evolving
in a balanced form in a very long period of time. The economy is
moving at a fairly respectable pace ... it could go on for a quite a
long period of time, provided that inflationary imbalances don't
emerge.''
</P>
<P>
Since February, the Fed has raised short-term interest rates four
times in a controversial effort to cool the economy before it gets so
overheated that it begins to generate a surge in inflation. Fed
officials are now convinced they kept interest rates too low for too
long as the economy began to recover last year, and that before they
acted in February the economy was growing at a pace that was too rapid
to be sustained without a run-up in prices.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan noted Friday that the central bank's easy money policies
of 1993 also may have led to an unhealthy increase in speculative
activity in the financial markets, and said Fed officials felt they
had to raise rates to burst that bubble.
</P>
<P>
Leading senators complained that the Fed was too concerned about
appeasing the nation's financial markets, and had moved so
aggressively that its interest rate increases are now hurting average
Americans.
</P>
<P>
Committee Chairman Donald Riegle, D-Mich., urged Greenspan to pause
for a time. ``It would be foolhardy for us to needlessly bring this
economic expansion to a premature shutdown,'' Riegle said.
</P>
<P>
Other committee members complained that the Fed has raised rates to
curb inflation at a time when there is virtually no evidence of rising
prices.
</P>
<P>
The Fed's moves to raise short-term rates have had a cascading
effect on other market interest rates and the rest of the economy by
making it more expensive for businesses and consumers to borrow either
to invest or make purchases. And the lawmakers noted that the American
economy is now more sensitive than ever to changes in Fed interest
rate policy because so many mortgages and other consumer loans carry
adjustable rates, which can be changed relatively quickly.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Senator Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., who is also vice chairman of the
Joint Economic Committee, also complained that Greenspan was
tightening monetary policy at a time when the Clinton administration
and Congress have already moved to tighten fiscal policy with last
year's deficit-reduction agreement.
</P>
<P>
He argued that since Greenspan had repeatedly urged Congress to cut
the deficit, the Fed should now reward them by keeping interest rates
low. So if both fiscal and monetary policies are restrained, Sarbanes
asked, ``the question then is where is the impetus to come from in
order to get some economic growth and some job restoration?''
</P>
<P>
But Greenspan disagreed that Fed policies would sacrifice the
health of the overall economy to please Wall Street investors.
</P>
<P>
``I don't acknowledge there are differences between the goals of
Wall Street and the goals of Main Street,'' Greenspan said. ``The
evidence is increasingly that low inflation means higher economic
activity (and) greater growth.''

 British Officials Downplay Reports of Deadly Bacteria (London) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Senior British health officials sought Friday to play down
the widely circulated press reports that a deadly bacteria is
threatening the population.
</P>
<P>
``The public should be reassured there is no killer bug sweeping
the country,'' said Dr. Diana Walford, director of the Public Health
Laboratory Service, attacking the barrage of publicity.
</P>
<P>
She said there have been 15 cases of the disease, called
necrotising fasciitis, since Jan. 1 -- a rate of occurrence that she
said is not out of the ordinary.
</P>
<P>
News that the disease was breaking out in parts of Gloucestershire
in western England surfaced last weekend, and the British tabloid
press painted horrifying visions of a virus that can devour human
flesh in a matter of hours.
</P>
<P>
``Curse of the Killer Bacteria,'' bannered The Sun, Britain's
largest-selling daily, and ``Flesh Bug Ate My Brother in 18 Hours.''
</P>
<P>
``I Watched Killer Bug Eat My Body,'' read another tabloid's
headlines.
</P>
<P>
Even more sedate papers like The Times of London reported:
``Bacteria That Eat the Flesh'' and ``Flesh-Eater on the Move.''
</P>
<P>
Walford said press reports give the impression that the 15 cases -- 
11 of which resulted in death -- all occurred in a sudden epidemic,
instead of over the last five months.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that necrotising fasciitis, a virulent form of the
streptococcus bacteria, ``remains a rare disease.''
</P>
<P>
The British scare has generated worldwide concern, with governments
from Austria to New Zealand checking incidents of the infection. In
Norway, the disease has killed 25 people so far this year, the
country's National Institute of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials estimated that up to 450 Americans may have died
each year from 1989 to 1991 from the infection, according to the World
Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
British Health Secretary Virginia Bottomley appealed for calm,
insisting that everything possible is being done to fight the bug.
</P>
<P>
``There is no evidence that the numbers we are seeing are
untoward,'' Bottomley said. ``It is important not to get it out of
proportion. This is a situation where everything that can be done has
been done.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Government officials did acknowledge that the disease could be
horrifying to those who contract it. The infection attacks the fleshy
parts of the body, eating it away like gangrene. In the worst cases,
death can occur within hours.
</P>
<P>
``I feel enormously for anyone who has a member of the family
involved,'' Bottomley said, ``but I don't want every family in the
country to be panicked.''
</P>
<P>
The tabloid press sent reporters to find victims and their
relatives, and recounted their stories in lurid tales that brought
invoked images of an outer-space invasion.
</P>
<P>
As the Financial Times suggested: ``Mutant flesh-eating superbugs,
capable of killing a healthy adult within hours, are rampaging their
way through Britain. Or, to put it another way, the media is indulging
in one of its periodic frenzies of terrifying the public with a
medical horror story.''

 Nuclear Watchdog Says N. Korea Steps Up Fuel Rod Withdrawal (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The director of the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) urgently warned the United Nations Friday that North Korea has
recently accelerated its withdrawal of fuel rods from a nuclear
reactor, raising new concerns about North Korean intentions.
</P>
<P>
During a series of negotiations with top IAEA officials this week,
North Korea not only spurned the agency's demand that it halt the fuel
rod withdrawal, but also said it could not accept demands for special
storage of some key fuel rods, Hans Blix said in his letter to U.N.
Secretary General Boutros-Boutros Ghali.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and IAEA officials have said that the fuel rods must be
preserved for future radioactive measurements aimed at determining how
much plutonium North Korea extracted in recent years from spent
nuclear fuel. Plutonium is a key element in nuclear arms, and U.S.
officials suspect North Korea of trying to develop an arsenal of such
weapons.
</P>
<P>
The North Koreans told the IAEA that special storage of the
withdrawn rods would not meet ``their political constraints,'' Blix
said.
</P>
<P>
Blix's letter, obtained by The Washington Post, warned that North
Korea has withdrawn almost half of the reactor's estimated 8,000 fuel
rods and is continuing to withdraw them ``at a very fast pace . . .
not in line with the information previously conveyed to the agency.''
The agency had initially predicted the fuel withdrawal, which began
two weeks ago, would not be completed for another six weeks.
</P>
<P>
Blix wrote that his agency's ability to inspect the rods would be
``lost within days'' if the North Koreans proceed as they have been.
Unless North Korea changes its position immediately, he added, ``the
agency will not be in a position to verify the amount'' of plutonium
the country has accumulated or verify that North Korea is not
developing a nuclear arsenal. He asked that the matter be brought
immediately to the attention of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Robert Gallucci, the senior U.S. envoy for Korean matters, warned
Friday in an interview that if North Korea proceeded, Washington would
cancel plans for new high-level talks desired by North Korea to chart
a solution to the nuclear dispute and foster improved relations.
Gallucci also said the continuing withdrawal of the fuel rods would
``force us to go back to the Security Council where sanctions would be
one of the options.'' Other U.S. officials said they hoped China would
intervene by sending a tough message to North Korea. In a sign of
Washington's growing pessimism, however, U.S. officials Friday began
reviewing two draft statements condemning the North Korean action with
other members of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The IAEA and U.S. warnings came after North Korean officials, at
talks this week with mid-level U.S. diplomats in New York, rejected a
U.S. proposal to begin the high-level talks promptly. The North
Koreans complained that they could not accept Washington's condition
that the talks could be held only if the key fuel rods were preserved.
</P>
<P>
North Korea's actions bolstered suspicions among some U.S.
officials that the country is determined to hide how much plutonium it
obtained by reprocessing spent fuel rods withdrawn from the reactor in
1989. Moreover, the officials said, if North Korea responds to
sanctions by barring further inspections, it would then be able
extract enough additional plutonium from spent fuel rods to
manufacture four or five nuclear devices.
</P>
<P>
North Korean officials said their decision to reject the
inspections was justified by the country's ``unique status'' under the
nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, a global accord aimed at halting the
spread of nuclear arms. North Korea claims it achieved this special
status in 1993 by threatening to withdraw from the treaty and then
suspending that threat under U.S. pressure.
</P>
<P>
The IAEA has repeatedly said North Korea has no special status and
must comply with all the inspection pledges it made in January 1992.
Among those pledges was a commitment to international verification of
how much plutonium the country had extracted from spent fuel rods
since the reactor started operating in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Two of the four IAEA negotiators in Pyongyang plan to depart for
the agency's headquarters in Vienna today, with the other two staying
behind at the site of the reactor in Yongbyon, north of the capital,
to observe the withdrawal of fuel rods, Blix said.
</P>
<P>
In this case, the agency would declare formally that it could no
longer maintain adequate safeguards against nuclear weapons
development there.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Warren Christopher told an Asia Society meeting
in New York Friday that ``confrontation is emphatically not our
preferred path.'' But he said that if ``North Korea rejects the
negotiations we've offered,'' Washington would be well-positioned to
``mobilize the international community to take sterner measures.''
</P>
<P>
Christopher added that sanctions would ``condemn'' North Korea to
continued isolation and economic deprivation, while preserving its
status as a political pariah.

 China's Trade Strategy Proves Superior to the United States(Beijing) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the end, China's success in overcoming human rights
opposition to win renewal of trade privileges from the United States
boiled down to one simple truth: The Chinese regime demonstrated a
much better understanding of the American political system than the
Clinton administration did of the Chinese system.
</P>
<P>
The key to Beijing's strategy was to divert attention from human
rights issues by using the blinding lights of China's booming economy
and huge potential market. By doing this, Chinese officials said, they
successfully broadened the terms of the debate inside the United
States. As a result, the Clinton administration found itself fighting
back on many fronts, often against some of its own most powerful
citizens.
</P>
<P>
Time and again during the past year, the Chinese effectively called
on U.S. big business to do most of the heavy lifting in carrying their
case to the American public and President Clinton himself. Major
league companies such as Boeing, AT T, General Electric and United
Technologies were more than happy to go to bat for the Chinese with
their powerful public relations machines.
</P>
<P>
``My feeling is that a few huge companies had more at stake than in
the past,'' said Anne Stevenson-Yang, Beijing director of the U.S.
China Business Council. American executives, for example, lobbied hard
for a last-minute meeting between Clinton and China Vice Premier Zou
Jiahua in early May that was one of the turning points in the
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
When confronted with allegations of human rights abuses, the
Chinese leadership coolly responded by changing the subject, citing
the thousands of U.S. jobs that depend on Chinese orders for
commercial aircraft and telecommunications equipment.
</P>
<P>
This approach was used in November when Chinese President Jiang
Zemin held his first summit with Clinton during a Seattle visit. Jiang
ostentatiously made a point of visiting the family of a Boeing worker.
His Chinese staff noted for all who would listen that China buys one
out of every seven Boeing aircraft made.
</P>
<P>
This effort continued right up until Clinton's Thursday news
conference announcing renewal of China's most-favored-nation trading
status -- the same rights that the United States grants all but a few
pariah states. The same day, the Wall Street Journal reported that
China is ``within weeks'' of finalizing an agreement to buy 50 new
aircraft from Boeing, an order worth $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
On another front often very embarrassing to the Clinton
administration, the Beijing regime romanced American allies with
attractive business opportunities to accentuate the U.S. isolation on
the human rights question.
</P>
<P>
For example, at the same time Clinton was in Seattle presenting
Jiang with a list of human rights concerns, German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl traveled to Beijing with German business leaders to sign $3.5
billion worth of contracts. This spring, French Prime Minister Edouard
Balladur arrived in Beijing with a similar entourage.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government made the point abundantly clear: Only the
United States put human rights conditions on trade. If the Clinton
administration kept insisting, China could take its business
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Finally, during the year leading up to the Clinton decision, China
hosted and feted hundreds of American political and business leaders.
</P>
<P>
During all of 1992, for example, only 11 members of Congress -- 
eight representatives and three senators -- came to China. But between
June 1993 and June 1994, Beijing was swarmed by 47 U.S.
representatives and 14 senators.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
The incoming planeloads of American politicians was partly due to
the efforts of U.S. Ambassador J. Stapleton Roy, who encouraged
Congress members to visit China and witness its development firsthand.
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese were quick to welcome the visitors, spending
thousands of dollars to feed them and show them the sights. As a
result, they may have won a few extra votes for their cause. Many
Congress members indicated that the bleak land of torture and abuse
described in news reports appeared instead to be a land in the throes
of rapid, healthy development.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
China was finally able to win the unyoking of human rights
questions and trade relations, while making only a handful of mostly
token concessions to the American side.
</P>
<P>
This was the prize they wanted most but had been unable to win from
a hostile Democratic Congress during the Bush administration, despite
Bush's personal support for separating trade and human rights issues.
</P>
<P>
In explaining why the Chinese had not fully responded to American
demands on human rights Clinton explained that China was under great
strain from tensions between its far-flung provinces and the central
government. This is a common argument espoused by senior Communist
Party leaders when they explain the need for measures to insure
``stability.''
</P>
<P>
Borrowing another common Chinese argument, Clinton noted that Asian
societies like China have a more authoritarian tradition. He cited as
an example the recent case of American teen-ager Michael Fay,
sentenced to several strokes of a rattan cane for a vandalism charge
in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Even when the Chinese did make concessions to the Americans, such
as the release earlier this month of prominent dissidents Wang Juntao
and Chen Ziming, they timed them impeccably so as to win maximum
possible credit from the Clinton administration, which in the later
stages of the game was desperate for any such sign from the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
While business delegations from the United States were welcomed
into Beijing like heads of state,
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who came to China in
March ostensibly to tie up the package on human rights, was given one
of the frostiest receptions an American diplomat ever received in the
Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
The State Department's special human rights envoy, assistant
Secretary of State John Shattuck, who came to China to prepare for the
Christopher visit, was accused by authorities of breaking Chinese law
because he met with prominent dissident Wei Jingsheng during the
visit.
</P>
<P>
Adding insult to injury in the Shattuck episode, the Chinese
authorities subsequently jailed Wei for allegedly telling Shattuck
that China's most-favored-nation status should not be renewed unless
improvements in the rights arena were made. Wei was still in jail when
Clinton renewed the trading status Thursday.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
When cornered on some tough points -- such as the thousands of
political prisoners in Chinese jails and labor reform camps -- Beijing
turned the tables on the Americans.
</P>
<P>
In response to U.S. objections to the export of goods made in
Chinese prisons, for example, China commissioned a series of reports
in respectable international publications documenting examples of
American prison exports to other countries.
</P>
<P>
Under a barrage of human rights allegations from the West, China
responded that its first obligation to human rights was feeding and
housing its people, something the United States so far had been unable
to do with its enormous homeless population.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the Chinese adopted a strategy of aiming their diplomatic
efforts directly at Clinton, while shunting aside his most prominent
emissaries.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Although American policy on the human rights/trade question was
vilified in the Chinese press, Clinton himself was never personally
attacked.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, when the Chinese authorities in May released dissident
Wang, they made it clear that it was because Clinton had personally
requested the release on medical grounds. Wang suffers from hepatitis.
</P>
<P>
Confident that it had already won the diplomatic match-up over
human rights through its other efforts, particularly by marshaling
American private business interests to its cause, China viewed the
releases of dissidents Wang and Chen as a way of ``giving face'' to
the young American president, still a neophyte in international
affairs.
</P>
<P>
During his campaign for the presidency, Clinton repeatedly attacked
Bush for ``coddling dictators'' in China.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, however, Clinton succeeded where Bush had failed,
removing human rights conditions from trade matters between the two
countries.

 Bar Review Course Agrees to Aid Disabled Students (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The nation's largest bar examination review course
signed a consent decree with the Justice Department Friday, agreeing
to provide sign language interpreters, transcription services and
other costly auxiliary aids to students with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which settled a civil complaint the department
brought against the owners of the Bar/Bri bar review course, could
have broad implications for disabled students preparing to take bar
exams and certified public accountant exams. They often have to pay 10
times more for interpreters or special materials than the cost of the
review course tuition.
</P>
<P>
``This is a major step forward. All the others will be on notice
that they have to provide the same services to the disabled,'' said
Arlene Mayerson, an attorney for the Disability Rights Education and
Defense Fund, based in Berkeley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
Deval L. Patrick, assistant attorney general for civil rights, said
that as a result of the agreement, ``The gateways to the legal and
accounting professions have now been opened wider for persons with
disabilities.''
</P>
<P>
He said the agreement ``should serve as a model to all the other
review courses this nation has to offer.''
</P>
<P>
In its complaint, the Justice Department accused Harcourt Brace
Legal and Professional Publications Inc., owner of Bar/Bri, of
violating the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) by failing to
provide sign language interpreters to two deaf California students,
and failing to provide Braille copies of course materials to a blind
student from New York.
</P>
<P>
The suit also alleged that Bar/Bri regularly denied requests for
interpreters and Braille materials, instead offering transcripts of
course lectures to hearing-impaired students and recordings of written
materials to blind students.
</P>
<P>
Under the consent decree, the Chicago-based Bar/Bri, which each
year prepares about 20,000 law school graduates for bar examinations
in 25 jurisdictions, agreed to provide a wide range of special
services to the disabled within 60 days. They include interpreters,
computer-aided transcription services, special listening devices for
the hearing-impaired, note-takers, Braille materials, large-print
materials, audio tapes and other aids.
</P>
<P>
Bar/Bri also agreed to pay $25,000 in civil penalties and $28,000
in compensatory damages to cover the costs of special services for a
blind student in New York and a deaf student in California who filed
complaints against the company.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Becker CPA Review Inc., which prepares students
for the certified public accountants' exam, signed a similar consent
decree that would make its courses accessible to students with
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
Patrick said that Harcourt cooperated fully to settle the
complaint, entering into negotiations promptly after being notified of
its alleged violations and implementing many of the new procedures
months before the final settlement.
</P>
<P>
Bar/Bri president Richard Conviser said that supplying a sign
language interpreter for the intensive review course costs about
$11,000, compared to the $600 to $1,000 for tuition.
</P>
<P>
``But we are pleased to enter into this consent decree. We believe
it's the right thing to do, and we believe it can be a model for other
courses throughout the country,'' he said. Conviser estimated that
less than 1 percent of Bar/Bri students are disabled.
</P>
<P>
However, Mayerson said the costs will be minimal to
``multimillion-dollar companies like Bar/Bri who have been avoiding
their responsibility for years.'' She said that law schools have been
providing sign language interpreters and other special services since
a 1977 federal disability act went into effect.
</P>
<P>
``When they got out of law school and went for the bar exam review,
they'd say, ``Hey, where's my interpreter? Where's my simultaneous
transcriber?' '' Mayerson said.
</P>
<P>
Under the consent decree, Bar/Bri also agreed to educate its staff
about the needs of disabled students and include information about
auxiliary aids and services in its advertising.

 Colleges Lobby Hard for Superstar Commencement Speakers (Long Beach) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONG BEACH, Calif.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They wanted a role model, a teacher, a
motivator of young people to issue the final rousing challenge to the
class of '94 at California State University, Long Beach. And there he
was at the podium Friday morning, an unlikely sight in black robes and
mortar board instead of Dodger blue -- Tommy Lasorda.
</P>
<P>
Mills College in Oakland, Calif., wasn't as lucky filling its
commencement marquee. After rejection by Oprah, Whoopi and
Chilean-born author Isabel Allende, the all-female school settled for
Alice Waters, the owner of Chez Panisse restaurant in nearby Berkeley.
She used the occasion Sunday to warn about the hazards of fast food.
</P>
<P>
``She was available and that's how we settled on her,'' said Sharon
Jones, executive director of college relations at Mills.
</P>
<P>
With more than 3,500 schools hunting graduation speakers this year,
administrators must stalk eye-catching names for months and put the
grip on influential alums to avoid stifled yawns and even
embarrassment at commencement time.
</P>
<P>
Lasorda was the first choice for Long Beach's College of the Arts
even though the longtime manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers and
diet-drink pitchman never attended college. His strongest higher
education credential is an honorary membership in the Valparaiso
University alumni association, but that was of no concern.
</P>
<P>
The idea, was to sprinkle a little Dodger glory on the program and
make the point that sometimes art imitates baseball. ``It's very
difficult to get into the major leagues and it's very difficult to get
into a Spielberg film,'' said Howard V. Burman, chairman of the
theater arts department.
</P>
<P>
In what may be the only graduation covered by ESPN, the professor
of the clubhouse talked about what it takes to succeed in life (nope,
it's not a split-finger fastball). According to Jay San-Martin, the
student body president, Lasorda's anecdotes and banquet-circuit wisdom
was a hit with the 600 aspiring Pacinos, Baryshnikovs and Van
Cliburns.
</P>
<P>
``Students have been flailed, for lack of a better word, in the
past by speakers, who although intelligent or renown in their field,
have not necessarily had a good connection with the student class,''
said San-Martin, whose position has required him to sit through seven
commencement addresses so far this year. ``Tommy has the ability to
make that connection and he did today.''
</P>
<P>
In 1947, George Marshall elevated the standards for commencement
speeches when he chose Harvard University's graduation exercises to
reveal his plan for redeeming postwar Europe.
</P>
<P>
For the most part, however, college officials say they are just
happy to find speakers that bridge the gap between the profound and
the popular. The problem is that the small circle of instantly
recognizable people who can do that -- President Clinton, his wife
Hillary Rodham Clinton, actors such as Edward James Olmos -- are too
busy to honor all but a few invitations.
</P>
<P>
High-demand speakers such as poet Maya Angelou, who charges
$20,000, are too expensive for schools with paltry budgets or only
honorary degrees to offer.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Some Stanford seniors complained because President Gerhard Casper
invited a former alum and distinguished Yale law professor, Stephen
Carter, to speak at the June ceremony, instead of Angelou, author
Scott Turow or David Letterman. A student newspaper editorial lamented
that the Palo Alto, Calif., school could not attract a heavyweight for
the graduation of its 100th class.
</P>
<P>
In a bizarre twist, University of Southern California's graduation
program May 6 did not list an official commencement speaker. The
reason: Two of its honorary degree recipients, producers Steven
Spielberg and George Lucas, asked not to be billed as commencement
speakers, although they offered limited remarks, a school spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
In the game of lining up speakers, the Milwaukee School of
Engineering claimed a minor public relations coup in February when it
induced actor James Doohan, who played ``Scotty'' on the original
``Star Trek,'' to give the winter commencement address. Doohan was
invited and given an honorary degree, school officials said, because
he had inspired a generation of Trekkers to study engineering.
</P>
<P>
Fortune and luck shined on Whittier (Calif.) College , however -- a
personal plea from its president during a London trip a year ago led
to Friday's extemporaneous commencement address from Anglican
Archbishop Trevor Huddleston, an anti-apartheid activist who stood at
Nelson Mandela's side during the recent South African presidential
inauguration.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
A commencement address is important because it helps defines both
school and student, said Harvard education professor Arthur Levine.
The college lays bare its institutional values by selecting a speaker
and the speech itself becomes the ``last lesson'' for students heading
into the cruel world, he said.
</P>
<P>
Most important, though, the show must go on. Some college officials
find themselves resorting to old-fashioned networking, cajoling and
persistence to snare a name commencement speaker. At Mills, for
instance, administrators went to work months ago to sign-up any one of
the candidates forwarded for consideration by the senior class.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
The list included Texas newspaper columnist Molly Ivins, talk show
host Oprah Winfrey, actresses Whoopi Goldberg or Emma Thompson,
California State Treasurer Kathleen Brown, authors Ursula K. Le Guin
and Sandra Cisneros, and restaurateur Waters.
</P>
<P>
Jones, the Mills administrator, said calls to Winfrey's Chicago
production company revealed she was ``getting married and didn't want
to do anything more than concentrate on that.''
</P>
<P>
Jones then tried to reach Goldberg, whose hometown is in nearby
Berkeley. ``I actually knew Whoopi's mother and someone else knew
where Whoopi's mother shopped, they knew the neighborhood in which
Whoopi's mother lived and the church she attended,'' said Jones.
</P>
<P>
But when Goldberg's mother volunteered the phone number for
Goldberg's agent, the college learned that the star was busy filming
three movies at once. Mills officials faxed a December letter to
Allende, who lives in nearby Marin County, only to find out she was on
a tour promoting three new books.
</P>
<P>
With time running out, Mills officials called Waters, a celebrated
organic food environmentalist who made headlines when she once tried
to break Clinton of the hamburger habit.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
At Long Beach, Dean Wade Hobgood said Lasorda was a unanimous
choice. ``There were a half of dozen names mentioned and Tommy's name
rose to the surface,'' Hobgood said about a meeting with his
department chairmen earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Hobgood said college administrators singled out Lasorda, in part,
because his daughter had graduated from the dance program in 1977. In
addition, the chairman of the theater arts department had earned favor
with team management with his play ``Boys of Summer,'' a musical about
the old Brooklyn Dodgers that is now headed for off-Broadway.
</P>
<P>
A Dodgers official said Lasorda readily agreed to speak, because
the team was scheduled for a day off. But Burman, who is also a Dodger
season ticket holder, said he sealed the deal by going to an early
morning batting practice and making the commencement pitch personally
to Lasorda.
</P>
<P>
Using anecdotes about determination, Lasorda never mentioned the
word ``art'' in his talk but in something of a locker room speech, he
exhorted graduates to persevere and ``outwork your competitor.''
</P>
<P>
``You are going to face a lot of challenges, you are going to be in
a world that if you are not fully prepared, like many, you will fall
by the way side,'' he said. ``But what you have learned here in this
beautiful, wonderful university will carry you through for the rest of
your life.''

 Top Aides to Pay for Golf Flight (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thirteen senior White House officials Friday
volunteered to chip in to help a fired senior aide repay the
government the cost of his helicopter trip to play golf near Camp
David, and the White House acknowledged that a second helicopter took
part in the outing.
</P>
<P>
In his resignation letter released Friday, the aide, David Watkins,
was unrepentant. ``I firmly believe that my actions were in
fulfillment of the responsibilities of my position,'' said Watkins,
who was head of the White House Office of Administration.
</P>
<P>
Watkins, a longtime Arkansas friend of President Clinton and First
Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, said ``there simply was no effort on my
part to use White House or military equipment for personal or
recreational purposes'' and that his ``sole motivation was determining
how you could utilize Camp David more frequently.''
</P>
<P>
The president told Watkins in a response that ``I understand your
reasons'' for resigning and thanked Watkins for his ``accomplishments
large and small'' at the White House and for his ``loyal friendship.''
</P>
<P>
In a separate letter, White House Chief of Staff Thomas F. ``Mack''
McLarty, who is among those contributing to repay the cost of the
helicopters, called Watkins's decision to take the flight to play golf
``an unfortunate error.'' Watkins, who left the White House Friday,
was reprimanded last year for his role in the firing of White House
travel office staff members.
</P>
<P>
The aides contributing to the repayment fund included nearly the
entire senior White House hierarchy, including the two deputy chiefs
of staff, Philip Lader and Harold Ickes, special counsel Lloyd N.
Cutler, senior advisers George Stephanopoulos and David R. Gergen and
communications director Mark Gearan.
</P>
<P>
Clinton on Thursday said he was ``very upset'' -- one White House
official described him as ``furious'' -- when he learned that Watkins
and Alphonso Maldon Jr., director of the White House Military Office,
had taken one of the presidential helicopters to New Market, Md.,
Tuesday afternoon for the golf outing. The president promised that the
cost to taxpayers would be repaid.
</P>
<P>
One White House source said the idea of having White House staffers
contribute to the repayment fund arose when Watkins balked at paying
the full amount. An advertising executive in Little Rock, Ark., before
joining the White House staff, Watkins is worth more than $1 million,
according to his financial disclosure statement.
</P>
<P>
Gearan described the repayment effort as a ``gesture of friendship
to Mr. Watkins and Mr. Maldon.'' Another official said that only
Watkins is contributing to defray the cost, but could not provide any
dollar amount. Maldon is being reassigned elsewhere in the
administration and was not asked to repay the costs because he was
acting at Watkins's direction, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the decision of senior staffers to help out Watkins
suggests that his action is not taken seriously, Gearan said, ``That
would be a misread of the situation.'' Rather, he said: ``We accept
that he acted in good faith but recognize there was an error and he
has resigned. . . . His colleagues are being supportive.''
</P>
<P>
The White House could not provide an estimate for the cost of the
flights, but the military estimates the cost at $2,380 for each hour
of flight time. The helicopter that carried Watkins and Maldon, flew
for about 30 minutes to Camp David in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains
and then 15 minutes to the golf course. It then returned to Washington
and flew back to the golf course to pick up the pair at the end of
their round, meaning flight time of more than two hours.
</P>
<P>
The White House said the military also would be reimbursed for the
cost of a second helicopter, but said it could provide no information
on the second craft's flight time. Gearan said that helicopter was on
a ``training mission'' but acknowledged that it would ``probably not''
have flown had the first helicopter not been in the air.
</P>
<P>
White House officials initially denied reports of other golfers
that a second helicopter was involved but later Friday acknowledged
that the second one had flown up to Maryland.

 Man Pleads No Contest in Spy Case (San Francisco) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former police officer Tom Gerard, who fled to the
Philippines after he was accused of spying for the Anti-Defamation
League, pleaded no contest Friday to one charge of illegally accessing
police computer records.
</P>
<P>
Gerard's plea brings to a close the spying scandal that rocked the
prominent Jewish civil rights group last year and outraged thousands
of people and activist groups targeted by the league's private
intelligence operation.
</P>
<P>
Gerard, a onetime CIA agent who voluntarily returned from
self-imposed exile to face charges, is the only person to be
prosecuted in the scandal. He will serve 45 days in a work camp and
pay a fine of $2,500.
</P>
<P>
Last fall, San Francisco District Attorney Arlo Smith agreed not to
bring charges against the Anti-Defamation League after the group
promised to pay up to $75,000 to Smith's office to fight hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
Gerard, who at one point was an intelligence officer with the San
Francisco Police Department, was accused of tapping into police
computers and giving confidential information on hundreds of people to
Roy Bullock, an undercover operative for the ADL.
</P>
<P>
Bullock has admitted that the two of them sold some of the
information to an agent for the South African government. Bullock, who
was never charged, also used data from Gerard in amassing intelligence
files for the ADL on nearly 10,000 people and 950 groups, ranging from
the Klu Klux Klan to the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
After the FBI began investigating the case, Gerard fled to the
Philippines and resigned from the force. He left behind a briefcase
filled with such items as false IDs, information about Central
American death squads and a black executioner-style hood. From the
Philippines, he threatened to expose illegal CIA support of death
squads if he was prosecuted for his role in the ADL case.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a San Francisco judge dismissed felony charges against
Gerard after the FBI refused to provide wiretaps and investigative
files in the case. Because the issue could have been tied up on appeal
for years, both sides agreed to the misdemeanor plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the theft of confidential data in the future, Smith
said, the San Francisco Police Department will require all computer
users to have a personal password.

 Hitler Uninivited to D-Day Anniversary Celebration (Southgate) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SOUTHGATE, Calif.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eisenhower, Churchill and their troops were
pursuing him 50 years ago. But they gave up the hunt for Hitler on
Friday in South Gate.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of an 800-member veterans group planning to have an Adolf
Hitler look-a-like take a mock drubbing from Gen. Dwight Eisenhower
and Prime Minister Winston Churchill impersonators at a D-Day
anniversary celebration say the enemy is no longer invited.
</P>
<P>
``We couldn't find a decent Hitler,'' said Bob Stane, president of
the B-17 Combat Crewmen Wingmen's Association, which is
co-sponsoring the event at the South Gate Post Office.
</P>
<P>
``But then, there never was a decent Hitler.''
</P>
<P>
The veterans said they plan now to hunt instead for Gen. George
Patton and President Roosevelt look-a-likes who can give the event a
more festive look.
</P>
<P>
The uninviting of the enemy is probably just as well, considering
the dimensions the D-Day gathering was taking Friday.
</P>
<P>
What began two months ago as an informal commemorative
stamp-canceling ceremony for veterans at the post office has
mushroomed into a celebration that is now attracting local, state and
federal officials, a marching band, an ROTC drill team and military
color guards from the four branches of the military.
</P>
<P>
``We're honoring WWII veterans, so why not do something splashy?''
said South Gate Postmaster Prescilla Buckley, who has ordered a tent
and folding chairs and convinced the local Rotary Club to bring
refreshments for hundreds.
</P>
<P>
Veterans who actually hit the beaches during the June 6 invasion of
Europe are being invited to autograph commemorative cachets postmarked
with a special ``D-Day June 6 1944-1994 50th Anniversary''
cancellation stamp and tell war stories, she said.
</P>
<P>
The absence of Hitler probably won't bother the Sir Winston
Churchill impersonator that the veterans have invited. That's because
he's a scowling English bulldog that the veterans say may be kept busy
licking stamps during the celebration.
</P>
<P>
Dog owner Diane Wuertemburg said her bulldog -- whose real name is
Archie -- may show up wearing a miniature English bowler hat for the
occasion.
</P>
<P>
But Eisenhower look-a-like Robert Beer may be disappointed. He is a
civil engineer who tried to enlist during WWII but was assigned
instead by the government to ride herd on the production of U.S.
warplanes at Lockheed and Hughes aircraft plants.
</P>
<P>
Beer said he learned he was a dead-ringer for Ike in 1943 when
Eisenhower was named supreme commander of Allied troops fighting
Hitler's Nazi forces. ``The day he was appointed I came to work and a
newspaper with his picture in it was on my desk and I thought it was
me,'' Beer said.

 The U.N. Must Abandon Its New Military Role 
 Clough is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last Wednesday, United Nations Secretary General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali denounced the international community for not sending
troops to end the fighting in Rwanda, where an estimated 200,000
people have died. He was right to condemn world leaders for their
inaction, but wrong to believe that a U.N. peacekeeping force is -- or
was -- the answer. Quite the contrary. The efforts of Boutros-Ghali and
others to expand the military role of the United Nations are partly to
blame for the failure of the international community to develop
effective ways to prevent such violent conflicts as is in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The root cause of the problem is the belief that the end of the
Cold War opens the door for the United Nations to take on ever more
responsibility for international peace and security. This ambition is
an article of faith among a small but outspoken group of
internationalists who regard the U.N. Charter as a sacred text that
was regularly defiled by superpower antics during the Cold War. It was
also fostered by world leaders, especially by former President George
Bush, who see the world body as a convenient way to conceal unilateral
desires beneath a cloak of international legitimacy (as happened in
the case of the Persian Gulf War) and to shift responsibility for
troublesome conflicts in nonstrategic places to others (as happened in
the case of Angola). Finally, the new role was embraced by many relief
and human-rights organizations that saw it as a means to transform the
body into a vehicle for humanitarian intervention.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the results of U.N. military adventures have been
disastrous. The Bush administration's cynical manipulation of the
Security Council during the Gulf conflict has greatly increased
distrust of the United Nations in many Third World countries. The
misguided humanitarian intervention in Somalia has created a general
reluctance to get involved in other conflicts. The U.N.'s role in
military decisions regarding Bosnia has complicated and endangered the
organization's humanitarian operations there and weakened the
credibility of NATO threats to deter Serbian aggression. Now,
disagreements over U.N. military-deployment plans and a lack of troop
commitments have become an excuse for inaction in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts contend these problems can be solved by a series of
reforms, among them, adding new permanent members to the Security
Council; strengthening the U.N. Secretariat's ability to plan and
supervise military operations; creating a standing U.N. military
force, and establishing criteria for humanitarian intervention under
Chapter Seven of the U.N. Charter, which authorizes military action in
response to threats to international peace and security. This is
wishful thinking. Few of these reforms are likely to be approved by
the U.N. membership. Even if they were, it is doubtful that they would
produce the outcome their proponents covet.
</P>
<P>
The effective use of force requires a degree of consensus and
resolve that the Security Council can only muster in extreme
circumstances. The Gulf War and intervention in Somalia were the
exceptions that proved the rule. In both instances, without American
leadership, the United Nations would not have acted -- or been able to
act -- in the ways it did. None of the reforms now being recommended
would change this reality.
</P>
<P>
But even if a significant U.N. military capability could be
created, it would be a mistake to move down this path. If an attempt
were made to use such a force to stop the fighting in Rwanda, or
Angola, or any of the other civil wars now raging, it would risk
involving the United Nations in protracted guerrilla wars. To believe
otherwise would require a naive faith that the parties to these
conflicts would be prepared to give up their objectives and bow to
U.N. demands without a fight. At the same time, it would be equally
naive to believe that a U.N. force would have any more success in
ending civil wars than the United States had in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Just as important, military intervention would make it impossible
for U.N. officials to maintain the impartiality that is usually
essential to the success of diplomatic mediation efforts and
humanitarian-relief operations. These are the areas where the United
Nations has achieved most of its greatest successes. As we have seen
in Bosnia, however, once the Security Council approves military
actions, U.N. mediators and relief workers lose the shield of
neutrality.
</P>
<P>
What can be done? The Clinton administration has taken a series of
steps in the right direction. A presidential directive earlier this
month establishes criteria that will greatly restrict the kinds of
peacekeeping operations Washington will support. One result is that
the administration has been reluctant to back deployment of soldiers
in Rwanda. But it has not gone far enough.
</P>
<P>
Over the long run, the only kind of policy that is likely to
succeed is one that combines a blanket prohibition against U.N.
military intervention in combat situations with serious efforts to
bolster the nonmilitary operations of the United Nations to head off
violent conflict and alleviate human suffering.
</P>
<P>
It may be necessary for the United States and other countries to
intervene for humanitarian reasons in conflicts such as Rwanda. And,
over time, it may be possible for regional organizations to develop
the military capabilities and decision-making structures needed for
intervention. But these interventions are likely to be far more timely
and successful if the United Nations is not involved. For example, the
only opportunity to stop the violence in Rwanda through armed action
was probably in the first hours after Rwandan government forces began
to slaughter their opponents in Kigali. If the United States, France
and Belgium had been willing to send troops in then, they probably
could have prevented the killing from reaching such horrific
proportions. Waiting for Security Council authorization would scuttle
any such undertaking. As it is, the idea that such interventions are a
U.N. responsibility provides a convenient rationale for Washington and
other powers to stay on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
Rather than decry the international community's failure to support
his calls for military action in Rwanda, Boutros-Ghali should direct
his attention to developing ways to prevent future Rwandas. One would
be to push for the creation of an international criminal court that
would be responsible for investigating crimes against humanity and
gross human-rights violations. If such a court were created and its
decisions accepted and enforced by the world's governments, it would
provide a significant deterrent against the kinds of atrocities
occurring in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Boutros-Ghali should take the lead in calling on
the United Nations and all other international organizations to bar
any government that comes to power through violence or commits gross
human-rights abuses from receiving international assistance. Finally,
he should devote greater effort to getting the international community
to focus on the deteriorating situation in countries like Kenya and
Zaire, which are already sliding down the same slippery slope that led
to hundreds of thousands of deaths in Rwanda and Somalia.

These measures will not produce quick results, nor will they end
the fighting in Rwanda. But they would help to create the kind of
political environment that will discourage future slaughters and make
military intervention unnecessary. By contrast, another quixotic U.N.
military operation would only set the stage for more disasters.

 Pact Announced on Va. Pension Tax 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Virginia legislative leaders and representatives of
federal retirees have reached a tentative $340 million settlement for
the thousands of pensioners whom the state illegally taxed in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
The pact would pay 80 percent of claims, excluding interest, in
installments over five years. It would cost $106 million more than an
offer by Gov. George Allen that was resoundingly rejected this month
by retirees and the General Assembly, but $60 million less than a
recent proposal by the plaintiffs' attorney, Michael J. Kator.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the deal, which would end five years of litigation,
was signed Wednesday night by retiree representatives and House
Majority Leader C. Richard Cranwell. Cranwell had continued
negotiations while Allen's proposal was failing. The proposed pact was
first reported in the Washington Times.
</P>
<P>
Democratic and Republican legislative leaders and Attorney General
James S. Gilmore III (R) were briefed on the settlement Thursday in
Richmond; some said they wanted to study it, but no one opposed it
strongly, sources said. The same day, Gilmore asked a federal judge to
postpone a hearing next Thursday on a retiree lawsuit seeking back
taxes, citing progress toward a settlement.
</P>
<P>
A news conference is planned Tuesday to announce all the details of
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for Gilmore and Allen said both had concerns about the
proposed settlement. The governor, for example, wants to make sure
it's not paid for with ``phantom funds,'' press secretary Ken Stroupe
said yesterday. But Gilmore's spokesman, Mark Miner, said,
``Significant progress has occurred. . . . We're trying to get it
cleared up as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
The deal hinges on approval by 80 percent of the several hundred
retirees who have sued for tax refunds, followed by General Assembly
ratification. According to the agreement, the 186,000 retirees who
qualify would have six months to file claims.
</P>
<P>
Some lawmakers are concerned that the proposal could run into stiff
opposition from pensioners who have vowed to press for 100 percent
refunds and interest.
</P>
<P>
``I think the legislature will go for it,'' said one lawmaker who
was close to the negotiations. ``It's the retirees-they're the ones
who could torpedo it.''
</P>
<P>
But Rose Musumeci, president of the Virginia chapter of the
National Association of Retired Federal Employees, said that if the
settlement is equal to what has been reported, she believes it will
fly. ``You're not going to satisfy everybody,'' she said yesterday,
but ``I think 80 percent of the retirees would go along with it.'' The
pact would set up a special fund paid with general fund appropriations
 -- $60 million the first year and $70 million in the following years.
It would end a fight that began in 1989 when the U.S. Supreme Court
ruled that Virginia and other states could not tax federal retirees'
pensions unless they also taxed those of local and state government
employees

 Endgame on China Policy Began at Nixon's Funeral (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The endgame between the United States and China, which
climaxed Thursday with President Clinton's decision to extend China's
trading privileges, began at Richard M. Nixon's funeral in late April
when top administration officials organized a last-ditch effort to
persuade China to improve its human rights record.
</P>
<P>
In a little room inside the Nixon Library, national security
adviser Anthony Lake, National Economic Council head Robert E. Rubin
and Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord met with Chinese
Ambassador Li Daoyu to discuss ways China could make further progress
in human rights. The U.S. officials offered to send a special envoy to
Beijing to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
It is far from clear whether anyone in the room considered China's
response would make much difference. At that late date, no American
official believed disrupting trade with China would be wise, even
though Beijing was unlikely to meet the conditions laid down by
Clinton last year for renewal of its preferred trade status. U.S.
intelligence analysts were reporting from the beginning that the
Chinese never believed Clinton's threat to pull the plug on the
lucrative U.S.-Chinese commerce.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the administration's offer to send a special envoy
reflected its need to make renewal of trade benefits more palatable
politically, and China's inclination to accept reflected perhaps its
willingness to let Clinton save a little face.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the final days of Clinton's threat to withdraw China's
most-favored-nation (MFN) trading status were an exercise in preparing
for the inevitable. Administration officials not only had to squeeze
the Chinese for any last drops of concession -- a released prisoner
here, a discussion of radio jamming there. They also had to convince
members of Congress and the public that Clinton's decision was not
another example of foreign policy waffling, this one involving the
most populous country in the world.
</P>
<P>
In that sense, the saga is as much a story of politics in
Washington as it is of human rights in China.
</P>
<P>
Friday, administration officials were describing as heroic
Clinton's decision to extend MFN for China despite insufficient
progress on human rights and to separate in the future the issues of
trade and human rights. Madeleine K. Albright, the U.S. ambassador to
the United Nations, called it ``a very important step in showing
American resolve.''
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Warren Christopher said a policy of
``comprehensive engagement'' with China had replaced the trade threat
as the focus of U.S. policy, calling the new approach ``the best way
to influence China's development.'' As in other administration foreign
policy dramas, even those who agreed with the outcome despaired at the
process. ``We have seen one great power try to bluff another and seen
the bluff called,'' said Douglas Paal, a China analyst and proponent
of delinking trade matters from human rights concerns. ``It's not a
pretty sight, and it may be damaging.''
</P>
<P>
The Yorba Linda meeting had been designed to head off that kind of
perception, but in the end, China gave less than administration
officials had hoped.
</P>
<P>
The offer to send a secret envoy resulted in the mission to Beijing
in early May of Michael Armacost, a veteran diplomat. Armacost was
publicly opposed to revocation of China's MFN status, but after some
persuading from Christopher, he embarked for China on May 8.
</P>
<P>
He won some concessions: pledges to release from jail at least two
prominent dissidents, including pro-democracy activists Chen Zeming
and Wang Juntao. The Chinese also invited an American technical team
to discuss the jamming of Voice of America, gave Armacost a list of
some prisoners, permitted the emigration of some citizens whose
passports had been blocked for political reasons and agreed to
inspection of a prison labor camp suspected of producing goods for
export to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Armacost returned to the United States May 12 advising Clinton to
pocket his limited winnings, extend MFN and move on.
</P>
<P>
During roughly the same period, the administration recruited
numerous visitors to China to press for more progress on human rights.
Among them were Jimmy Carter's former national security adviser
Zbigniew Brzezinski, Nixon's former chief foreign policy adviser Henry
Kissinger and China expert Michael Oksenberg. All were briefed by
security adviser Lake and/or Christopher and all were urged to ask for
more progress.
</P>
<P>
The idea for the Armacost mission had been discussed at an April 8
meeting of Clinton's top foreign policy advisers. Vice President Gore
mentioned the idea to visiting Chinese State Counselor Song Jiang that
day.
</P>
<P>
High-profile diplomacy had produced mixed results. In late March,
Christopher had returned from Beijing with some pledges of
cooperation, but these were overshadowed by arrests of Chinese
dissidents and hard-line public statements by the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Christopher was constrained in responding in an equally tough
fashion. To do so would risk a confrontation that would all but tie
Clinton's hands, disrupt trade and probably the whole relationship
with China, State Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
In any event, Armacost's secret diplomacy was also disappointing.
Christopher, whose assignment it was to report to Clinton on China's
progress on human rights, declined to give it a clean bill of health.
</P>
<P>
He made a key judgment that China had complied with two compulsory
criteria for maintaining its low tariff trade status: progress in
emigration and inspections of prison labor camps to search for goods
bound for U.S. export.
</P>
<P>
He recommended a ban on imports of Chinese munitions to indicate
displeasure with the lack of progress on issues such as repression in
Tibet and continued detentions of democracy activists. At one point in
the past week, Clinton suggested that no sanctions should be applied;
it would muddle the message that trade and human rights were being
separated. Christopher and others argued that some sanction was
necessary.
</P>
<P>
Proposals for either an American or a joint Chinese-American human
rights commission also were shot down this week as unworkable. Carter,
whom Clinton tried to recruit to head the commission, persuaded the
president to drop the idea. On May 19, Rubin, Lake and other officials
met with Carter at National Airport; Carter them met with Ambassador
Lito push the human rights message, a last stab at back-channel
diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's original threat was expressly designed to unite the
presidency and Congress behind a single policy. Congress, led by
Democrats, had repeatedly tried to legislate economic sanctions
against China, which President George Bush repeatedly vetoed. Clinton
roundly criticized Bush and said he would be tougher.
</P>
<P>
The political consensus was sacrificed with Clinton's retreat.
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, and Rep. Nancy
Pelosi, D-Calif., criticized Clinton's decision and threatened to
legislate sanctions on Chinese imports. If successful, they would put
Clinton in the position of having to veto the measure, just as Bush
did.
</P>
<P>
Administration officials are counting on Democrats not to embarrass
Clinton over the issue. One Democratic staff member in the House,
musing on the inability of Clinton to win major concessions from the
Chinese, said wryly, ``It turned out that MFN was useful as a tool
only to bludgeon George Bush.''

 Unions Support Lifting of Oil Export Ban 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five key U.S. maritime unions formally agreed Friday to support
lifting a federal ban on the export of Alaskan crude oil, in a deal
worked out with British Petroleum Co.
</P>
<P>
Breaking its silence at the same time, BP confirmed that it has
agreed to preserve union jobs by using U.S.-flag tankers to ship any
BP oil ``that moves off the Alaskan North Slope,'' said Rob Rehg, a
spokesman for the London-based oil company.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is contingent on Congress adding the lifting of the
ban to a pending bill that would extend the Export Administration Act.
Though opposition remains among members of Congress, proponents were
optimistic on Friday.
</P>
<P>
``It doesn't make it a done deal, but it certainly makes it a
viable deal,'' said one congressional source. ``If the maritime unions
really get behind this, they can sway a lot of Congress members. ...
And then if you get a good (U.S. Department of Energy) study that says
it's not going to affect national energy concerns, then there's no
legitimate argunment for the ban.''
</P>
<P>
A still-unreleased Energy Department report on the costs and
benefits of lifting the ban estimates that as many as 494
maritime-industry jobs could be lost in 1994-'95 if the ban were ended
without a provision requiring the crude to be transported on U.S.-flag
ships.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the study supports proponents' estimates that thousands
of new oilfield jobs -- and a substantial increase in investment in
California and Alaskan production -- would result from lifting the ban.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Though many high-ranking members of the Clinton administration
favor lifting the ban, the White House is not likely to take a formal
stand on the issue until after the release of the DOE report, expected
June 7.
</P>
<P>
In a statement made available to the Los Angeles Times Friday,
executives of the Seafarers International Union; National Maritime
Union; American Maritime Officers; International Organization of
Masters, Mates Pilots; and Marine Engineers Beneficial Association
ended two decades of insistence on preserving the ban, declared that
lifting it will create jobs and ensure the existence of a U.S. tanker
fleet -- ``vessels that are militarily useful in times of conflict.''
</P>
<P>
California's independent oil producers and other proponents of
lifting the ban have argued that it forces too much crude into the
California market, depressing the regional price.

 White House Aides to Help Pay Cost of Helicopter Trip (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
White House anger over an aide's golf outing by
helicopter seemed to cool rapidly Friday, as top aides agreed to help
the fired administrative chief reimburse the government for the cost
of his ride.
</P>
<P>
As a ``gesture of friendship,'' 13 top White House officials -- 
virtually the entire senior rank -- committed to help the former chief
of administration pick up a tab, said Mark Gearan, the director of
communications. By one rough estimate that bill could run to about
$20,000.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came as White House efforts to defuse a public
relations debacle were set back by their admission that a second
Marine helicopter also had gone on the outing that took David Watkins
and two others to an afternoon of golf Tuesday at the Holly Hill
Country Club in Frederick, Md.
</P>
<P>
After denying earlier that any other helicopters were part of the
trip, Gearan conceded that there was a second helicopter. While the
second aircraft's purpose was to conduct a ``training mission,'' he
said it would ``probably not'' have been along but for Watkins' plans
to spend the afternoon at the course.
</P>
<P>
The disclosure of the trip Thursday prompted President Clinton to
seek Watkins' resignation. Clinton declared that he was ``very angry''
at news about his long-time Arkansas friend and business associate and
promised that private money would be used to reimburse the government
for the trip.
</P>
<P>
But announcement of plans for the White House contributions
appeared to add a dose of moral ambiguity to the episode, forcing
officials to deny that the top aides were not taking the infraction
seriously.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
The trip reawakened voter outrage on radio and television talk
shows across the country. But at the White House, anger was barely
evident in a series of letters, released late in the day, from
Clinton, Watkins and Thomas F. ``Mack'' McLarty, the White House chief
of staff.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made only the most passing reference to the reason for
Watkins' departure, saying: ``I write to accept your resignation and
to say that I understand your reasons for submitting it.''
</P>
<P>
He praised Watkins' ``great vigor and effectiveness'' and thanked
him for improvement in the White House telephone and computer systems.
``Hillary and I will never forget the loyal friendship you and Ileene
(Watkins' wife) have given to us over the years.''
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
For his part, the 52-year-old Watkins insisted that ``there simply
was no effort on my part to use the White House or military equipment
for personal or recreational purposes. My sole purpose was determining
how you could utilize Camp David more frequently and enjoy the same
opportunity for relaxation in Maryland that you sometimes get in
Washington.''
</P>
<P>
The aides who have agreed to contribute are McLarty, presidential
advisers David Gergen and George Stephanopoulos, Gearan, deputy chiefs
of staff Phillip Lader and Harold M. Ickes, economic adviser Robert E.
Rubin, counsel Lloyd N. Cutler, national service director Eli Segal,
congressional relations director Pat Griffin, cabinet secretary
Christine Varney, public liaison chief Alexis Herman and domestic
policy director Carol Rasco. Gearan said that it was unclear whether
the Clintons would contribute.
</P>
<P>
Officials are awaiting word from the Pentagon on the size of the
total bill for the use of the helicopters, which cost $2,380 an hour
to operate. Gearan said it was undecided how the cost would be shared
but said it is certain that Watkins and Alphonso Maldon, the White
House military-office head who joined Watkins for the outing, will
``be paying something.''
</P>
<P>
A third golfer, Navy Cmdr. Richard Cellon, who directs operations
at Camp David, was judged to have no responsibility for the trip and
will not pay anything. The positions of Watkins and Maldon give them
authority over Cellon.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Gearan said that the Marine helicopter had taken Watkins and Maldon
from Bolling Air Force Base near Washington to Camp David, where
Watkins took part in a meeting that lasted about 30 minutes and
conducted a ``site inspection'' of new construction. Then the
helicopter dropped the three at Holly Hill and headed back to the air
base.
</P>
<P>
Two other golfers at the course said that they saw the second
aircraft join Watkins' aircraft after the golfers had been picked up,
though Gearan indicated that the two helicopters did not fly together
on the return trip.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Gearan was asked why reporters earlier had been told that the trip
was devoted to scout out a potential golfing site for the president.
``That was the best information received at the time from David and Al
Maldon,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Although Clinton showed a flash of anger during a press conference
Thursday afternoon, one aide said that he had not expresssed anger to
Watkins.
</P>
<P>
Clinton had talked to Watkins on the telephone before the press
conference and met with him for about 15 minutes afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Former Republican aides noted pointedly that in the George Bush and
Ronald Reagan administrations only presidents used the helicopters.
This was both because of the cost of operation and because the copters
were viewed as part of the ceremonial trappings that should be
reserved for the chief executive.

 Pearl Jam Complains Ticketmaster Pressured Promoters to Boycott Band 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a memorandum to the U.S. Justice Department, the rock band Pearl
Jam has complained that Los Angeles-based Ticketmaster successfully
pressured promoters to boycott the band's low-cost concert tour this
summer.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the Seattle-based band -- the biggest selling rock group
in the country -- made the complaint on May 6 in a memo to the
department's antitrust division. The memo accused Ticketmaster -- the
world's largest ticket agency -- of exercising a monopoly over ticket
distribution in this country and using that influence to keep
promoters from booking the Pearl Jam tour.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum, filed by Sullivan Cromwell, a prominent New York
law firm, said Ticketmaster has exclusive arrangements with all
important concert venues in the country and uses these arrangements to
``cement control over the distribution of tickets to concerts.''
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department has begun an evaluation of the memo, and
sent three officials from Washington to Los Angeles on Tuesday to
interview music business figures, sources said.
</P>
<P>
Such an evaluation is in some measure a standard response to such a
complaint. It is preliminary to a decision on whether to launch an
investigation.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Justice Department declined comment.
Representatives for Pearl Jam also did not comment.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Los Angeles Times, Ticketmaster vice president
Ned S. Goldstein said ``Ticketmaster operates fully and squarely
within the parameters of all applicable laws.''
</P>
<P>
Sales of Pearl Jam's last two albums together exceeded $137
million. Ticketmaster, which is privately held, last year reportedly
earned about $200 million in service and sponsorship fees on $1.3
billion in sales of tickets to concert and sporting events.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
The Pearl Jam memorandum is likely to focus new attention on a
growing furor over skyrocketing concert ticket prices and service
fees, and the arrangements among managers, promoters and service
companies that underlie pricing decisions.
</P>
<P>
Ticketmaster collects a phone service fee for tickets to rock and
pop concerts, typically $6 to $8 per ticket, although the agency's fee
for $350 tickets for Barbra Streisand shows amounted to $18 in some
cities. Ticketmaster pays a portion of the fees to maintain exclusive
long-term contracts with the owners of the largest concert venues. In
addition, Ticketmaster also pays a portion to some promoters,
managers, agents and artists.
</P>
<P>
In March, Pearl Jam sent letters to promoters vowing to perform
concerts this summer only at venues that charged $18 for a ticket and
no more than $1.80 for service or handling charges. A representative
of the band said Pearl Jam was seeking to keep prices in the range of
their young fans.
</P>
<P>
But sources in the concert industry said the group encountered
immediate resistance from Ticketmaster and members of the North
American Concert Promoters Association, a McLean, Va.-based group that
represents the nation's largest promoters.
</P>
<P>
In two letters obtained by The Times, Ben Liss, the executive
director of the association, warned promoters that if they booked
Pearl Jam under the band's conditions, they could face possible
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
Ticketmaster ``views the Pearl Jam issue as an all or nothing
proposition,'' Liss wrote in one of his letters on March 24.
Ticketmaster chief executive Fred Rosen ``has indicated that he
intends to take a very strong stand on this issue to protect
Ticketmaster's existing contracts with promoters and facilities and,
further, (Ticketmaster) will use all available remedies to protect
itself from outside third parties that attempt to interfere with those
existing contracts.''
</P>
<P>
Liss did not return phone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
After being turned down by virtually every major promoter in the
country for bookings, Pearl Jam postponed its summer tour.

 Clinton Says He Does Not Plan to Fire Christopher or Lake (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Clinton, concerned by a loss of public
confidence in his leadership on foreign policy, said Friday that he
has consulted widely but has rejected recommendations that he replace
Secretary of State Warren Christopher and White House national
security adviser Anthony Lake.
</P>
<P>
Administration officials had told the Los Angeles Times that
Clinton was considering a major shake-up of his foreign policy team by
the end of the year. But Clinton, in a telephone interview late
Friday, said that the root of the problem is communicating his foreign
policy to the American people. And that, he said, is not the
responsibility of Christopher or Lake.
</P>
<P>
The president said that he has talked with ``a huge number'' of
people about his foreign policy problems, perhaps more than 100, and
that he could understand how some of them might have drawn an
inference from the conversations that he planned to change his foreign
policy team.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has come under criticism from some leading Democrats as
well as Republicans for apparent inconsistencies in foreign policy.
Most recently, he was faulted for his decision after weeks of
semipublic deliberations to renew China's most-favored-nation trade
status, despite the Beijing regime's failure to meet human rights
conditions that he had set forth last year.
</P>
<P>
The president conceded Friday that he had made mistakes in the way
he has articulated his foreign policy and that he needs to do a better
job of that. But on most major policy issues, he said, he believes the
administration has been on sound footing.
</P>
<P>
His consultations inside and outside the administration, he said,
was about policy on Bosnia, Haiti and -- most recently -- on China's
trade privileges in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The interview was hastily arranged by White House counselor David
Gergen, who was concerned about comments that other senior
adminstration officials had made to The Times. At times, Clinton
sounded frustrated by what he called the ``relentless criticism'' of
his foreign policy. ``I'm doing the best I can with some fairly
intractable problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Two senior administration officials had said earlier that
Christopher and Lake probably would be replaced by the end of this
year or early in 1995. Several other officials in the State Department
and National Security Council had said that they had no specific
knowledge of plans to replace their bosses but that the expectation
was spreading that either Christopher or Lake -- or both -- would be out
of office by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
``It's a natural response, when you're taking a beating, to think
about what you can change,'' one senior official said. ``The political
people look at the polls and say: `Hey, we'd better do something about
this.' And, since you can't discard the policies that you presumably
are serious about, you shuffle people around instead.''
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Clinton has suffered a series of embarrassing setbacks in foreign
policy from Somalia to Haiti and Bosnia -- problems that, in the public
mind, have overshadowed his claims of success in Russia and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
The president has publicly defended Lake and Christopher when they
have come under fire and aides in their offices said they believed the
president still has confidence in them.
</P>
<P>
Recent polls, however, have shown Americans losing confidence in
the president's management of foreign affairs and Clinton's political
aides are concerned that there may be an impact on his domestic
policies and his reelection chances.
</P>
<P>
Last month a Los Angeles Times poll showed that only 43 percent of
Americans approved of Clinton's handling of foreign affairs. And last
week a Washington Post/ABC News poll showed only 40 percent approved,
his lowest rating since the crisis in Somalia last fall.
</P>
<P>
For months, Christopher and other aides have been pushing for a
shift in emphasis by Clinton, who had sought to focus on domestic
issues and minimize the time he devoted to foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
One official said that as a result of high-level discussions that
has followed the release of some polls, Clinton agreed to devote more
time and personal visibility to foreign policy leadership. An early
reflection of that shift, he said, was Clinton's 90-minute appearance
at a CNN foreign policy ``town meeting'' earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
In the interview Friday, Clinton said that the nation is ``in a
period of transition'' in international relations.
</P>
<P>
``We've got delicate negotiations in the Middle East right now,''
he said. ``The secretary of state is involved in that and China and
the last thing in the world I need to be doing is to be considering
changing my team.
</P>
<P>
``What I need to be doing is considering changing whatever it is
that is not inspiring people's confidence in me and, if we've made
some mistakes, we need to fix it. That's what I'm working on.''
</P>
<P>
If he does ``a better job of communicating our foreign policy,''
Clinton said, Americans will be ``much more understanding of what I'm
trying to do and that will give me the flexibility I need.''

 National:

   CLINTON -- WASHINGTON -- President Clinton, concerned by a loss of
public confidence in his leadership on foreign policy, says that he

security adviser Anthony Lake. 900 words, by Jack Nelson and Doyle
McManus (Times).

   CLINTON-AIDE-TIMES -- Thirteen top White House officials agree to
help David Watkins pick up the tab for his use of a military

 Justice Dept. Seeks Changes to MCI-BT Deal (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Justice Department is trying to negotiate changes
to a British telephone company's plan to buy a $4.3 billion stake in
Washington-based long-distance company MCI Communications Corp.,
government and diplomatic sources said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The move to alter MCI's deal with British Telecommunications PLC,
known as BT, is an apparent reaction to complaints that Britain
unfairly blocks U.S. telecommunications companies from doing certain
kinds of business there.
</P>
<P>
``The negotiations are between BT and the Justice Department,''
said Jonathan Temple, a commercial officer at the British embassy.
``My understanding is, if they come to an agreement with BT, the
Department of Justice will file a consent decree.''
</P>
<P>
A consent decree is a court document under which both parties to a
dispute agree to certain actions. It was unclear Friday what
alterations the department was seeking, or whether the British company
and MCI would agree to them.
</P>
<P>
The talks risk muddying relations between the two governments. On
Thursday, the Justice Department took action against a British glass
company, Pilkington PLC, that it contends uses licensing arrangements
to keep U.S. companies out of foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
Temple said that his country's Department of Trade and Industry
recently wrote the Justice Department to caution against taking any
action that would link approval of the MCI-BT deal to changes in
British regulatory policy.
</P>
<P>
``The government of the United Kingdom is keen to ensure that the
consent decreee, when it emerges, does not impose any second layer of
regulation in addition to that which already exists in the UK,''
Temple said.
</P>
<P>
MCI, BT and Justice Department spokesmen would not comment on the
talks. But an MCI spokesman said that MCI lawyers had visited Justice
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
MCI shareholders have approved the deal, and BT already has handed
over $830 million to MCI. But Justice Department Antitrust Division
chief Anne K. Bingaman and the five-member Federal Communications
Commission also must weigh in before BT puts up the remaining $3.4
billion.
</P>
<P>
With the deal, BT would acquire 20 percent stake in MCI. The
companies would divide their global business, with MCI selling to
corporate long-distance customers in the Western hemisphere and BT to
the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
U.S. law prohibits foreign investors from owning more than 25
percent of U.S. telecommunications companies, on grounds of national
security. But U.S. officials contend that on the whole this market is
more open to foreign competition than is Britain's.
</P>
<P>
Through its review, the Justice Department has leverage to address
longtime complaints here about Britain.
</P>
<P>
In the case of the BT-MCI merger, the Justice Department is
exploring whether other U.S. firms would suffer a competitive
disadvantage because of MCI's presumed superior access to the British
market, Temple said.
</P>
<P>
BT, Britain's largest telephone company, has virtually complete
control over the price of connection charges it imposes on outside
companies wishing to use its local telephone network to route calls in
and out of Britain.
</P>
<P>
The United States also is unhappy with British policies that ban
foreign ownership of international calling facilites. AT T Corp. has
been trying to set up its own such network in Britain. The U.S.
concedes that many barriers to foreign competition in Britain have
come down in the past decade, making it the most open market in
Europe. Long-distance company Sprint Corp. and several regional Bell
companies have received permission or are already offering cable,
wireless and telephone services in the United Kingdom.

 Administration Puts Bank Reform on Hold (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Clinton administration has given up for this year
efforts to consolidate the four federal banking regulatory agencies, a
key element of Vice President Gore's drive to ``reinvent government,''
administration officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The plan to bring all regulation of the nation's banks, savings
banks and savings and loan associations under a new Federal Banking
Commission was put on hold because of intense opposition from the
Federal Reserve Board, which objected to the administration's proposal
to take away most of the Fed's regulatory responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
``Even though we have made pretty good progress working with the
Fed, it has become increasingly clear that a realistic assessment of
the legislative calendar indicates it isn't going to be possible to
have regulatory consolidation done this year,'' Treasury
undersecretary Frank N. Newman said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
``There has to be a pause,'' a Fed spokesman said. ``But we hope
that by early 1995 we are able to produce a joint proposal (with the
administration) for Congress'' when it reconvenes in January.
</P>
<P>
Both the House and Senate are working on regulatory consolidation
bills, but the prospects for legislation have been fading fast because
of the split between the Fed and the Treasury and lukewarm industry
support.
</P>
<P>
Administration officials said they do not want to take time and
effort away from such major legislative issues as health-care reform
and trade.
</P>
<P>
Further, Congress already has two big banking bills to finish: The
House and Senate have each passed separate measures that would for the
first time permit nationwide banking, and House and Senate negotiators
are working out the differences between the two versions. Lawmakers
also are working on reconciling competing versions based on President
Clinton's Community Development Financial Institutions bill, which
would create a network of lending organizations to serve minority and
disadvantaged communities.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between Treasury and Fed officials, which have been
going on for months, will be halted because the two agencies need to
spend more time on other issues, such as what to do about regulating
derivatives, a family of exotic new investments that are largely
unregulated.
</P>
<P>
Industry officials said the foundering of the consolidation plan
was no surprise. ``The Treasury tactically made two mistakes that
caught up with them,'' said Kenneth Guenther, vice president of the
Independent Bankers Association of America, the small banks' industry
group. ``They didn't have (Fed Chairman Alan) Greenspan on board and
the banking industry was totally against them.''
</P>
<P>
Small banks ``will breathe a sigh of relief,'' Guenther said.
``People are comfortable with the status quo. I don't think they ever
made a convincing case that the status quo was so wrong it required
the sweeping changes they put on the table.''
</P>
<P>
Paul Schosberg, president of the Savings and Community Bankers of
America, said Friday's decision was ``acknowledging political reality.
Historically, the political constituency for restructuring and reform
tends to be pretty thin.''
</P>
<P>
Bankers were not convinced by the administration's claim that its
regulatory consolidation would reduce red tape and save bankers money,
Schosberg said. Federal banking regulation is now spread among four
agencies: The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regulates
national banks, the Office of Thrift Supervision handles savings and
loans, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. oversees most state
chartered banks and the Fed handles all bank holding companies and the
several hundred banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System.
</P>
<P>
The consolidation proposal would have largely taken away the Fed's
regulatory responsibilities, leaving it to concentrate on its primary
role of managing the economy. But Greenspan objected, saying that the
Fed needs to have hands-on contact with banks in order to monitor
their health and make sure the banking system is running efficiently.

 In the Rough 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The following editorial appeared in Saturday's Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's from seeing all those impeccably uniformed Marines
snapping to attention all the time. Or from riding in too many
presidential motorcades that can part traffic and force mere mortals
to idle as you zip by. Or maybe it's a simple loss of good judgment.
Somehow, for some presidential aides, spending too much time in the
White House is very dangerous. You start to think you own the place
and all that goes with it.
</P>
<P>
That, at least, is what seems to have happened with David Watkins,
who stepped down as director of the White House Office of
Administration after he and a colleague took a presidential helicopter
from Washington to a country club near New Market, Md., for a round of
golf on Tuesday afternoon. The hour or so it would have taken to drive
seemed just too inconvenient to Mr. Watkins, who no doubt wanted to
rush back to the White House to figure out how to save taxpayers'
money. Friday night, the story got a bit worse as the White House
announced in response to queries that a second chopper was sent out to
accompany the first.
</P>
<P>
The military, the White House said, normally sends helicopters out
in pairs -- apparently even to country clubs. Mr. Watkins has a thing
about transportation. Last year, he was disciplined for his role in
the firing of seven people from the White House travel office.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton, at least, seems to have learned something about
White House transportation issues and the damage control related
thereto. By Thursday, Mr. Watkins was out of there, and Mr. Clinton
said the taxpayers would be reimbursed for the golfing jaunt. In what
White House Communications Director Mark Gearan declared was ``a
gesture of friendship,'' 13 White House aides -- including White House
Chief of Staff Mack McLarty -- announced they'd contribute to paying
the costs of the flights. Staff solidarity may be a fine thing, but we
wonder what message this sends about the staff's attitude toward such
adventures. In particular, what is the view of Mr. McLarty, who is
supposed to stop these things from happening?
</P>
<P>
The worst of it is that Mr. Watkins said he had done nothing wrong
and reportedly balked at fully reimbursing the government,
necessitating the staff fund raising. In his resignation letter, he
insisted that his ``sole motivation was determining how you could
utilize Camp David more frequently,'' the golf club being near Camp
David. His letter paralleled an absurd early cover story put out by
White House Deputy Press Secretary Arthur Jones. In a statement, he
described the helicopter trip as a ``training mission'' to familiarize
the helicopter crew with the layout of the course.
</P>
<P>
The golf game? That was business, too: Mr. Watkins and his White
House colleague Alphonso Malden Jr. played their round ``in order to
familiarize themselves with all aspects of the course, especially
those aspects related to actual time of play and associated impact of
security plans.'' Right, and we propose to familiarize ourselves with
all aspects of every four-star restaurant in Paris in preparation for
the president's D-Day visit, especially those aspects related to the
actual time it takes to consume a meal and associated impact on
security plans of consuming several bottles of Bordeaux.

 Corrects to ``Rosetta Stone'' in last graf 
 `Flintstones': Stone Age Bomb (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
``The Flintstones,'' a $45 million dinosaur that hired
no fewer than 36 screenwriters and stars John Goodman, Rick Moranis,
Elizabeth Perkins and Rosie O'Donnell, isn't just awful. It bombs
itself into the Stone Age. As Fred Flintstone might have put it:
yabba-dabba-boo.
</P>
<P>
After faithfully duplicating the TV show's familiar opening
sequence -- in which Fred Flintstone (Goodman) knocks off work, howls
for joy, slides down his Bronto-crane tail and foot-shuffles away in
his prehistoric car -- the movie suffers immediate comic extinction.
Leadenly directed and almost soberly scripted, it never captures the
campy brightness of the original series -- the herky-jerky animation,
the wacky sound effects, the distinctive character voices and that
cheesy laugh track.
</P>
<P>
In the third-rate plot (and there's no telling who among the
Flintstone 36 came up with this gem), scheming boss Cliff Vandercave
(Kyle MacLachlan) and his comely secretary (Halle Berry) promote
unsuspecting Fred as a vice president, then frame him for
embezzlement, intending to abscond with the ill-gotten profit. Fred,
enjoying a life of unprecedented luxury, is obliged to fire Barney
(Moranis) and watch his friend sink into poverty before realizing his
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
If the performers are imitating their cartoon forebears, it is
barely apparent. Goodman's sweat-induced, growly offerings completely
bypass Fred's lovable, pigheaded innocence. The actor never attains
Fred's gravelly timbre. And with his blond-dyed hair and zombielike
demeanor, Moranis seems more like a zoned-out Warhol groupie than
Fred's perky buddy.
</P>
<P>
The greatest asset of Perkins's Wilma is that Perkins looks the
part. O'Donnell's dead-on Betty Rubble giggle is the funniest thing in
the movie, but it merely underlines how bad everyone -- and everything
 -- else is around her: The child actors who play Bamm-Bamm and Pebbles
are completely forgettable. Fred's pet dinosaur Dino, with its chintzy
eyes and unconvincing animatronic gyrations, looks like a low-budget
Muppet. And even Elizabeth Taylor, trundled out to play Fred's
insulting mother-in-law, falls disappointingly short of imperious. She
isn't exactly helped by the mediocre bones the screenplay tosses her
way.
</P>
<P>
While the movie -- officially scripted by Steven E. de Souza, Tom
Parker and Jim Jennewein -- labors through its primeval ooze, it churns
out incessant, dull visual gags, including a
Stonehenge-meets-'50s-America and the ``pigasaurus'' creature under
the sink that serves as a garbage disposal. It also heaves out unfunny
Hollywood ``inside'' jokes: The movie opens with a ``Steven Spielrock
Presents'' credit; Halle Berry's character is named Rosetta Stone;
George Lucas' ``Tar Wars'' is playing at the local theater. When,
inevitably, Fred -- locked out of the house by his pet saber-toothed
tiger -- thumps the door and yells ``Wilma!'', it doesn't bring ``The
Flintstones'' to a triumphant close. It just sets the audience free.
</P>
<P>
-- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
``The Flintstones'' is rated PG.

 Bosnians Resent U.N.'s Defeatist Attitude (Sarajevo) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On days when Bosnian Serb rebels
have allowed U.N. troops to patrol the mountainous terrain around
Sarajevo, the peacekeepers have counted at least 20 heavy artillery
pieces and seven tanks in violation of a NATO-proclaimed no-weapons
zone.
</P>
<P>
Despite a threat made more than three months ago to punish such
violations with air strikes, the U.N. Protection Force is still trying
to win withdrawal of the offending Serbian armor through negotiation.
</P>
<P>
In the eastern enclave of Gorazde, the U.N. mission has set aside
another NATO ultimatum. Serbian gunmen who invaded the purported U.N.
``safe haven'' in April have refused to heed a U.N. order to retreat.
But instead of ordering air strikes, the mission has asked the Bosnian
government to make a ``goodwill gesture'' to encourage its attackers
to pull back.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. commander for Bosnia, British Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, has
asked the Muslim-led government to withdraw its lightly armed defense
forces from the center of Gorazde -- an act of capitulation requested
neither by NATO nor by the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Rose insists that the threat of air strikes against those defying
the international community's efforts for peace is still credible.
</P>
<P>
But with mounting evidence that the mission has neither the will
nor the political backing to use force against transgressors,
cease-fires have broken down, fighting has escalated, and U.N.
officials have adopted a damage-control strategy that oscillates
between understatement and outright denial.
</P>
<P>
U.N. mission spokesman Maj. Rob Annink has begun each daily
briefing for the past week by describing the situation in
Bosnia-Herzegovina as ``stable,'' while subsequently reporting the
following incidents:
</P>
<P>
-- Serbs fired at least 500 artillery shells into the mostly Muslim
enclave of Bihac, another U.N.-protected area, in the 24 hours before
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
-- Government forces have been on the offensive against Serbs in the
central Bosnian town of Tesanj, as well as in Olovo and along 100
miles of front line that arcs between the two flash points.
</P>
<P>
-- Bosnian Croats and government troops have massed on either side of
the narrow Serb-held corridor linking conquered areas of eastern
Bosnia with Serbian spoils farther west. The Croats and Muslims, newly
reconciled allies, appear to be coordinating artillery attacks on the
town of Brcko, along the vital supply route.
</P>
<P>
-- Two Serbian tanks entered the weapons exclusion zone around
Sarajevo Monday to attack government forces in the town of Breza.
Another Serbian assault Wednesday against the government town of
Pazaric was also suspected to have been launched from the zone, which
is supposed to be demilitarized.
</P>
<P>
-- Tuesday, snipers killed a Bosnian woman riding a bus under U.N.
escort through Serb-held territory west of Sarajevo. Bosnian
government officials said she was at least the 40th civilian fatality
since NATO proclaimed a cease-fire in the area three months ago.
</P>
<P>
Sarajevo has not been under intense bombardment since the February
ultimatum, but sniping remains a daily danger and there have been
increasing instances of ``detonations'' which the U.N. spokesman
refuses to call shelling.
</P>
<P>
Foreign diplomats in Sarajevo express concern that Rose's
not-to-worry approach to collapsing cease-fires and fraying agreements
is giving the outside world the erroneous impression that the conflict
in Bosnia is on the mend.
</P>
<P>
``On the one hand he is putting pressure on the parties to settle
this thing diplomatically, by refusing to publicly acknowledge what is
going on,'' one European envoy said. ``On the other hand, he's taking
a tremendous risk of it all blowing up in his face, as it did in
Gorazde.''
</P>
<P>
Rose repeatedly characterized a recent Serbian offensive against
that safe area as a ``limited, tactical maneuver'' to improve the
rebels' bargaining position in stalled peace talks. But nearly half
the city fell to Serbian gunmen, tens of thousands of Muslims were
uprooted, and 700 people, mostly Muslim civilians, were killed in the
sustained artillery attack.
</P>
<P>
Another Western diplomat characterized the U.N. mission's attempt
to play down the spreading crisis as a consequence of the world's
major powers having given the peacekeepers no real option for
containing it.
</P>
<P>
``There's this assumption that Bosnia is already dead and it just
needs a proper burial,'' the diplomat said. ``The problem with that
assumption is that Bosnia is not dead, and it's going to continue
fighting.''
</P>
<P>
Rose warned the Bosnian army Tuesday that it should not pursue a
military solution to the conflict. While shepherding a NATO delegation
around some of central Bosnia's more peaceful venues, Rose told a
senior army commander that it would take years for the government to
get its troops armed and trained for a successful campaign to recover
lost territory.
</P>
<P>
Government officials say they resent the attitude that they should
accept defeat by a force repeatedly castigated by the U.N. Security
Council as the war's instigator.
</P>
<P>
``The problem is that the basic aim of the mission from the
beginning has been to see us capitulate,'' said Bosnian Information
Minister Ivo Knezevic. ``All their calculations have been based on
this assumption. We've blown all their plans because we do not accept
this. This is why we have become such an irritation to the
powerbrokers of the world.''

 SWAT: Elite Police Force Adapts to a Changing World (Los Angeles) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LOS ANGELES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 67 men of the Los Angeles Police Department's
Special Weapons and Tactics unit are members of the department's most
exclusive club. Handpicked for the duty after passing rigorous
entrance requirements, they train using live ammunition and confront
armed and barricaded suspects at the rate of more than one a week.
</P>
<P>
For a quarter-century, SWAT has occupied a unique place in the
Police Department and the public imagination -- a group of virtual
soldiers embedded in a police agency, their missions among the most
demanding in law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
The original SWAT team was pioneered by the LAPD, and it has grown
up there, evolving from a ragtag group of eager volunteers into a
tightly disciplined group of professionals whose officers train
side-by-side with Navy SEALS and Army Green Berets.
</P>
<P>
Insular and intensely proud, SWAT was battered and shaped by early
criticism and a pair of nationally renowned shootouts, one of which
occurred 20 years ago this month. It battled a reputation for
militarism, redoubled its emphasis on negotiation and emerged as one
of the nation's most widely emulated hostage-rescue organizations.
Most recently, when a highly regarded female officer was denied entry
into the unit, it raised the question of when, if ever, SWAT will open
its doors to women; her case is in court and its outcome could again
reshape SWAT as it continues to define its place within the LAPD.
</P>
<P>
As SWAT has changed, so has the Police Department, which is trying
to adopt a more community-oriented style that bears little resemblance
to the work SWAT officers perform.
</P>
<P>
But the paramilitary arm of the Police Department remains fully
staffed and in robust health -- despite the vogue for a kinder, gentler
force, despite money problems in municipal government, despite the
departure of its godfather and founder, former Chief Daryl F. Gates.
</P>
<P>
His successor, Willie L. Williams -- a police chief better known for
his devotion to community policing than his belief in special weapons
and tactics -- has expressed his confidence in the unit. More
important, he has kept it at full strength despite cutbacks in other
areas of the Police Department and pressure to put more officers on
patrol.
</P>
<P>
This summer, SWAT will stand guard against terrorism during the
World Cup games, the same function it performed a decade ago during
the Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The 1965 Watts riots made a deep impression on the city and its
police -- and no one reacted more strongly than a young commander named
Daryl Gates. Convinced that the riots proved the need for the LAPD to
better counteract sniper fire, Gates pioneered SWAT, making the LAPD
the nation's first police department to develop such an organization.
</P>
<P>
In the early years, SWAT was informal. Officers continued to work
their regular jobs, they got no bonus pay, and they kept a decidedly
low profile.
</P>
<P>
The officers who staffed SWAT in the early years -- veterans now
refer to the team during that period as ``Old SWAT'' -- were dedicated
to the mission but sometimes ill-equipped to carry it out. And on Dec.
8, 1969, Old SWAT came face-to-face with the Black Panthers. When the
officers arrived at a Central Avenue stronghold to serve arrest and
search warrants, they were greeted with shotgun blasts and
submachine-gun fire.
</P>
<P>
Over the next five hours, more than 200 Los Angeles police officers
and a handful of Black Panthers exchanged thousands of rounds of
gunfire. When it was over, three officers and six Black Panthers were
hurt.
</P>
<P>
Although no one died, the Black Panther shootout raised deep
concerns. To do its job correctly, LAPD leaders decided, SWAT needed
to be a formal unit whose officers trained and worked together full
time. In 1971, Old SWAT became New SWAT, a full-fledged unit under the
wing of the department's Metropolitan Division.
</P>
<P>
Then, on May 17, 1974, the LAPD engaged in the most notorious
gunfight in the history of the organization. That afternoon, three
SWAT squads, hundreds of other police officers and FBI agents
descended on a 54th Street home where they expected to find members of
the Symbionese Liberation Army, the group that had kidnapped heiress
Patricia Hearst a few months before.
</P>
<P>
For about two hours, police and suspects traded shots while news
crews broadcast the shootout nationwide. Eventually, the house burned
to the ground. Six SLA members died, three from gunshots, three from
the fire.
</P>
<P>
As the Panther battle had in 1969, this major shootout forced the
LAPD once again to review the way its SWAT officers went about their
work.
</P>
<P>
``When I took over Metro (a few months after the SLA incident),
there was a lot of sensitivity about SWAT,'' said Jesse Brewer, who
went on to become an assistant chief and then president of Police
Commission. ``There was a feeling that we were using military tactics
against citizens.''
</P>
<P>
Brewer tightened SWAT's admission standards, clamped down on
discipline, insisted that SWAT officers treat members of the community
with respect. Under him, the unit replaced its old tear-gas canisters,
which were implicated in starting the fire that destroyed the SLA
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
All of that helped calm the waters, but the evolution of SWAT
reflects a constant balancing between the unit's use of military
tactics and the department's desire to project a friendly public
image.
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1980s, that tension flared up again when SWAT began
using a pair of battering ram-equipped small tanks, known as V-100s,
in some confrontations.
</P>
<P>
``That sent a terrible signal,'' said Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., a
prominent Los Angeles attorney and frequent police critic. ``It
reinforced that whole argument about the LAPD as an occupying army.''
</P>
<P>
Without ever admitting a mistake, the LAPD scaled back the use of
the tanks. Today they sit mostly idle, and criticism of the unit is
mostly muted. Cochran and Stephen Yagman, two of the city's most
prominent civil rights lawyers, say they haven't handled any SWAT
cases in years. Cochran says his impression is that the unit has
improved from its rougher origins.
</P>
<P>
In large measure, that is because negotiations or other, less
subtle, forms of persuasion resolve almost all SWAT situations without
gunshots. Still, there are times when SWAT officers make the hardest
of all decisions in police work: When its officers believe they have
exhausted all other remedies and feel lives are in danger, SWAT will
shoot to kill.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
If SWAT was born in the aftermath of the Watts riots, it came of
age in the buildup for the 1984 Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Confident as ever, Gates announced that SWAT would handle any
outbreak of terrorism inside the city limits. He sent three of his
most trusted officers -- Lt. Jeff Rogers, who headed the unit at the
time, Sgt. Al Preciado and Capt. John Higgins -- to Europe, where they
studied counterterrorism units in Israel, Italy, France, West Germany,
West Berlin and England. ``We came back with a whole head full of
ideas and a shopping list of what we needed,'' Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
They got it. Some new equipment was purchased by the Olympic
Organizing Committee. Other pieces -- special poles with mirrors that
allow officers to look around corners without being seen, flashlights
that attach to the barrels of rifles -- were invented by officers in
the Metro armory.
</P>
<P>
SWAT also revolutionized its training.
</P>
<P>
Before the 1984 Olympics, SWAT trained with blanks. Today, SWAT,
unlike any other unit in the LAPD, uses live ammunition in
hostage-rescue training.
</P>
<P>
SWAT officers spend 240 hours a year shooting, climbing, rappelling
and practicing other tactics. They fire out of helicopters, rappel off
the sides of some buildings and scale the walls of others. They drop
from helicopters onto rooftops. It's grueling, dangerous work, but it
underscores a message: Things sometimes go wrong; SWAT needs to be
ready when they do.
</P>
<P>
``You perform like you practice,'' one SWAT cop said. ``For real.''

 In Bosnia, Islam Has Many Faces (Sarajevo) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Black nylon stockings and
patent-leather shoes peeking out from beneath Ajla Nuhbegovic's tunic
clash flirtatiously with her head scarf and neck-to-ankle garb.
</P>
<P>
Ajla has every intention of wearing lipstick, eye makeup and
jewelry when she's old enough, the enshrouded 12-year-old explains
between licks of a dripping ice-cream cone.
</P>
<P>
She shrugs off what some might see as an incongruous melding of
religious modesty and a young girl's natural interest in being
attractive to boys.
</P>
<P>
``We have drifted too far from our religion. I think girls should
dress in this manner, at least until they are 18,'' Ajla insists,
contradicting her father's aside that she can more often be found in
form-fitting leggings and sweat shirts.
</P>
<P>
Her fleeting earnestness provokes a look of amused tolerance from
her father, Hajrudin, a wry smile that suggests he thinks she is just
going through a phase.
</P>
<P>
Ajla may be unevenly absorbing the religious instruction offered at
the Muslim parochial school she has been attending for two years.
</P>
<P>
But amid the hardships of war and the Christian world's growing
indifference to the plight of Bosnian Muslims, the desire to express a
faith that was repressed here for most of this century is becoming
more common.
</P>
<P>
The Slavs whose ancestors embraced Islam during Ottoman Turkey's
500-year rule are increasingly searching for solace where they can
find it, as they continue to be targeted by a deadly Serb nationalist
campaign of ``ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
And as Western nations turn their backs on Bosnia because its
conflict seems too complex to resolve, moderates warn they have no
choice but to grasp the hand of Islam, as long as it remains the only
one offered to them.
</P>
<P>
Bosnia's streets, even in cosmopolitan Sarajevo, are traversed by
growing numbers of women who dress with at least partial deference to
Islamic tradition. Mosques that were mostly tourist attractions in the
Communist era are crowded with the faithful; Muslim feasts and
celebrations are now official holidays.
</P>
<P>
Most obviously, and most worrisome for the non-Muslim majority of
Bosnia, is the strengthening bond between this secular country in the
heart of Europe and fundamentalist Islamic nations that have come to
its aid out of sympathy for a people endangered because of their
faith.
</P>
<P>
Iran has smuggled weaponry to the Bosnian government defying a U.N.
embargo that most Western countries concede tied the hands of this
nation's defense forces throughout 26 months of assault by heavily
armed Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Libya has supplied oil when there was no money for imports. Saudi
Arabia has bankrolled pilgrimages to Mecca for 350 invalids and war
casualties. And Islamic warriors from Afghanistan to Algeria have
flocked to Bosnia's battle zones to fight for Allah, perverting an
already beleaguered defense effort into a holy war no one in Bosnia
wanted.
</P>
<P>
``We have been waiting for two years for the West to help us defeat
fascism, for its own interest if not for our benefit,'' says Osman
Brka, a leader of the Muslim-dominated Party for Democratic Action.
``We still hope against hope that America will see it must help us
defend the democratic values we share. But we will look to anyone
willing to help us, and no one in the West will have the right to
blame us if they turned away.''
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Until the Serb rebellion that began in April 1992 threw this former
Yugoslav republic into social and economic chaos, Bosnian ties to
Islam were tenuous at best.
</P>
<P>
Today's 2 million Bosnian Muslims are descended from Serbs, Croats
and a schismatic Christian sect known as the Bogomils who were
repressed by both Catholic and Orthodox Slavs. Their forebears
acquiesced to the Turkish conquerors' religion and mores, creating a
culture through half a millennium distinct from that of the Serbs and
Croats.
</P>
<P>
The Muslims, or Bosnjaks, as most preferred to be called,
identifying themselves with the territory rather than religion, were
ruled by the Turks until the Serbs threw off the Ottoman yoke late in
the 19th century. While Serbia retained its independence, Bosnia was
swallowed by the Austro-Hungarian Empire, providing the friction that
led to World War I and the eventual creation of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The years between the two world wars subjected the Muslims to crude
assimilation attempts by both Serbs and Croats, until Communist
partisan leader Marshal Tito led the country to victory over Nazi
Germany. During his 35-year rule -- arguably Eastern Europe's most
benevolent dictatorship -- Tito imposed peace among the fractious
Balkan ethnic groups through a delicate balance of force and
personality.
</P>
<P>
In recognition of their divergent lifestyle, Tito conferred the
status of a nationality on Bosnian Muslims in 1970.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
In the twisted rationale of propagandized Serb nationalists, the
Muslims have ``stolen'' Serb land by taking on a separate identity.
The current war in Bosnia is, in the eyes of the rebels, a campaign to
recover territory lost when Serbian and other Slavic owners converted
from Christianity.
</P>
<P>
To justify their rebellion to the outside world, Bosnian Serb rebel
leader Radovan Karadzic has repeatedly warned that the presence of
Muslims here poses a risk of fundamentalist Islam establishing a
foothold in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim-led government that gained power after 1990 elections
has always rejected that claim as a cynical scare tactic aimed at
defusing Western concern over the civilian slaughter and expulsion of
Muslims by Serbs as they take territory for a Greater Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Serb accusations that other Balkan ethnic groups threaten them have
been a cornerstone of the expansion plan drafted and executed by
strongman Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
Exaggerated claims that Serb lives were at risk if Croatia seceded
became fact after Milosevic sent the Yugoslav Peoples Army to seize
land coveted by the Serbs and to expel Croats, creating a climate of
hostility and a desire for revenge against the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Serbian propaganda has for seven years accused the Albanian
majority in Kosovo province of plotting secession and annexation to
neighboring Albania. The claim was ludicrous when Albania endured the
most brutal Stalinist regime in Europe. But two years of democratic
reform in Albania has coincided with ever-intensifying repression of
Kosovo Albanians by Serb security forces, making union with Albania
genuinely attractive for the Kosovo majority.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian government and social leaders insist theirs could never
become an officially Islamic state. But some concede the stronger ties
to Islamic countries emerging as a consequence of abandonment by the
West play into the hands of propagandists in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
``We Muslims have never sought to live separately and we still
believe the best solution for Bosnia is a country that unites all
three nations,'' said Husajn Smajic, the mufti of Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
Smajic describes Bosnia's Islamic community as unique and more
heavily influenced by Europe than other countries with which it shares
the faith.
</P>
<P>
War horrors and disappointment in Western indifference to the human
rights violations committed against them has driven more Muslims to
turn to their religion in this time of crisis, Smajic said, accounting
for the visible signs that religious expression is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
The main influence of a more visible Islam has been to instill
confusion among those who have long described themselves as Muslims
but had little means of expressing that identity during the last
century when they were ruled by Catholic Austrians, Orthodox Serbs and
atheistic Communists by turns.
</P>
<P>
Ajla is one of many young Bosnian Muslims who seem to be following
Islamic doctrine more out of fashion than conviction. It is not
unusual to see young women on the streets with gauzy white scarves
draped far enough back on their lacquered hairdos to expose dangling
earrings and a colorful facial palette of cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
``We laid in a big stock of beer for Bajram,'' said cafe waitress
Dina Hasanagic. ``We are aware of the irony, but this is our way of
doing things. Whether it's Bajram or Easter, it's a holiday, and we
just want to drink and have a good time.''

 Clinton's Brave Retreat on China 
 The following editorial appeared in Saturday's Baltimore Sun: 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In politics as in war, it is more difficult to execute a retreat
than to go on the offensive. President Clinton's retreat from
ill-conceived attempts to base U.S. trade policy with China on the
human rights record of the hardline Beijing regime is one of the most
difficult calls he has made since taking office. But his decision was
correct and courageous. It shores up the U.S. position in Asia and
actually promotes a trend toward individual liberty in China that is
linked to a booming economy.
</P>
<P>
That Clinton is taking catcalls from the likes of Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell and House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt says
more about what is wrong with the president's party than about the
president. The Democrats continue to be tugged into untenable
positions by protectionists, Big Labor and self-appointed moralists
and causists. As a candidate for the White House, Clinton went along
with their get-tough tactics toward China and even accused George Bush
of ``coddling'' the Beijing masterminds of the Tiananmen Square
massacre. As president, he has felt the need to echo Bush's admonition
that the United States must ``avoid isolating China.''
</P>
<P>
The reasons are clear enough. China is a nuclear power with veto
authority in the U.N. Security Council. It is the world's most
populous nation with the world's fastest-growing economy. It has more
influence than any other country over a North Korean regime suspected
of building a nuclear weapons arsenal. It will take possession of Hong
Kong later in this decade, a step with enormous ramifications in Asia.
Just before the Clinton decision, China eliminated 195 quota and
license regulations in preparation for joining the World Trade
Organization -- a step toward drawing closer to the international
community in other productive ways.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell and Gephardt have announced their intention to introduce
legislation to overturn Clinton's order preserving ``most favored
nation'' (i.e. normal) trading status with China. President Bush had
to veto such legislation three times. In the event the Democratic
majority enacts a similar measure once again, Clinton can count on
Republican support if he casts another veto. The ironies are large.
</P>
<P>
In his executive order, the president took one punitive step by
banning the import of guns and ammunition made by factories affiliated
with the People's Liberation Army. This will eliminate only a $100
million sliver of $31 billion in Chinese exports to the United States.
It can be regarded more as a gun-control measure than a trade
sanction, and welcomed as such.
</P>
<P>
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow once wrote that ``a masterly retreat is
itself a victory.'' It is too early to determine that Clinton's
retreat is masterly. But because facts and reality and a clear
appreciation of U.S. national interests are on his side, he should in
the end come out all right on this issue. Had he opted the other way,
he would have had a foreign policy disaster on his hands.

 No One Knows Why Prominent Israelis' Phones Tapped (Jerusalem) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What do Israeli President Ezer Weizman, Tel Aviv Mayor
Ronni Milo, the editors and publishers of the country's best-selling
newspapers, two bank managers, the manager of the Maccabees soccer
team, several big building contractors and the owner of high-fashion
clothing stores have in common?
</P>
<P>
The answer is that they were all on a list of 231 Israelis -- many
politically prominent, some financially powerful but a few relatively
obscure -- whose cellular telephones were methodically tapped for eight
months by two Tel Aviv private investigators.
</P>
<P>
But the real riddle -- why? -- so far has no answer.
</P>
<P>
The two investigators, arrested in April and facing charges of
illegal wiretapping, are refusing to tell police who hired them or
what they overheard.
</P>
<P>
Rafi Friedan, one of the investigators, initially told police that
he had been asked ``to gather data'' and that he was confident that
his clients' reasons were ``personal and family related,'' according
to court records. But Friedan has said nothing further, on his
lawyers' advice.
</P>
<P>
The list of those whose calls were regularly monitored, according
to preliminary evidence given Tel Aviv courts, is a veritable Who's
Who of Israel's movers and shakers -- and a warning to a
security-conscious country of the risks many of its leaders are
running in unguarded conversations on their always-in-use cellular
phones.
</P>
<P>
``The police have found records of some conversations of some of
our people that are, well, rather embarrassing in their content,'' a
senior Israeli official commented, asking not to be quoted by name.
``Things were said that should not have been said on open lines, and
then things were said that were professionally indiscreet.''
</P>
<P>
Among the phones that were monitored, according to police, were
some belonging to the Israeli Defense Ministry, senior officials of
the country's security services, two members of the opposition Likud
Party, the state comptroller and the director of an airline used by
the government for charter flights.
</P>
<P>
There were also Weizman, top executives of the country's two
television stations, a number of lawyers, the agency that administers
the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem's Old City, an insurance company,
staff members from the newspapers Yediot Aharonot, Maariv and Haaretz
 -- and 10 other private investigators.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Altogether, more than 400 different cellular telephones may have
been monitored from August until the men's arrest last month,
according to prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
Friedan and Yaakov Tsur, his partner in Agam Security Consultants,
were held for three weeks and are now under house arrest. If convicted
under Israel's laws prohibiting wiretapping, they would face sentences
of three years for each conversation they monitored.
</P>
<P>
Although police do not believe the two monitored all conversations,
they have had very limited success in determining which calls they did
record and no luck in finding out what they did with them.
</P>
<P>
``Their clients did not exactly pay with company checks,'' one
police detective said.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors theorize the monitoring operation may have grown out of
the bitter rivalry between Yediot Aharonot and Maariv, which have been
engaged in a long-running circulation war. But they are at a loss to
explain how it came to encompass such high-ranking officials.

 Bloomin' Scandal Rocks This Year's Chelsea Flower Show (London) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since 1888, the Chelsea Flower Show has been the most
genteel of British institutions: a magnificent display of flowers,
shrubs, exotic plants and everything else imaginable for a garden.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the Royal Horticultural Society, the show attracts
hundreds of exhibitors and tens of thousands of dedicated visitors to
the grounds of the Royal Hospital in London's Chelsea for five days in
May.
</P>
<P>
There they view orchids, violets, begonias, delphiniums, roses,
azaleas, freesias, daffodils, lupins, clematises and dozens more in
elaborate displays.
</P>
<P>
After visits by Queen Elizabeth II and other members of the Royal
Family, highly prized gold medals are awarded to those exhibitors with
the most attractive displays from nurseries across Britain.
</P>
<P>
But this year -- horror of horrors! -- a scandal has rocked the
flower show and dealt a blow to a great British tradition: It has been
revealed that many of the exhibitors have shown flower displays not
from their own gardens.
</P>
<P>
Worse, many of the flowers came directly from London's huge Covent
Garden Market.
</P>
<P>
Worst of all, many of the flowers have come from abroad -- from
Holland!
</P>
<P>
The disclosure caused an uproar this week, shocking the thousands
of innocent visitors who assume the flowers are grown in the green
fields of England.
</P>
<P>
Apparently the practice of ``buying-in,'' or purchasing flowers
from outside sources for exhibition, has been going on for years with
the knowledge of the Royal Horticultural Society.
</P>
<P>
Some observers regarded the revelations as evidence marking the
decline of another bastion of gentility. The Chelsea Flower Show, the
world's largest, is the highlight of the year for lovers of Britain's
favorite outdoor pastime -- gardening.
</P>
<P>
As one mourner noted, ``First it was our disastrous cricket season.
Then the BBC went on strike for a day. Now the flower show. What
next?''
</P>
<P>
That reporters at the British Broadcasting Corp. -- long an emblem
of upper-middle-class rectitude -- would strike instead of standing by
at their microphones once seemed unthinkable, as did British cricket
losses to teams from countries that learned the sport from the
colonial masters.
</P>
<P>
John Metcalf of the Four Seasons nurseries in Norwich, who displays
only blooms he has grown and was awarded a silver medal, was angered
by the buying-in and called for a ban on exhibitors displaying other
people's plants.
</P>
<P>
``It's like an athlete in the Olympics letting someone else run
their race,'' he said, ``and then going on to collect the medal.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
More than a quarter of the 51 exhibitors who won gold medals
admitted buying-in some of their stock. Many of the flowers displayed
came from the ``glass house'' area of the Netherlands, which
year-round grows lilies, chrysanthemums, freesias and peonies for
wholesalers in Britain. Those wholesalers sell to Covent Garden
companies.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Horticultural Society has been swamped with letters
protesting buying-in since the practice became known just before this
year's show opened on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Chelsea organizers maintain that they have no way to monitor
where blooms are grown, so they have not prohibited buying-in but
simply asked exhibitors to note whether they originated their own
flowers.
</P>
<P>
Besides, organizers argue, medals are awarded for showmanship and
the artistry and quality of a display.
</P>
<P>
That explanation has been lost on many.
</P>
<P>
``When someone shows a product they have not grown without making
it clear, they are cheating,'' said one flower lover. ``It is not
right.''

 Loud Voice From U.N.'s Bully Pulpit 
 The following editorial appeared in Saturday's Los Angeles Times: 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali refuses to let the
genocide in Rwanda go unchallenged. He scolds the West for not
responding to the crisis. He chides Africa for not sending more troops
to stop the killing. It's a good use of his international bully
pulpit.
</P>
<P>
Though he met Friday with President Clinton, Boutros-Ghali can't
drum up the political support he did when he finally persuaded George
Bush and other nations' leaders to send troops to Somalia. That
thankless operation soured much of the West on the idea of dispatching
troops to another bloody foreign power struggle.
</P>
<P>
The American casualties in Somalia prompted the Clinton
administration to develop a new and stringent policy on peacekeeping,
Presidential Policy Directive 25, which Clinton signed May 5. Even
when no U.S. troops are promised, the new policy calls on the
secretary general to answer a series of tough questions posed by the
United States, such as which countries will send troops, what role the
troops will play on the ground and when they will leave. Washington
demands satisfactory responses because Americans pay one-third of the
U.N. peacekeeping budget; although U.S. lives might not be on the
line, U.S. tax dollars would be.
</P>
<P>
In order to comply with the new U.S. directive, the U.N. Security
Council delayed sending 5,500 troops to Rwanda to allow time for a
study of what can be accomplished in the Central African nation while
the fighting rages. The troops would go only if the secretary general
determined that the combatants would cooperate with the United Nations
by agreeing to a cease-fire, that foreign troops were indeed available
and that any mission in Rwanda would be short-lived.
</P>
<P>
Additional delays have been caused by the refusal of most African
nations to commit troops to a U.N. peacekeeping force. So far, only
Ghana, Ethiopia, Senegal and Zimbabwe have committed. Boutros-Ghali
has tried to put together an all-African contingent to secure Rwanda's
Kigali airport, ensure the flow of relief supplies and create safe
havens for fleeing Rwandans. The reluctance of neighbors to get
involved is not unusual in Africa, where isolationism is encouraged by
the charter of the Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
Since the deaths of Burundi's President Cyprian Ntayamira and
Rwanda's President Juvenal Habyarimana in a suspicious plane crash
April 6, more than 200,000 people have been killed in fighting between
members of the Tutsi and Hutu tribes. U.N. officials will try again on
Monday to negotiate a cease-fire. That's a start, but only a start.
</P>
<P>
What would it take to get more help for Rwanda? Neo-colonial
meddling is inappropriate, but for so many African nations to sit by
while hundreds of thousands of neighbors die is unconscionable.

 Asian Nations Flex Muscle in Disputes with West (Bangkok) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BANGKOK, Thailand
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly 30 years ago, the United States issued a
clarion call against the spread of communism in Asia and Southeast
Asian nations eagerly united behind the American initiative.
</P>
<P>
But when Washington tried to pull together similar support this
year to isolate Myanmar, where human rights violations are rife, the
coalition balked.
</P>
<P>
Thailand said that instead of isolation it would offer
``constructive engagement'' to the military regime in Myanmar,
formerly known as Burma. Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong paid a
friendly state visit to Yangon, the capital. The six-member
Association of Southeast Asian Nations even invited Myanmar to send
the leader of its military junta to its annual meeting here this July.
</P>
<P>
More and more, the economically booming nations of Asia are flexing
their political muscle in disputes with the United States and the
West, especially on such sensitive issues as human rights, freedom of
expression and labor rights.
</P>
<P>
Some call it the Asian Way; others refer to neo-Confucianism or
East Asian authoritarianism. A hybrid of traditional Asian culture and
1990s economics, this doctrine champions society over the individual
and ``family values'' over what is seen as corroding Western
influences. Most important, according to its ardent believers in China
and the surrounding states of Southeast Asia, economic development
requires a period of political stability not possible under democracy
 -- a notion derided by Western critics as justification for tyranny.
</P>
<P>
Whatever the name, the Asian Way doctrine is a distinctly post-Cold
War phenomenon that may spell declining U.S. influence in the region
and threatens to raise friction across the Pacific in years ahead.
</P>
<P>
``With the growth of their economic prosperity, East Asian
countries are becoming more assertive politically,'' said Washington
SyCip, a prominent Manila business consultant. ``I think you'll see
them being more and more forthright and stating what their values
are.'' Bearing him out are statistics showing the combined gross
domestic product of East Asia -- Japan, China, Taiwan, South Korea and
the Southeast Asian nations -- was 4 percent of the world economy in
1960; by 2010, it is expected to be 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
Is the Asian Way really new? After all, both Taiwan and South Korea
boomed economically under authoritarian regimes and have made the
transition to democracies. But in the 1960s and 1970s, the United
States was more willing to turn a blind eye to human rights abuses in
the name of anti-Communist solidarity. Only since the Cold War ended
in 1988 has Washington seemed eager to confront Asian countries with
broader issues of democracy and labor rights.
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic example of Asian muscle-flexing is the debate
between Washington and the Communist rulers in Beijing over human
rights, culminating in President Clinton's decision announced Thursday
to renew most-favored-nation (MFN) trade status for China. The United
States had linked continuation of the trade benefits with human rights
improvements, but Clinton was forced to make an embarrassing retreat.
</P>
<P>
When Secretary of State Warren Christopher visited Beijing in
March, Premier Li Peng warned him that China ``will never accept U.S.
human rights concepts.'' As Christopher expressed outrage at the
detention of Chinese dissidents, Li responded by warning that if its
trade status is revoked, ``the United States will suffer no less than
China.''
</P>
<P>
China's economy is booming, with growth at 13.4 percent last year,
and European as well as American businesses are scrambling to enter
the market. Even though China runs a $23-billion surplus with the
United States, meaning it would suffer much more from a trade drop, it
was American businessmen who spoke gloomily about the potential loss
of 200,000 jobs if MFN status were revoked -- enough to sway the
President.
</P>
<P>
While many Asian countries remain wary of a resurgent China, the
U.S. linkage of trade and human rights did not find a sympathetic
audience in the region.
</P>
<P>
``When China becomes powerful in 20 or 30 years' time, there is no
reason why China should behave kindly toward the West,'' said
Singapore's Goh when asked about the possible effect of trade
sanctions on Beijing. ``That's our worry: China may want to flex its
muscles and then it will be a very troublesome world.'' He added that
Singapore will continue to invest in China no matter what the United
States decides to do.

</P>
<P>
Even Australia, normally a champion of human rights but now
courting Asia's business, has parted company with the United States in
its dispute with China. Australia's ambassador to Washington, Don
Russell, urged the Clinton administration in April to drop its
aggressive pursuit of human rights and adopt a low-key dialogue with
China using ``constructive, non-confrontational engagement.''
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asian nations are similarly assertive with the United
States and Europe about Myanmar, because of budding economic ties and
dislike of outside interference. No one disputes the country's
appalling human rights record, in which thousands of demonstrators
have been killed and the military junta has rejected the results of a
May 1990 election that was won in a landslide by the opposition
National League for Democracy. The league's chairwoman, Aung Sang Suu
Kyi, has been under house arrest for nearly five years.
</P>
<P>
Winston Lord, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asian
affairs, called on Myanmar's neighbors to help isolate the country's
generals until the human rights picture improved. But last month Lord
was forced to concede that ``as friends,'' the United States and
Southeast Asia ``have agreed to disagree on the approaches.''
</P>
<P>
Singapore is the largest investor in Myanmar, followed by Thailand
and Japan. But beyond economic questions, Southeast Asian countries
are loath to allow outside powers to interfere in what they consider
to be the internal affairs of a neighboring state.
</P>
<P>
``If we were to adopt the Western approach with Burma, we would be
abandoning our role,'' said Thai Foreign Minister Prasong Soonsiri.
``We are neighbors and we should keep up relations in order to bring
them out into the world community.'' The other members of ASEAN -- 
Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Indonesia and the Philippines -- have
agreed to follow the policy of ``constructive engagement'' toward
Myanmar.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
One of the paradoxes of the recent assertion of the Asian Way is
that no two Asian nations are culturally identical. Corruption-free
Singapore stands in contrast to the venality of Indonesia and
Thailand, and the media are as free in the Philippines and Thailand as
they are controlled in Malaysia and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Critics, mostly in the West, argue that there really is no Asian
Way. They say this is a convenient slogan seized by undemocratic
rulers to justify their continued hold on power.
</P>
<P>
Kishore Mahbubani, the top civil servant in Singapore's Foreign
Ministry, published an essay in the Washington Quarterly this year in
which he blamed America's current troubles on too much freedom. ``In a
major reversal of a pattern lasting centuries, many Western societies
 -- including the United States -- are doing some major things
fundamentally wrong while a growing number of East Asian societies are
doing the same things right,'' Mahbubani said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
A Stanford University professor wryly observed that Singapore's
recent caning of American teen-ager Michael Fay for vandalism made him
the first known victim of the ``clash of civilizations'' expected to
take place between Asia and the United States. President Clinton
denounced the punishment as extreme, but many Asians -- and a fair
number of Americans -- decried America's crime rate and said it needed
to adopt more stringent punishments.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the issue of human rights, few things make Asian leaders
bristle as much as the Western media. China, Malaysia and Singapore
have banned individual ownership of satellite dishes to prevent direct
reception of Western programming, which they view as an assault on
Asian values.
</P>
<P>
Another issue on which Asia and the West seem likely to collide is
labor rights. The United States and France have suggested that a
worldwide minimum wage be adopted by the World Trade Organization to
stop the exploitation of workers in poor countries.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammed said the West's
``professed concern about workers' welfare is motivated by
self-interest,'' because, he said, low wages are the developing
world's only competitive advantage against the industrialized West.
</P>
<P>
``Washington's newfound concern for workers' rights is downright
exploitation of workers in poor countries.''

 Kennedy's Role in Health Care Reignites His Career (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the only one of five committee chairmen charged
with health care reform who is making visible progress, Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy was being quizzed by reporters last week about President
Clinton's appearance on Capitol Hill to rally support for the effort.
</P>
<P>
The Massachusetts Democrat had already begun lumbering off when he
got a final query about whether he was the one who had prompted
Clinton's last-minute decision to meet with Republican critics as well
as with his own party leaders.
</P>
<P>
Flattered by the suggestion he had a hand in this intrigue, Kennedy
suddenly whirled around with an impish twinkle in his eye and quipped:
``No, I wish I had. Can we start this over again?''
</P>
<P>
Somehow, in the flash of that magnificent Kennedy smile, the years
just disappeared.
</P>
<P>
These are glorious days for America's aging political prince. After
three tumultuous decades of high drama and low moments, Kennedy is
playing a pivotal role in what could be the crowning achievement of
his career: enactment of national health care legislation.
</P>
<P>
``This is the fulfillment of something he's been working on for at
least 25 years,'' said Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II, the senator's nephew
and another Massachusetts Democrat. ``He's going to move mountains to
get it passed.''
</P>
<P>
At a time when other congressional leaders are weakened or
distracted, Kennedy has his Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee
steadily moving forward. He is seen as certain to be the first full
committee chairman in either the House or Senate to win approval for
any version of health care reform legislation.
</P>
<P>
And despite his reputation as the poster boy for liberal Democratic
causes, Kennedy is picking up Republican votes for nearly every
section of his bill. He has a reliable majority of Democrats, but he
urges his committee members to shape bipartisan compromises every time
they hit a snag.
</P>
<P>
To some degree, the Republicans are just trying to make the best of
what they consider a bad bill because it is too generous in its
benefits and too burdensome on employers. On the final vote for
committee approval for the Kennedy proposal, the only Republican
likely to support it is James M. Jeffords of Vermont, a co-sponsor of
the original Clinton proposal.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's bill is also certain to run into opposition from
conservative and moderate Democrats when it reaches the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Nancy L. Kassebaum of Kansas, the ranking Republican on
the committee, said she believes some of the bipartisan compromises
the panel is reaching on side issues -- such as a fail-safe process for
controlling benefit costs -- could find their way into law.
</P>
<P>
At a minimum, Kennedy's committee offers hope for passing health
care reform this year when progress elsewhere is hard to find.
</P>
<P>
``This committee is moving along at a better pace than anyone else
on health care reform,'' Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat
who serves on the panel, observed with satisfaction during a voting
session this week. ``And we're doing it with a better tone.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's delight in his progress on the health care legislation
was overshadowed by the recent death of his sister-in-law, Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis. As patriarch of the Kennedy clan, it fell to him to
comfort his huge family through yet another tragedy.
</P>
<P>
There are also signs of trouble at home in Massachusetts, where
surveys suggest that Kennedy may be vulnerable to a re-election
challenge for the first time since he arrived in Washington 32 years
ago. A majority of those questioned in a recent Boston Globe poll
indicated they thought it might be time for the 62-year-old Kennedy to
retire.
</P>
<P>
Reminders during the Onassis funeral of the rakishly handsome youth
who was first elected to the Senate when his brother was president
have been a mixed blessing for the ``Teddy'' of today. The ruddy-faced
veteran of what Kennedy acknowledges as too many long nights on the
town has seen his poll ratings sink at a time when he's getting around
the state more than he has in years.
</P>
<P>
``To see him is not to love him,'' said Ronald Kaufman, a
Republican political operative from Massachusetts who served in the
Bush White House. ``He doesn't look good.''
</P>
<P>
By all accounts, Kennedy's remarriage two years ago to Victoria
Reggie has brought stability to his personal life. The two joined in a
Christmas party skit last year that poked fun at his licentious
bachelor behavior.
</P>
<P>
``He's changed a great deal,'' said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, a Utah
Republican and close friend of Kennedy. ``I've been there throughout
the process, and I have to say his marriage to Vicki has been a
wonderful thing for him.''
</P>
<P>
Kennedy turned to Hatch for counsel and help after the 1991
incident during which his nephew, William Kennedy Smith, was charged
with rape, Hatch said. The incident reflected badly on Kennedy because
he had awakened the younger man to go out drinking with him earlier
that evening.
</P>
<P>
The physical effects of those years of hard living are not easy to
reverse. But Kennedy advisers say they aren't worried. His campaign
has a huge war chest of $8 million to spend on getting out the message
of how effective Kennedy is on the job.
</P>
<P>
Most gratifying for Kennedy is that he has upended the predictions
of those who had written him off as too liberal to be a major player
in the health care debate.
</P>
<P>
Said White House lobbyist Steven J. Ricchetti: ``He's staying in
the game.''

 A Virginia Town Recalls Its D-Day Heroes (Bedford, Va.) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BEDFORD, Va.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Long gone are the boys of Bedford, gone these 50
years, lost in the roiling English Channel and on the sands of Omaha,
cut down by German pillboxes and artillery shells that blew men and
machines and whole boats out of the water.
</P>
<P>
Gone a half century now, these were the Gold Stars of Bedford, the
young men who would never marry their sweethearts or raise families,
who would not return to the farm, who would never gather Saturdays at
Green's Drug Store and dazzle the younger boys with stories of heroism
on D-day, June 6, 1944.
</P>
<P>
These men -- 19 sons of Bedford killed on D-day alone, the largest
proportion of casualties for any community in the nation -- lie under
great oak trees at the town cemetery and under white crosses on the
fields of Normandy. For one of them, Raymond Hoback, all that was
found was his Bible, tossing in the surf, scooped up by another
soldier trudging onward into France.
</P>
<P>
John Wilkes would never again drive down Main Street in his tan
station wagon with the wood siding, ferrying his buddies and their
dates to picnics out on Smith Mountain Lake. Elaine Coffey and Bedford
Hoback, engaged to be married after the war, would never move into
their little farm home.
</P>
<P>
Ray Stevens would not shake his brother's hand in France, and Earl
Parker would never ever see his baby daughter.
</P>
<P>
Such a high price for one small town. In 1944, Bedford had just
3,400 residents, and only one taxi driver, one undertaker and one
sheriff. It fell to them to deliver the telegrams, driving past the
farm fields rich in summer grain, the hillsides covered with loblolly
and hardwoods, the clay foothills at the break of the Blue Ridge
Mountains.
</P>
<P>
They went to the Deane home and the Schenk home and the Reynolds
home, and stopped twice at the Hobacks; they lost two sons.
</P>
<P>
Today, their names are engraved in granite on a memorial on the
lawn of the Bedford County Courthouse. The granite was carved out of a
Vierville-sur-Mer cave where the men of Company A, 116th Infantry, the
``blue and grey'' 29th Division, landed on Normandy.
</P>
<P>
There will be a modest courthouse ceremony to mark the 50th
anniversary, as there have been at other times, because even after all
these years, the grief is still borne by their loved ones in this
still small town of widows and children.
</P>
<P>
Saddest among them, perhaps, was Frank P. Draper Sr., so overcome
with sorrow that he built a large stone monument atop his son's grave
in Bedford. For Frank Jr., ``Juney'' as he called him, the father
poured out his broken heart on that marble sarcophagus:
</P>
<P>
``We loved you Juney, dearly loved you, but God loved you best.''
</P>
<P>
But even that did not cool the grief. One cold January day 20 years
ago, Frank Sr. shot himself to death. He now lies buried next to the
son he gave to France.
</P>
<P>
There had been happier times. Bedford back then was known by its
motto, the ``World's Best Little Town.''
</P>
<P>
Then came the day when Elizabeth Teass, working the Western Union
machine at Green's Drug Store, was suddenly inundated with wires that
began ``The Secretary of War regrets to inform you. ...''
</P>
<P>
This was on a Sunday morning in July, six weeks after Bedford
families were not only not getting any more letters from their
soldiers fighting in Europe, but their own letters to the men were
being sent back unopened. Something was wrong.
</P>
<P>
``Green's used to be a happy drugstore,'' Teass said about the
local hangout, a combination drugstore-diner. ``It was a lively
affair. Everybody was happy there.
</P>
<P>
``But on this particular morning, Roanoke wired that they had
casualties to give us and then they started coming. There was a crowd
gathering around, and after the wires had been delivered it was
affecting everybody.
</P>
<P>
``Everybody now was coming down to the drugstore and when it was
over, this was a calm, blue Bedford. This was a blue town. So many
young men killed.''
</P>
<P>
At the Hoback home, where the family was dressing for Sunday
services at the Center Point Methodist Church, the news came that
Bedford Hoback was dead. Soon their home was filled with parishioners
from the church across the road, offering comfort.
</P>
<P>
The next morning, while the Hoback children were cranking homemade
ice cream in the cellar for their grieving parents, they learned that
another brother, Raymond, had also been killed.
</P>
<P>
Some time later, Raymond's family Bible arrived in the mail, with a
letter from Pvt. H.W. Crayton addressed from ``Somewhere in France.''
Crayton had plucked the Bible out of the water, convinced that Raymond
was alive and probably had just dropped it in the surf.
</P>
<P>
``You have by now received a letter from your son saying he is
well,'' Crayton wrote. ``I sincerely hope so.''
</P>
<P>
So sure was he that Raymond was safe, Crayton went on to describe
the success of the invasion and the ``peaceful and quiet'' Normandy
beachfront now that the German guns had been silenced.
</P>
<P>
``The birds have begun their daily practice,'' he wrote, ``all the
flowers and trees are in bloom, and especially the poppies and tulips
which are very beautiful at this time of the year.''
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Bible, Raymond's body was never recovered.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
``It was just too much for us,'' recalled Lucille Hoback Boggess, a
sister who was just 15 at the time. ``My mother was never the same.
She later suffered a stroke and lived another 10 years but she
couldn't speak or remember anything.
</P>
<P>
``It took all of the joy out of our family. No more family picnics.
No more family get-togethers. And my mother never forgave the Germans.
Once a German missionary came to our church, and she wouldn't go see
him. It was the first time she ever refused to go to church.''

</P>
<P>
The Bedford casualties were among 197 men in the company assault
group on D-day. In all, 30 of them were from Bedford. They were
assigned to several landing craft and then launched across the English
Channel.
</P>
<P>
Roy Stevens, now 74, remembers speaking with his twin brother, Ray,
before splitting up on the landing boats. They talked about home and
Ray was shaking and he seemed convinced he wouldn't make it. Ray
suggested they shake hands goodbye. ``No,'' Roy told him. ``We'll
shake hands in France.''
</P>
<P>
Some days later, Roy was walking through a makeshift graveyard near
the beach when he stumbled across his brother's dog tags nailed to one
of the crosses. ``I saw several Bedford boys buried up there,'' he
said. ``None of them made it.''
</P>
<P>
He also remembers Earl Parker staring at his little girl's
photograph the night before D-day, and his misgivings about the
invasion. ``If I could only see my baby daughter, I wouldn't mind
dying,'' Parker told his buddies. He too perished on Normandy.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Captain Taylor N. Fellers, before the war a state highway foreman
in Bedford, skipped out of an Army hospital to make the landing. He
had earlier written home about his men: ``I'm beginning to think it's
hard to beat a Bedford boy as a soldier.''
</P>
<P>
At the beach, Fellers and his boat crew were hit by an artillery
shell that, to Bob Slaughter, a soldier from nearby Roanoke, ``looked
like it made Capt. Fellers just evaporate into thin air.''
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Ray Nance, one of the few who did return to Bedford, can still see
John Reynolds running ahead of him up the beach. ``He went down on his
knees, and he brought his rifle up as if he were searching for
something, and then he fell forward. He was dead.''
</P>
<P>
He can still hear J.D. Clifton screaming into his pack radio near
the cliffs. ``Suddenly he yelled that he'd been hit and he died.'' And
he can see John Wilkes and John Schenk taking heavy sniper fire near
their boats, cut down at the waterline.
</P>
<P>
``You know,'' Nance said, ``us Bedford boys, we competed to be in
the first wave. We wanted to be there. We wanted to be the first on
the beach.
</P>
<P>
``We got our wish.''

 Los Angeles Police Dept. Becomes a Popular Charity 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LOS ANGELES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The latest cause gaining appeal in Los Angeles is not
AIDS or the homeless or even the rain forest. It's the Los Angeles
Police Department.
</P>
<P>
With such recent offerings as cash, computers, cameras, furniture -- 
even a motor home -- donations to the LAPD in the past five months have
surpassed the tally for all of 1993.
</P>
<P>
The increase in donations, from private citizens, businesses and
other government agencies, has been attributed partly to city
officials' effort to prod the private sector into helping the city
during its fiscal crisis.
</P>
<P>
But some police officials speculate that residents and businesses
are chipping in because they feel helpless in the war against crime
and want to do their part to assist the department.
</P>
<P>
``I think it's kind of an outpouring of support predicated on the
fact that we have just been through some tumultuous experiences,''
said Al Beuerlein, who heads the department's financial support
bureau.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Police in the San Fernando Valley northwest of downtown have fared
particularly well at drawing donations over the past year, receiving
thousands of dollars worth of computers, bicycles, automobiles and
high-tech cameras used to produce extra-sharp photographs of evidence.
</P>
<P>
For example, 13 personal computers donated by Great Western Bank
are being used to help officers write crime reports. Because reports
can be written faster, police are including more details, which they
believe improves the chances of a suspect being convicted if the case
goes to trial.
</P>
<P>
``I can't even guess at the number of hours this has saved us,''
said West Valley Detective Dave Navarro.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
According to city records, 16 donations have been accepted for the
department so far this year, four more than all of last year. Because
most donations to the LAPD are goods such as used computers and cars,
police officials could not provide a cash total for offerings or a
precise breakdown of how much each station has received.
</P>
<P>
This year, the department has taken in $22,000 in cash, 41
computers, 100 cellular phones, a 1972 motor home, a 1993 Ford wagon,
office furniture and a facsimile machine, among other donations.
</P>
<P>
Leading the city's campaign to draw donations to the police are
Mayor Richard Riordan and Councilwoman Laura Chick, both of whom came
into office last July and immediately began tapping community groups
and private firms to beef up a department so fiscally strapped that
officers have not had a raise in two years and use dilapidated
equipment such as cars with more than 100,000 miles on them.
</P>
<P>
As part of Riordan's efforts to increase donations, next month the
City Council is expected to approve a special trust fund for the
Police Department to cut down on the red tape that delays the
acceptance of donations for at least two weeks until the council can
consider them. The trust fund would eliminate the requirement of
council approval for donations valued under $10,000.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
West Valley Sgt. Walt Kainz attributes most of the increase in
donations his division has garnered to Chick's efforts. They have
included turning over more than $80,000 from her office budget to the
division and giving the department three of the seven city cars
assigned to her staff.
</P>
<P>
She has also encouraged residents to make donations through the
West Valley Police Athletic League Supporters, a nonprofit booster
organization that uses cash donations to purchase equipment for the
division, Kainz said. Contributors to such organizations can get a tax
write-off.
</P>
<P>
Money donated through West Valley PALS was used to purchase a
sophisticated $700 camera that police use to photograph needle marks
on the arms of suspected drug users for use as evidence in court,
Kainz said. The camera originally used by the department was damaged
during the Northridge earthquake and the Police Department lacked the
cash to replace it, he said.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
The motivations behind the donations vary.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Duskin Co. Ltd., a cleaning-equipment rental firm
based in Osaka, Japan, said the firm donated $20,000 -- the biggest
cash donation in recent months -- to the Police Department's Asian
Crime Investigation unit because an executive vice president was
acquainted with a sergeant and wanted to help.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Rice Honda Co. loaned the LAPD two Sea-Doo watercraft,
similar to oversize jet skis, for a year to be used, in part, to make
rescues when the Los Angeles River overflows. Tim Rice, vice president
of the firm, said American Honda offers the use of its products not
only to assist police but for the publicity.
</P>
<P>
``We want the Sea-Doos to be seen out there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
In the past, the LAPD has received such unusual offerings as a
4-year-old gelding Thoroughbred named Mesa Blaze in 1992 to be used in
the department's mounted police unit.
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Jack LaLanne donated physical fitness equipment and the
use of his Pasadena gym. In 1988, American Honda donated three
all-terrain vehicles. The staff of the television show ``Hunter'' got
into the act in 1990 by donating a cellular phone.

 Banned Shooting Range Quitely Remains Open for Business (Beijing) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his plaid pants, golf shirt and sun hat, the Japanese
businessman slowly squeezed the trigger of a rocket launcher -- sending
off a sudden burst of smoke, a concussive boom and a sizable shell
into a barren mountainside a half mile away.
</P>
<P>
``Aaaaah,'' came the deep growl of satisfaction from the
middle-aged tourist as he staggered back from the weapon.
``Fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
Such thrills meant it was business as usual Friday at the China
North International Shooting Range, about an hour's drive north of
Beijing near the Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
The range is located within a weapons research center affiliated
with China North Industries Co. or Norinco, the Chinese military
conglomerate that has been making and sending to the U.S. hundreds of
thousands of weapons a year.
</P>
<P>
For those with enough money, the shooting range offers the chance
to fire anything from a small pistol to an anti-aircraft machine gun.
These arms include the Chinese-made assault rifles and handguns that
President Clinton announced Thursday he wants to ban from entry into
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Such ranges using military weaponry were ordered closed by China's
central government last year. But this one is special. While tourists
are no longer brought out here by the busload, the range has quietly
remained open for business.
</P>
<P>
This is because this range also functions as a showcase of
Norinco's smaller arms to potential bulk buyers from abroad. An
attached exhibition hall shows off the company's export line: from
``Saturday night specials'' to the cheap SKS semi-automatic rifle so
popular in the United States these days.
</P>
<P>
Exports of these and other firearms to the United States may bring
$100 million to $200 million in annual sales to Norinco and other
Chinese military firms. But those running Norinco's range claimed
Friday to know nothing of Clinton's decision to ban their products.
</P>
<P>
``This gun is not for sale here, but you might be able to get it in
America,'' the range's manager explained coyly as he pointed to an
SKS. Hundreds of thousands of these Chinese-made assault rifles were
imported by the United States last year.
</P>
<P>
China's Foreign Ministry was hardly so indirect in issuing a
statement Friday welcoming Clinton's decision to renew China's
most-favored-nation trade status, but decrying the president's
parallel move to ban U.S. imports of the Chinese-made weapons.
</P>
<P>
But on the national TV news here Friday night, the Foreign
Ministry's statement came toward the program's end after a long list
of insignificant items -- indicating the Chinese leadership may opt to
not trumpet its MFN victory domestically, likely because that could
provoke questions here about human rights.
</P>
<P>
``The current situation offers a historical opportunity for the
enhancement of Sino-American relations,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman
Wu Jianmin said. But then he called on the United States to soon
remove all remaining sanctions against China -- including the
weapons-import ban -- saying they held back good relations.
</P>
<P>
A leading Western human-rights group Friday also had a mixed
reaction, calling the president's weapons ban as good for gun control
in the United States but not for human rights in China.
</P>
<P>
``No one can be opposed to a ban on exports of guns and ammunition
to this country,'' Sidney Jones, executive director of Human Rights
Watch/Asia, said in a statement issued from New York. ``But as
pressure on China, it's meaningless. Is a ban on guns going to
persuade China to release jailed dissidents? The only big winner from
this decision is the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
``President Clinton has effectively removed all pressure on China
to improve its human rights practices,'' Jones said. ``Clinton has
left his administration looking vacillating and hypocritical, while
the Chinese leadership ... has emerged as hard-nosed, uncompromising
and victorious.''
</P>
<P>
A Beijing dissident said Friday that U.S. pressure had only gained
the release of certain well-known dissidents from jail and had not
really made much of a difference in the human-rights picture here.
</P>
<P>
``It's no use if only prison stars are released,'' Ding Zilin said.
``What about those who are not famous? There are still many people
imprisoned.''
</P>
<P>
Ding's teen-age son was among the hundreds killed in the military
crackdown on the Tiananmen Square protests five years ago. The elderly
professor has boldly carried on a one-woman campaign to compile a list
of protesters killed by the Chinese army -- a campaign that has cost
her job and brought her almost constant surveillance by security
agents.
</P>
<P>
``I welcome the help from other countries,'' she said. ``But the
real help can only be done by ourselves. ... I do see a bright future
for human rights in China someday, but it will be very hard and
slow.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
U.S. businessman, however, foresee things getting much better for
them very quickly.
</P>
<P>
With the annual MFN debate in the United States appearing to be
coming to an end with Clinton's decision to ``delink'' trade and
political issues, the U.S. businessmen are expecting rapid growth in
U.S. investment here and in Sino-American trade.
</P>
<P>
Philip S. Carmichael, president of the American Chamber of Commerce
chapter here, said Friday that planning for some large joint ventures
had been put on hold this spring until the MFN issue was settled.
This, he said, is an example of the way in which the issue put
American business at a ``competitive disadvantage'' here.
</P>
<P>
The chamber ``lauds the president's leadership in looking out for
the strategic interest of the United States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Carmichael added that the chamber had hoped that the president
would not impose any conditions for MFN renewal this year, even the
ban on Chinese guns.
</P>
<P>
But he indicated he believes the impact of the gun ban will be
minimal as Chinese weapons sales in the United States amount to less
than one percent of the more than $40 billion in annual trade between
the two countries. However, the Chinese semi-automatic rifles being
banned have become a favorite of U.S. criminals because of the
weapons' cheap price.
</P>
<P>
``Let's declare victory,'' Carmichael said, ``and move on to the
next issue.''

 Freedom to Choose Doctor Key Issue in Health Care Reform (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Jennifer Merrill faced possible surgery for a
gynecological ailment, her new insurance plan refused to pay if she
went to the specialist she had been seeing for nine years. He was not
a member of the plan.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Merrill's insurer wanted her to see a total stranger, an
obstetrician-gynecologist who is a participating provider in her
health maintenance organization.
</P>
<P>
That makes the 23-year-old Baltimore woman one of a fast-growing
number of Americans who, even before enactment of national health care
reform, are losing the freedom to choose their own doctors.
</P>
<P>
In Merrill's case, the story does not end there. She became so
uncomfortable with her new doctor that when the time came for the
$2,000 surgery, she returned to her own specialist and -- with a loan
from her grandparents -- paid the entire bill out of pocket.
</P>
<P>
Merrill's dilemma arose out of one of today's less-welcome trends
in health care: Insurance companies are aggressively imposing
restricting ``managed care'' systems on their clients.
</P>
<P>
In the name of curtailing soaring health care costs, individuals
enrolled in these systems receive maximum coverage only when they
visit participating doctors who agree to abide by price controls
negotiated with the insurer. Clients may go outside the network of
participating doctors -- but only if they pay much or, as in Merrill's
case, all of the price.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps no issue has aroused so much emotion as that of whether
Americans will be able to select their doctors. ``Choice is one of the
things people most jealously guard against erosion -- and they are
willing to pay for it,'' said Edward F. Howard, head of the
nonpartisan Alliance for Health Reform.
</P>
<P>
Critics complain that President Clinton's health reform plan would
not do enough to preserve choice -- a charge that first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton has branded as ``one of the great lies'' in the health
care debate. Clinton has said that the allegation, more than anything
else, has ``made me the maddest in the relentless campaign against
this plan.''
</P>
<P>
In fact, Clinton's prescription for change, more than any other
politically viable reform proposal, would increase choice of doctors
for most patients. ``Clinton's plan has, if anything, bent over
backward to give people the maximum choice,'' said Stanley B. Jones, a
Shepherdstown, W.Va., analyst.
</P>
<P>
But there's a catch: People would have to pay something extra for
that freedom, although hardly the full cost that Merrill and her
grandparents had to bear.
</P>
<P>
Managed care systems have grown so explosively that there are no
reliable figures on how many exist. ``Nobody can say for sure,'' said
Phil Caper, a New Hampshire physician who sells computer software
programs to managed care networks that monitor patients and doctors.
``All I know is that things have really taken off in the past few
years.''
</P>
<P>
KPMG Peat Marwick, a benefits consulting firm, says the percentage
of American workers enrolled by their employers in fee-for-service
plans -- the traditional plans that reimburse workers for a percentage
of their health costs, no matter who the doctor -- dropped from 71
percent in 1988 to just 49 percent by last year.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the percentage of private employees in managed
care systems grew from 5 percent in 1980 to 55 percent by 1992, the
government's General Accounting Office reports. That percentage is
even higher in larger firms, which have moved most aggressively in
channeling workers into managed care networks, says Derek Lifton,
associate director of Peat Marwick in Washington.
</P>
<P>
And according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, the
number of Americans enrolled in HMOs -- the most tightly run form of
managed care -- rose from 9.1 million in 1980 to 37.2 million by 1992.
The regional differences in HMO acceptance are stark: more than one in
three Californians belong, compared with 7 percent in Texas and less
than 1 percent in Alaska, Montana and Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
In all, as many as 95 percent of Americans with private insurance
are subject to some form of utilization review, possibly leading to a
denial of coverage either before or after a specific treatment,
according to Lewin-VHI Inc., a health care consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
``Fewer than half of American workers have any choice at all over
their doctors or their health care plan today,'' Clinton has said.
</P>
<P>
Why hasn't there been a huge public outcry over the loss of choice
if, as everyone says, it is such a potent consumer issue?
</P>
<P>
``I don't think the public understands how pervasive this is
becoming,'' said Dr. James Todd, executive vice president of the
American Medical Assocation.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's plan, like most other viable proposals in Congress,
contains strong financial incentives to prod consumers into managed
care systems. A central hallmark in such arrangements is the
``gatekeeper,'' a primary care physician whose permission is needed
before a patient may consult with a specialist.
</P>
<P>
So it's hardly surprising that the most vocal critics of the
erosion of choice are high-priced specialists. Last month, the
American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, for example, took out
full-page newspaper ads to clamor for ``direct (public) access to
specialty care.''
</P>
<P>
``Those pushing the issue tend to be providers who don't want to be
excluded,'' said Bill Custer, EBRI's research director.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Stephen M. Shortell, a Northwestern University management
professor, called the issue of choice -- in the context of health care
reform -- ``a red herring.''
</P>
<P>
The president's proposal, which seeks to guarantee a lifetime of
comprehensive benefits to all Americans, would increase choice by
pooling most people into regional insurance-purchasing alliances that
negotiate rates with specific groups of providers and insurers.
</P>
<P>
As an alliance member, Shortell says, ``you end up having to choose
your doctor from a panel. But in most areas, that list will be pretty
long.''
</P>
<P>
Under Clinton's proposal, each alliance must offer at least three
types of plans -- including a traditional but costlier fee-for-service
plan and an HMO with lower premiums, no deductibles and co-payments of
$10 or less per visit.
</P>
<P>
Each plan also must offer a ``point-of-service'' option, which
allows consumers to see any doctor outside the plan, but for a higher
out-of-pocket fee.
</P>
<P>
Under such arrangements, says Joseph M. Davis, president of
Medimetrix, a Cleveland-based consulting firm, consumer choice ``goes
up significantly.''
</P>
<P>
Congress is sure to make major changes in Clinton's plan. But, as
currently written, it would require employers to pay at least 80% of a
worker's premiums, with the individual paying the rest.
</P>
<P>
Administration analysts estimate that the average annual premiums
(subject to regional variations) will be $4,200 for a family of four
and $1,800 for an individual. Twenty percent of that, the consumer
share, would be $840 and $360, respectively.
</P>
<P>
For those who opt for more choice under a fee-for-service plan,
premiums, co-payments and annual deductibles will be higher, with a
cap on out-of-pocket spending of as much as $3,000 per year per
family.
</P>
<P>
``That's a high hurdle most people can't get over,'' warned the
AMA's Todd. True choice, he said, ``will depend on what that threshold
is.''
</P>
<P>
The mandatory alliance structure proposed by Clinton also would let
consumers -- rather than their employers -- pick which health plan to
join. As the president boasted last month in a speech: ``We give
choice of providers back to the employees themselves.''

 Why Ollie North `Cabaled Quietly' for a Jailed General 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the fall of 1986, Oliver North sought to save a convicted felon
from serving his federal prison sentence. The beneficiary of North's
efforts was no common criminal. His name was Jose Bueso Rosa; he was a
former Honduran general who had been actively involved in a failed
1984 plot to assassinate the president of Honduras -- a plot that was
to be funded by a $10 million cocaine deal.
</P>
<P>
It sounded like a lurid ``Miami Vice'' plot to veteran newspaper
reporters, but for Oliver North, then the deputy director of political
military affairs at the National Security Council, it was just another
day at the office.
</P>
<P>
North insisted to colleagues that Bueso deserved special treatment
because he had previously helped senior U.S. officials conduct covert
operations in support of the Contra rebels fighting in Central
America. After Bueso was sentenced to a five-year prison term in
connection with the assassination plot, North waged a wide-ranging
bureaucratic campaign in Washington to gain his freedom.
</P>
<P>
The story of North's efforts on behalf of Bueso is not just an
obscure chapter in the Iran-Contra scandal. Like shredding documents
and misleading Congress in the name of defending American values, the
leniency campaign for Bueso illuminates North's seeming inability to
distinguish between his own political interests and the requirements
of the law.
</P>
<P>
North, now a candidate for the Republican senatorial nomination in
Virginia, presents himself as a candidate who is tough on crime, who
favors the abolition of parole and who will zealously defend what he
calls ``traditional American values.''
</P>
<P>
His efforts to free a man who plotted with a convicted cocaine
conspirator to kill a democratically elected head of state suggest a
certain permissiveness in the way North puts his beliefs into action.
In the Bueso case, as in other critical junctures in the Iran-Contra
scandal, North did not let concern about the niceties of the law
interfere with the pursuit of his goals.
</P>
<P>
North declined to answer questions about the Bueso affair for this
article. He spelled out his motivation for the leniency campaign on
Sept. 17, 1986 in a White House electronic mail message to his boss,
national-security adiser John Poindexter. North expressed his concern
that Bueso, if sent to prison, might ``break his long-standing silence
about the Nic(araguan) Resistance and other sensitive operations.''
</P>
<P>
North then called together a host of senior Reagan administration
officials to ``cabal quietly,'' as he put it, on Bueso's behalf. His
behind-the-scenes pressure did not save Bueso from prison, but it did
succeed in getting him transferred to one of the most comfortable
federal correctional facilities in the country. And Bueso, whom North
feared might ``start singing songs nobody wants to hear,'' never did
speak out publicly about clandestine U.S. government operations in
Central America.
</P>
<P>
-O- 
</P>
<P>
Bueso's assistance to the U.S. government in the early 1980s was a
closely guarded secret. Only three U.S. government officials ``were
fully aware of all that (Bueso) was doing on our behalf,'' according
to a partially declassified memo written by North and obtained by the
National Security Archive, a Washington research organization.
</P>
<P>
What covert operations Bueso and North worked on together is not
known. In one of his NSC memos, North said Bueso ``was the man with
whom'' he and other top officials ``worked out arrangements. ... ''
The next three lines of the memo have been classified as top secret.
</P>
<P>
Bueso's admitted violations of U.S. law are not a secret. The FBI
announced the indictment of Bueso and three other men in November
1984. The court proceedings that resulted in the conviction of all the
defendants produced a detailed public record of the U.S. government's
evidence about their scheme.
</P>
<P>
The affair began in July 1984. Bueso traveled to Miami where he
joined four men in discussing a plot to kill the president of Honduras
and take control of the government. An FBI agent posing as an
assassin-for-hire infiltrated the plot and met Bueso at several
meetings. The FBI also wiretapped conversations of all of the
participants.
</P>
<P>
The plotter's target was Roberto Suazo, a wealthy conservative
rancher who had been elected in 1981. Suazo, though generally
supportive of U.S. policies in Central America, was regarded as a
virtual communist by several of the plotters because the Honduran
government had allegedly reneged on business deals with them.
</P>
<P>
Suazo was also no friend of Bueso's. Four months earlier, in March
1984, Suazo, under pressure from more nationalistic officers, had
acquiesced in the purging of pro-American officers, including Bueso,
from commanding positions in the Honduran armed forces.
</P>
<P>
North would later lobby for Bueso's freedom by claiming that the
Honduran man was only tangentially involved in the assassination
plotting. The evidence available to the U.S. government indicated
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
Bueso participated in at least five meetings in the summer and fall
of 1984 in which the assassination was discussed and planned,
according to the affidavit of the lead FBI agent in the case and the
wiretaps.
</P>
<P>
At one meeting, Bueso told the conspirators he did not want the
assassination to be carried out prior to Nov. 15, 1984. According to
an FBI affidavit, Bueso explained that a premature ``hit'' might cause
the country to fall into the wrong hands. Bueso also knew about the
hiring of the assassin. In early September 1984, he was present at a
meeting where the conspirators swore a blood oath to carry out the
assassination and the erstwhile hitman was paid $20,000 in cash.
</P>
<P>
The plot, according to an FBI agent's sworn testimony and wiretaps
submitted into the court record, was to be financed by a drug deal. In
early October 1984, Bueso's host in Miami, a Honduran businessman
named Faiz Sikaffy, was overheard by the undercover FBI agent
discussing a deal involving ``fish.'' The FBI agents following the
investigation believed that ``fish'' was actually a code word for
narcotics. The next day, Sikaffy agreed to pay the hit man $300,000
and 10 kilos of cocaine for carrying out the assassination, according
to an FBI agent's affidavit.
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 28, 1984, the first part of the plot was carried out. A
Cessna plane, laden with 15 duffel bags carrying 760 pounds of
cocaine, landed at a remote airfield in central Florida. FBI agents
were waiting. Over the next week all of the plotters were arrested;
Bueso, who was in Chile at the time, was arrested there.
</P>
<P>
William Webster, director of the FBI, told the press, ``We don't
want international terrorists to establish beachheads or bases for
operations in the United States such as they have enjoyed for years in
other parts of the world.''
</P>
<P>
Facing extradition from Chile, Bueso voluntarily returned to Miami
in November 1985. He was charged and released on $50,000 bail. He was
not charged with any narcotics-related offenses, and his lawyer has
denied that he knew anything about any drug deal aspect of the plot.
</P>
<P>
However, one of Bueso's conversations heard on the FBI wiretaps had
piqued the interest of federal investigators. The conversation
occurred eight days before the cocaine arrived in the United States.
Bueso called one of his fellow plotters in Miami asking for the
whereabouts of Faiz Sikaffy.
</P>
<P>
``I have some things ready but it is on a timetable,'' Bueso was
recorded as saying,. ``If he does not come on Tuesday that thing is
(expletive).''
</P>
<P>
``Uh ... the fish? ... the fish flour?'' his associate stammered.
</P>
<P>
``No ... the fish flour, yes,'' Bueso said.
</P>
<P>
``The fish flour, I think that they have it,'' the other plotter
replied. ``Uh, they are going to obtain a letter of credit. That's
what he was telling me.'' Then the conversation turned to the planning
of the assassination in Honduras.
</P>
<P>
``Our assessment was that there was insufficient evidence to join
him (Bueso) in the narcotics indictment,'' says one federal prosecutor
familiar with the case. ``From our perspective we often have that
feeling that a defendant had to have known (about drug trafficking)
but in Bueso's case we couldn't prove it. He was certainly an active
player in the plans.''
</P>
<P>
There is no evidence that North knew about the plot while it was
taking place in 1984. But it is known that Bueso was actively seeking
special treatment from Washington officials by the spring of 1986.
That was when Bueso entered into a plea-bargain agreement with federal
prosecutors in Miami. He pleaded guilty to two felony counts of
traveling in furtherance of a conspiracy. His lawyer asked for a delay
in sentencing so that he could consult with ``several highly placed
officials'' in Washington who were working on aid to the Contras.
</P>
<P>
At his sentencing hearing in July 1986, Bueso expressed ``my
profound sorrow for having been involved in this case. At the same
time, I would like to clarify that the matter was not premeditated.''
Judge Sidney Aronovitz gave Bueso a lecture on terrorism and ordered
him to report to a medium-security federal prison in Tallahassee,
Fla., on Sept. 25, 1986, to serve a five-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
-O- 
</P>
<P>
That's when North's behind-the-scenes campaign to spring Bueso
began. North was concerned that Bueso was going to feel betrayed if he
actually had to serve a substantial amount of time. As he told
Poindexter in an electronic mail message on Sept 17, 1986, Bueso was
due to report to prison in a week. ``He apparently still believed up
until yesterday that he (would) be going to the minimum-security
facility at Eglin (Air Force base in Florida) for a short period (days
or weeks) and then walk free.''
</P>
<P>
North swung into action. He told Poindexter he was going to call a
meeting of five top Reagan administration officials ``to look at
options: pardon, clemency, deportation, reduced sentence. Objective is
to keep Bueso from feeling like he was lied to in legal process.''
</P>
<P>
The next morning North reported to Poindexter that the meeting had
gone well. The plan, he said, was to get retired Gen. Paul Gorman, the
former top commander of U.S. forces in Latin America, to testify in
closed court on Bueso's behalf. Then Bueso would be released and
deported back to Honduras.
</P>
<P>
Over the next two weeks North arranged a series of meetings in
which he lobbied the upper echelons of the Reagan administration on
Bueso's behalf. Among the officials who supported his efforts,
according to a several participants in the meetings, were Gorman;
Dewey Clarridge, the head of CIA operations in Latin America; and
Elliott Abrams, assistant secretary of state for Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Gorman was not available for comment. Abrams declined to answer
questions on the matter. Clarridge, now a senior vice president at
General Dynamics in San Diego, says North's actions were appropriate.
</P>
<P>
``We considered the fact that he (Bueso) had been helpful to us in
the past. And there was a feeling he had been set up as part of some
type of overzealous, unfair sting operation. There was a real question
as to whether Bueso even had any idea what was going on at all.''
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with top State and Justice department officials on
Sept. 24, 1986, North argued that Bueso was only tangentially involved
in the assassination plot, according to a deposition given to
congressional investigators by a senior Justice Department official.
North proposed that Bueso be released and deported to Honduras.
</P>
<P>
Oliver ``Buck'' Revell, then deputy director of the FBI, who also
attended the meeting, objected. The FBI was determined not to get
involved in the ``manipulation of the case or attempting to get the
charges dropped,'' says Revell, now special agent in charge of the FBI
office in Dallas. ``There was no way we could do something for someone
who had been involved in drug trafficking aimed against the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
North refused to give up. In early October 1986, he called another
meeting trying to get higher-ranking officials at the State Department
and the Justice Department to change their position in favor of
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Again, North, Clarridge and Gorman attended, and all spoke in favor
of letting Bueso go free. But the Justice Department representative at
the meeting, deputy assistant attorney general Mark Richard, resisted.
Richard asked North to explain why Bueso merited special treatment.
North's answer, according to a deposition Richard gave to
investigators for the congressional Iran-Contra committee in 1987, was
``very ambiguous'' and included ``no specifics.''
</P>
<P>
``I said, `Look ... anything we do for this man seems to undercut
our position that we have taken repeatedly that this man is an
international terrorist,' '' Richard testified. ``This is certainly
not consistent with the position we have articulated throughout the
course of this prosecution that this man is a serious international
terrorist and should be treated accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department did make one concession to North. It acted
on North's request that Bueso be transferred from the medium-security
prison at Tallahassee to a minimum security at Eglin Air Force base in
Florida, known as ``Club Fed'' for its comfortable cabins and
volleyball courts.
</P>
<P>
Bueso began serving his sentence there on Oct. 9, 1986. After
serving a total of 40 months (including time served before his
conviction), Bueso became eligible for parole and was released in May
1989, according to Bureau of Prisons records. Bueso is now retired and
living in Honduras.
</P>
<P>
What does North's campaign to free Bueso in 1986 have to do with
his effort to get elected to the U.S. Senate in 1994?
</P>
<P>
Nothing, according to a spokesman for the North campaign who said,
``It's old news and garbage and nobody cares about it.''
</P>
<P>
William Webster, the director of the FBI when Bueso was arrested
and later the director of the CIA, has a different view of the Bueso
affair.
</P>
<P>
``Information about past assistance to an agency of government can
be supplied to the sentencing judge but the balancing responsibility
lies with the court,'' says Webster, now a senior partner at the law
firm of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley and McCloy. ``It's important that
loyalty or zeal not short-circuit the criminal-justice process.'' The
judicial process was not short-circuited in the Bueso affair -- but not
for lack of trying on the part of the would-be junior senator from
Virginia.

 Solzhenitsyn Speaks Out (Vladivostok) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
VLADIVOSTOK, Russia
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Russian writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn lost no
time Saturday, 24 hours after his return from two decades of exile in
the West, in speaking his mind, often quite sharply, about his
much-altered country.
</P>
<P>
In his first formal news conference on Russian soil, the
75-year-old Nobel Prize winner criticized the economic reforms of
President Boris Yeltsin as ``brainless,'' called ultranationalist
Vladimir Zhirinovsky a ``caricature of a patriot'' and said that
swaths of independent Kazakhstan were actually Russia. He also labeled
the political system here a ``pseudo-democracy.''
</P>
<P>
Solzhenitsyn, who has never shied from controversy, has made
similar statements in the West, where he was sent by Soviet rulers in
1974 for his defiance. But his words are taking on added meaning now
that he is back in Russia and can easily be heard and seen for the
first time by his compatriots.
</P>
<P>
He is widely respected here, but whether his opinions will carry
more weight than those of any other prominent person is an open
question. If today was any indication, many of Yeltsin's moderate
nationalist critics will be quite content with what Solzhenitsyn has
to say, while others on both the left and right may be less happy.
</P>
<P>
Solzhenitsyn said he does not intend to get involved with politics,
either through election or appointment. But he will try to ``help our
homeland in these extremely difficult conditions by public activity,
through meetings, by persuasion and through my articles. Of course, I
will speak as much as I can.''
</P>
<P>
Residents here seemed delighted that the famous writer was in their
midst and were willing to listen to what he had to say. ``People
respect him, so he'll have some influence, of course, but how much
depends on how he acts,'' said Nikolai Shemetov, 45, a mechanic at a
local power station.
</P>
<P>
Solzhenitsyn pointedly avoided direct criticism of Yeltsin despite
several questions about the Russian leader, who sent him a
welcome-home telegram Saturday. Solzhenitsyn supported Yeltsin in the
Russian leader's past political crises, including last year's battles
with the now-disbanded hard-line parliament.
</P>
<P>
Saturday, however, he had nothing good to say about the changes in
Russia under Yeltsin's rule, except to applaud the collapse of
communism and Soviet power.
</P>
<P>
He particularly took issue with Yeltsin's economic policies, which
he said he had followed closely through news accounts and
conversations from his home in Vermont. He said he had become
convinced that the reforms, including the controversial program to
privatize state property, had done nothing more than enrich a few and
impoverish many.
</P>
<P>
Solzhenitsyn's first-hand survey this morning of the new Russian
economic world, at an outdoor market overflowing with food and
clothing, did not seem to alter his opinion. Like many Russians, he
appeared shocked by the high prices in comparison to 20 years ago and
seemed less impressed that so much more is available now than before.
When he commented on the high prices to one merchant, the man
responded that because of inflation ``the prices will be even higher
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
As was the case on Friday, when he arrived in this naval port city
from the United States, Solzhenitsyn was besieged everywhere he went
by well over 100 local and foreign journalists, eager to monitor his
every statement and reaction.
</P>
<P>
Some Russians have suggested that Solzhenitsyn himself has created
the commotion, by beginning his return to Russia here in Vladivostok
rather than in Moscow, which is much more accustomed to celebrities.
But Saturday he complained bitterly about the constant swarm of
reporters, saying it had made it impossible for him to meet with and
talk to ordinary Russians, his most important goal over the next few
months. The family will travel slowly across Russia to Moscow in an
effort to get reacquainted with the country.
</P>
<P>
Solzhenitsyn has been so harried by the media that one of his best
moments so far, according to his sons, was when he and his entourage
got stuck in an elevator at the Vladivostok City Hospital for 20
minutes with the head of the medical facility.
</P>
<P>
``There was no noise; no one was there,'' Solzhenitsyn said. ``I
learned a lot.''

 Palestinians Have Self-Rule But Lack Money (Beit Hanina, West Bank) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BEIT HANINA, West Bank
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Inside the nerve center for Palestinian
economic revival, Deputy Managing Director Hasan Abu Libdeh is waiting
for the phone to ring.
</P>
<P>
In fact, he's still waiting for the phone to be installed. So far,
the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction,
the agency set up to translate billions of dollars in foreign aid into
jobs and prosperity for Palestinian self-rule, does not have a single
telephone line.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians say Israel's military government in the West Bank
is blocking their request for telephones. The military government says
it is a problem of poor West Bank infrastructure. Either way, it is a
clue to the uncertainty swirling around the ambitious dreams of
Palestinian economic renewal and the global rescue plan that is
supposed to make it happen.
</P>
<P>
After the self-rule accord was signed last September between Israel
and the Palestine Liberation Organization, nations around the world
promised to help the nascent Palestinian Authority rebuild after 27
years of Israeli occupation. At a U.S.-sponsored conference in
Washington, $2.1 billion was pledged to the Palestinians over five
years, including $600 million for the first year.
</P>
<P>
Seven months later, the global rescue program is looking more like
a mirage. So far, only a tiny fraction of the money has trickled in.
And now that the Palestinians and Israelis have started to implement
their agreement, the Palestinians are facing enormous financial
problems that they are woefully unprepared to solve.
</P>
<P>
For now, Palestinians in the street are still celebrating the
arrival of their own police force in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank
town of Jericho. But the best and brightest Palestinian technocrats
are deeply worried about what will happen when the celebrations fade,
when the people on the street discover that the government under their
own flag cannot deliver the same services that the Israeli occupiers
did.
</P>
<P>
``We'll be drinking a lot of unsweetened coffee,'' said Libdeh.
``It will be the real life.''
</P>
<P>
The reasons why the money has not yet started flowing from abroad
are complex and help illuminate the uncertain nature of the new
Palestinian experiment. PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, who
single-handedly controlled the finances of his revolutionary
organization for three decades, has not yielded to the demands of the
World Bank and donor nations that he give up his old methods when
running the new Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
While Arafat has made some concessions under pressure,
authoritative sources said he has not given up his desire to run
everything. Worried about corruption, as well as about political
favoritism, the international donors have not yet made good on their
major pledges.
</P>
<P>
According to these sources -- including Palestinians and Western
diplomats familiar with the events -- the whole concept of a
coordinated, global aid effort to the Palestinians may be stalling.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the sources report, Arafat is actively looking for ways to
bypass the World Bank by dealing directly with individual companies
and countries for lucrative projects in Gaza and Jericho. This system
would help preserve his central role, without the headache of
restrictions being imposed by international donors.
</P>
<P>
The sources said British, American, French, German and Danish firms
quietly have been beating a path to PLO headquarters in Tunis
recently, with the approval or acquiescence of their governments,
seeking contracts for long-term development projects such as printing
a new currency, building a new telephone system and constructing
airports and an electric system.
</P>
<P>
``The reasons the donors are going to Tunis are the same reasons
Israel decided to go there: That's where the decisions are made,'' one
diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian economic council here, based just outside
Jerusalem, was originally intended to channel the aid from abroad into
useful projects in the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
But for months the international donors complained the council was
not adequately set up to avoid abuse. Recently, the council's bylaws
were approved, and six top officials were given six-month
reappointments, including several prominent Palestinian economists.
Last week, Arafat also selected the U.S.-based investment bank Morgan
Stanley to help manage the reconstruction efforts, according to the
Palestinian news agency Wafa.
</P>
<P>
But the big money has not started flowing, and there is a growing
fear that it may never materialize on the scale promised.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian economic council ``is doing some good work,'' said
another Western aid expert, ``but the question still lingers: Who is
the genuine authority?''
</P>
<P>
While some countries are anxious to win lucrative contracts, they
are loath to pour money into an organization that will be exclusively
controlled by Arafat, he said. The suspicion is strong among donors
that Arafat, if left to his own devices, will channel aid to political
friends in the territories-for example, that he will build health
clinics to reward operatives in his Fatah movement, rather than where
the clinics are needed.
</P>
<P>
There is also a reverse suspicion: The Palestinians complain that
foreign donors are only interested in projects that look good back
home, with a plaque on the front door, rather than let Palestinians
build what they want. But the Palestinians admit they are not in a
position to turn anyone down.
</P>
<P>
In the near term, the Palestinians are heading for an economic
upheaval. The Israelis have turned over to them health, education and
other government departments in Gaza and Jericho, but the 7,000
workers' salaries have been paid only through June 1. After that, the
Palestinians have to begin running their own government -- and they are
short of cash.
</P>
<P>
The new Palestinian national authority has about $19 million in a
special emergency fund, officials said. But after a few months, it
will be severely strained. During the occupation, Israel spent about
$70 million a year to provide services in what are now the self-rule
areas of Gaza and Jericho; by most accounts, the Palestinians will
need two or three times that amount, since they must support police as
well. Already, thousands of Palestinian policemen in Gaza and Jericho
are unpaid and sleeping on mattresses; Israel recently donated
military rations to keep them from going hungry.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have been given the authority to set tax rates and
collect taxes. But all the Palestinian workers in the tax department
of the Israeli military government resigned six years ago at the
beginning of the intifada , or uprising against Israeli occupation. In
addition, the Palestinians lack expertise to run the computerized tax
system left behind by Israel, which is entirely in Hebrew, said Elise
Shazar, spokeswoman for the military government.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it is not at all certain that Palestinians in Gaza -- 
already hard-pressed by high unemployment and Israel's closure of the
territories -- will be willing to pay taxes to the new authority.
Palestinians estimate it may take months to begin to generate revenues
and that the collection rate may be only 40 percent of what is sought.
While tax revenue is supposed to also come from Palestinian workers in
Israel, so far Israel has only permitted a trickle to return to their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
The result will be a skyrocketing deficit for day-to-day needs the
first year, perhaps $150 million or more. The Palestinians are hoping
the international donors will decide soon pick up the tab. But a
senior Israeli official, who spoke to reporters on condition he not be
identified, was skeptical.
</P>
<P>
``We know that the international community is insisting on specific
projects to support,'' he said. ``They don't want to pay for daily
expenses. If everyone is stalling and there is no money for expenses,
the whole thing may collapse.
</P>
<P>
``It's going to become our problem in no time,'' said the official.
``And then what?''

 Feud in Capital Harms Drug Plane Interception Program (Washn)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An unresolved feud in the Clinton administration,
which abruptly cut off Peru and Colombia from access to U.S.
counter-drug intelligence, has blinded all three nations to the
flights of drug smuggling aircraft and threatened to fracture a
brittle alliance against the northward flow of drugs.
</P>
<P>
The sudden halt in cooperation has created a significant
opportunity for traffickers, according to civilian and military
narcotics experts.
</P>
<P>
Relatively few drug flights have ever been intercepted, but data on
their origin and destination has set the stage for raids on drug labs
and storage facilities that netted some 300 metric tons of contraband
last year.
</P>
<P>
Because the State and Defense Departments could not agree on a
policy and failed to coordinate their moves, Peru and Colombia
received no warning and scant explanation of the May 1 intelligence
cutoff. On that day, the U.S. Southern Command suspended operation of
U.S. ground-based radars in those countries and stopped allowing their
nationals aboard U.S. surveillance flights launched from Panama.
</P>
<P>
The two South American nations have begun to retaliate. Peru has
banned the American AWACS and P-3 surveillance craft from its air
space, and Colombia threatened in writing last week to expel two U.S.
mobiground radars.
</P>
<P>
At issue is the use of American flight tracking data by Colombia
and Peru to locate and then force down or shoot down suspected drug
planes. The United States has long regarded any attack on civil
aircraft as illegal under international conventions and detrimental to
U.S. interests as the world's leading aviation power, but it sometimes
has winked at quiet efforts against drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon, supported by the Justice Department and a recent
review by lawyers for eight government agencies, maintains that
assisting in the shootdowns breaks U.S. and international law. Senior
State Department officials, while acknowledging what one called
``legal concerns,'' want to continue some form of a policy under which
the United States would share the tracking data but express its
official disapproval of attacks in flight.
</P>
<P>
Beyond the legal concerns, the Defense Department worries about the
possibility that the two South American nations will down innocent
aircraft by accident.
</P>
<P>
Days after U.S. F-15 fighters shot down two American helicopters in
northern Iraq, Defense Undersecretary Frank G. Wisner wrote on April
20 to Undersecretary of State Peter Tarnoff. ``Recent events in
Iraq,'' said his classified letter, underscored the need to protect
innocent aircraft. The Defense Department would stop the intelligence
sharing on May 1, he wrote, unless Colombia and Peru agreed not to use
weapons against aircraft in flight.
</P>
<P>
What threw the interagency dispute into crisis was its uncommon
rancor and the willingness of U.S. adversaries to let it spill out
into relations with Colombia and Peru. Noteworthy because it
accompanies new claims of bureaucratic peace within the Clinton
administration, the policy feud has ``descended into hatred,''
according to one senior participant.
</P>
<P>
Defense Department officials charge that the State Department
deliberately failed to provide advance notice of the May 1 cutoff to
Peru and Colombia -- or even to U.S. ambassadors there -- in order to
create maximum backlash. When the two countries protested, one
Colombian diplomat said a State Department contact told him the
Defense Department cut off the aircraft intelligence ``unilaterally''
and that the military ``didn't even tell the State Department about
it.''
</P>
<P>
In a remarkable suggestion that one U.S. official likened to
``treason,'' the same State Department official even encouraged
Colombia to lodge a strong protest, according to the Colombian
diplomat and another U.S. official with knowledge of the conversation.
</P>
<P>
``I have been through a lot in 27 years of service,'' wrote Alvin
Adams, U.S. ambassador in Peru, in a classified May 3 cable to
complain that he received no word in advance. ``Of the little I can
remember in my advanced middle age, this is -- in my ken of experience
 -- a standout.'' Adams asked ``urgently for coordinated guidance from
you.''
</P>
<P>
In Washington, two of the principal adversaries, Assistant
Secretary of State Robert S. Gelbard and Deputy Assistant Secretary of
Defense Brian E. Sheridan, each in charge of counter-narcotics policy
for his department, are said to be not on speaking terms. State
Department officials, according to sources there and on Capitol Hill,
have told congressional Republicans that the Pentagon is trying to
walk away from the war on drugs. One State Department official, who
provided a reporter with the names of Republicans to call, said he
worried that there might be an ``unfortunate perception'' that the
Clinton administration is ``in full retreat on narcotics.''
</P>
<P>
``We are trying to understand what is going on inside the American
government,'' said a frustrated Peruvian official. ``We are waiting
for the discussions between the agencies to come to a consensus.''
</P>
<P>
The importance of the small aircraft to drug traffickers is not in
dispute. Coca leaf grown in Bolivia and Peru must move northward for
processing in successive stages to cocaine paste, cocaine base and -- 
in Colombia -- the pure street drug. Because dense jungle prevents
overland transport and the rivers flow mainly east-west, the
traffickers have what one U.S. general called ``a north-south
problem.''
</P>
<P>
U.S. intelligence officials believe nearly 1,000 flights a year
head north carrying some form of cocaine or heroin. Since the late
1980s the United States has provided the backbone of an air tracking
network capable of detecting and intercepting the flights.
</P>
<P>
The idea, officially, was to pinpoint the where the planes took off
and landed and ``fuse'' that information with other intelligence in
order to mount ground attacks on drug labs and storage facilities. The
ambitions of Peru and Colombia to down the aircraft in flight were
largely hypothetical until recently, when Peruvian Tucano trainer
aircraft armed with machine guns began shooting effectively at the
renegade flights.
</P>
<P>
Peru brought the issue into the open Nov. 4 with a dramatic
shootdown of a suspected drug plane near Pucallpa, Peru. Shortly after
that, Colombia announced its intention to shoot down drug flights.
</P>
<P>
State Department officials argue that the air traffic is so
important to the drug trade that the United States cannot afford to
remove the threat that narcotics planes will be shot down. Gen. Barry
R. McCaffrey, chief of the U.S. Southern Command, also supported the
shootdown policy until its legal implications became clear.
</P>
<P>
But other officials, including a senior Drug Enforcement Agency
expert, said interceptions of drugs in flight are a minor part of the
drug war. Official Pentagon statistics, undisputed elsewhere in the
government, show that 200 kilograms of cocaine were forced down last
year while 300 metric tons were seized by other means in Colombia and
Peru.
</P>
<P>
Far more important than the flight interceptions, officials said,
are the hard-won cooperative relationships with Colombia and Peru.
With the Clinton administration still deadlocked, those relationships
now appear to be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
``The U.S. cannot decide what we do in our air space,'' said an
angry Colombian official in a telephone interview. ``That's a
sovereign decision and we're not going to change it. If the U.S.
doesn't cooperate with us, we'll request its radars to be withdrawn.''
</P>
<P>
Said a U.S. government official, expressing anger against his
Pentagon and State Department counterparts, ``Why could these children
not come together and work this out? The real reason we can't fight
effectively against the narcotraffickers is that we're too busy
fighting among ourselves.''

 Rwandan War Dead Wash Ashore in Uganda (Malembo, Uganda) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MALEMBO, Uganda
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is where their journey ends, far from home,
their bodies carried by the Kagera River out of Rwanda and into
Africa's greatest lake, Victoria, to be caught like perch by peasant
fishermen.
</P>
<P>
They have traveled more than 100 miles, over thundering falls and
along fertile savannas, by the time the Kagera rages into Lake
Victoria at Kasensero. It is near that little town that Jamil Kakora
waits each morning, his boat loaded with plastic bags instead of
fishing tackle.
</P>
<P>
By the time he and his five-man crew returned to shore about noon
Saturday, a ghastly collection of limbs and torsos filled the boat.
The fishermen, donning masks and gloves, worked quickly to wrap and
tie the bodies, and to load them into the trailer of a red tractor
parked nearby.
</P>
<P>
``We heard about the war on the radio,'' Kakora said, ``so we knew
the bodies were coming. We had a meeting in the village and agreed:
You cannot leave these people to just float in the lake. Even if they
died like dogs in Rwanda, they deserve to be buried like humans. We
all said yes, this is something we must do.''
</P>
<P>
As many as 40,000 bodies, relief specialists say, have washed into
this giant lake that provides an abundance of Nile perch and tilapia
for fish markets from Kampala to London, as well as drinking water for
scores of primitive villages scattered along its shores.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the victims of the most extensive massacre in
modern Africa's post-independence history appear to be women and
children. Some who reach Lake Victoria apparently were beheaded.
Others' arms were tied behind their backs. One cluster of infants
washed downstream in a tied sack. Three others were joined by a single
pointed stick thrust through their stomachs.
</P>
<P>
International aid workers estimate that between 200,000 and 500,000
people have been killed in Rwanda since the country's president died
in a plane crash April 6 and Hutu-dominated government troops and
militiamen began an orgy of murder, primarily against members of the
minority Tutsi tribe. Two million Rwandans have fled across the border
to neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Although Kenya has dismissed any threat from the decomposing bodies
to its portion of Lake Victoria, Uganda has told its people not to
drink the lake's water until further tests are made and to boil all
fish taken from Victoria for at least 30 minutes. Health officials
also are concerned that cholera could be spread by the flies that
descend in thick swarms on the bodies.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
The first bodies the villagers pulled from the lake were buried in
shallow graves a few yards from the shore. They were dug up by dogs
and pigs and lay uncovered for several days, along with the rubbish
and human waste that the people of Malembo routinely deposit at the
water's edge. Health officials feared an outbreak of disease could
result.
</P>
<P>
World Vision, a U.S. relief and development agency, was already
active in the region when the bodies began pouring into Lake Victoria.
Its work dealt primarily with 160,000 children orphaned in the region
by AIDS -- the leading cause of death in rural Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Malembo is tucked away on the shoreline swamps of the Nassara
Plain, 20 miles from any road other than a footpath. The village has
no running water or electricity, and most of the 800 inhabitants have
concerns other than examining the daily cargo of the body-hunting
fishermen who are paid $6 a day by World Vision.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Only a handful of people were on the shore Saturday as the
tractor's trailer began to fill with bodies. John Marembo, the local
defense secretary and also the village's record-keeper, stood by the
tractor, dutifully recording in his notebook the number of bodies
retrieved for the day ... 18, 19, 20. ...
</P>
<P>
``It is awful enough that Rwanda should have a war like this,''
Marembo said. ``It is also very bad they should give us their litter
from the war.''
</P>
<P>
When the trailer was full, a barefoot man climbed onto the tractor
and drove to a dusty clearing a mile away, a mass grave site bought
from a local farmer for $80.

<P>
Joseph Kasozi and John Kastunga waited there, shirtless and
sweating in the fierce sun. Along with five others, they had dug a
huge grave, as long and high as a bus. They were eating sugar cane
stalks. Six other large graves shoveled out earlier in the week were
already filled, covered with earth and marked by a cross of twigs
lashed together by twine.
</P>
<P>
The bodies were thrown into the pit and covered with a liquid
chemical, to become nameless wartime victims whose families will never
be able to fully explain their fate. As the workers shoveled in earth,
up the path toward the clearing came the village's lay priest, John
Lubega.
</P>
<P>
He wore a cross carved from a bone around his neck and had no
shoes. He was reciting: ``Oh, Lord in heaven, help the souls of these
people. They are the accidents of war. We ask you, please intervene
and stop the war so people may stop dying.''

 U.S.-China Relations May Still Be in for Rocky Times (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Clinton chose to back away from a human
rights confrontation with China to avoid a damaging rift with one of
the world's great economic and military powers. But what is likely to
ensue now, many experts in and out of government acknowledge, is far
from a period of tranquil relations.
</P>
<P>
In fact, now that the dispute over China's most-favored-nation
trading status is finally being resolved, a number of other conflicts
are likely to boil to the surface. Many of these have been suppressed
or delayed by the Clinton administration's preoccupation with the
trade dispute.
</P>
<P>
In other words, relations between the United States and China are
shaky enough that all the efforts expended on the trade dispute may
produce only very fragile, short-term gains.
</P>
<P>
``Even if the president were to say, `I'm giving MFN to China for
five years,' it's Pollyannish to think everything else will be taken
care of,'' one U.S. official observed recently.
</P>
<P>
``We will stop focusing on one debate and start focusing on
others,'' the official said. ``It's just going to go on. There are
still a lot of other issues that need to be worked out, and they're
not even going to be addressed until MFN gets out of the headlines.''
</P>
<P>
Over the next few months, the Clinton administration is likely to
challenge China by moving ahead with other trade sanctions that it has
threatened as retaliation for China's pirating of American tapes,
compact discs, movies and computer software. While the American
business community opposed Clinton's linkage of human rights and
China's trade status, it also strongly supports a tough stand on these
copyright and piracy issues.
</P>
<P>
Over the next year or two, the United States and China are also
likely to clash over China's continuing nuclear tests, which are
likely to resume soon.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the United States could well find itself complaining
again about China's arms exports. And China will haggle with the
United States over the future of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
and the terms for its membership in the new World Trade Organization,
the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
</P>
<P>
That list of disputes does not even include other, possibly more
contentious controversies, such as those over North Korea's nuclear
program and the future of Cambodia, still torn by civil war despite a
1991 peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
Once the trade and human rights linkage is behind them, however,
Clinton administration officials are likely to try hard to upgrade
ties with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
``My guess is that after MFN, they are going to go into a
full-court press to improve relations with China,'' said former U.S.
Ambassador to China James R. Lilley. ``They're going to move fast and
hard. We've got important interests in North Korea and Cambodia, and
we could use China's help.''
</P>
<P>
As part of that effort, Washington sources said, the administration
is expected to announce soon the appointment of a new envoy to China.
The likely candidate is a veteran China specialist, Charles W. Freeman
Jr., now assistant secretary of defense, who served during the early
1980s as deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. China experts point to recent trends that suggest that
separating the trade and human rights issues may not ease frictions
between Washington and Beijing for long.
</P>
<P>
Only a year ago, with much less fanfare than last week, Clinton
``de-linked'' the issues of arms proliferation and China's trade
benefits.
</P>
<P>
Before Clinton took office, President Bush had repeatedly vetoed
legislation that would have required China, before winning a renewal
of its trade privileges, to make progress not only on human rights but
also on curbing its arms exports and reducing its trade imbalance with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Clinton enshrined the linkage between most-favored trade benefits
and human rights in an executive order a year ago. But at the same
time, he dropped the conditions on arms exports and the trade
imbalance, saying that these problems could be dealt with through
other means.
</P>
<P>
So what happened? The administration felt obliged to prove that,
even without most-favored trade linkage, it could take tough action
against the proliferation of weapons and missiles. Last August, as
punishment for China's sale of missile technology to Pakistan, the
United States imposed sanctions barring the sale of American-made
satellites to China.
</P>
<P>
(Optional Add End)
</P>
<P>
``They (administration officials) de-linked trade and arms control
last year, but the result afterward was a downward trend in the
relationship,'' one U.S. official said. ``And I'm afraid that, to
prove that they still care about human rights, they'll do things now
on human rights that will ring off even more bells in Beijing than MFN
linkage, such as actions to upgrade ties with Taiwan and Tibet.''
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in the first 24 hours after Clinton announced that China's
most-favored trade benefits would be renewed, top administration
officials began to suggest that the president might take other actions
on human rights that could produce new frictions between Washington
and Beijing.
</P>
<P>
``I think that, in the future, we'll be keeping steady pressure on,
through other instruments, in a way that may cause (Chinese officials)
to make more progress in the future,'' Secretary of State Warren
Christopher said. ``We're certainly not giving up on improvement in
human rights in China.''

 Solzhenitsyn Feted on Return to Russia (Vladivostok) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
VLADIVOSTOK, Russia
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the first day of a cross-country tour to
rediscover his Russian homeland, Alexander I. Solzhenitsyn visited a
hospital Saturday. As the famous author stepped into an elevator, a
small crowd of doctors and a television film crew jammed in with him.
</P>
<P>
Instead of going up to the director's office on the sixth floor,
the overloaded elevator sank part way between the lobby and the
basement and stuck there for 15 minutes before a mechanic came to the
rescue.
</P>
<P>
Aside from the hazards of everyday life here, the mishap reflected
the quandary of Solzhenitsyn's identity as he returns from two decades
of exile to help post-Soviet Russia find itself. Is he an intellectual
or a celebrity? Can't he have peace to search for new truths, or must
he put up with media stardom and intrusive fans?
</P>
<P>
And how long can the 75-year-old Nobel laureate depend for special
protection on a government he criticizes so fiercely?
</P>
<P>
Solzhenitsyn spelled out his controversial views on Russia's ills
at a wide-ranging news conference, insisting that there is no real
democracy or economic reform here, no cleansing of the communist
legacy and too much imitation of the West.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
He was equally passionate about his privacy.
</P>
<P>
``I would prefer not to have 200 photographers crowding around me
all the time and shooting me day after day,'' he said. ``I need to
talk to the common people ... to learn in detail about life in
Russia.''
</P>
<P>
To be more specific, he said he resents the fact that somebody in
the crowd stepped on his wife's foot after their triumphant landing
here Friday on a flight from Alaska. ``When it's enough for each
photographer to take two shots, why take 250?''
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
After greeting doctors and eye surgery patients at the Territorial
Clinical Hospital, Solzhenitsyn rode to the city's Pacific port, where
he was greeted by a navy band playing a lively classical medley,
well-wishers pressing for autographs and more cameras.
</P>
<P>
Strolling down a waterfront aisle of merchants selling food from
truck-sized freight containers, the writer acted the part of a modern
Rip Van Winkle just awakened from a 20-year nap.
</P>
<P>
``How much is that?'' he asked a man selling sausages.
</P>
<P>
``10,000 rubles,'' the merchant replied. About $5 a kilogram.
</P>
<P>
``I don't get it,'' Solzhenitsyn said, touching his long beard and
appearing amazed. ``When I left the country many years ago, prices
were very different.''
</P>
<P>
``Come again soon, sir,'' the merchant said with a laugh, ``and
I'll sell it to you for an even higher price!''
</P>
<P>
Plainclothes police officers locked arms in a protective ring
around Solzhenitsyn and his wife as they walked, while uniformed cops
stopped people at random to inspect purses and shopping bags.
</P>
<P>
``While he's here, we will keep him under guard whether he likes it
or not,'' said Igor P. Lebedinets, the acting territorial governor.
``We're mobilizing hundreds of men.''
</P>
<P>
Later, Solzhenitsyn was driven in a black government Volga sedan to
have lunch aboard one of the two luxury rail cars sent from Moscow by
the Railway Ministry for his trans-Siberian journey to the Russian
capital. The cars, equipped with a kitchen and Oriental carpets, will
carry his entourage of family, friends, chefs, attendants, security
police and a British Broadcasting Corp. documentary film crew.
</P>
<P>
Solzhenitsyn said the 5,700-mile rail journey, which will take
several weeks, will allow him to make many stops and to ``see things
through the window.'' He said he last saw Siberia from a prison van
during his eight years in Stalin's gulag after World War II -- the
seminal experience for his powerful writings against the Soviet
system.
</P>
<P>
The lavish official hospitality by the current authorities prompted
one Russian journalist to ask Solzhenitsyn about comparisons to Maxim
Gorky, the writer brought back from Italian exile under Stalin.
</P>
<P>
``Gorky came back to serve the regime,'' Solzhenitsyn replied. ``I
will never serve the regime, whatever government is in power.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional Add End)
</P>
<P>
But he refrained from criticizing Russian President Boris N.
Yeltsin, who sent a congratulatory telegram saying: ``Your talent and
your experience as a historian and thinker will help us all in
reorganizing Russia.''
</P>
<P>
The writer did, however, repeat many criticisms he had made abroad
about the Yeltsin government's attempts at reform.
</P>
<P>
For example, he described the 1992 decisions to free prices and
sell off state property without breaking up monopolies as
``brainless'' steps that had made a country already wrecked by the
communists even poorer. He called Russia a ``pseudodemocracy'' that
still lacks local self-rule, has failed to punish the crimes of Soviet
repression and blindly imitates Western ways unsuited to its culture.
</P>
<P>
While Solzhenitsyn denied any political ambitions, his more
measured Russia-first views are likely to strike a powerful chord as
he travels and speaks across the country.
</P>
<P>
``The atmosphere in the hospital changed in one minute after he
came,'' said Yelizaveta B. Pyatina, 58, a patient there. ``Everybody
began smiling and talking about books, politics, history. We all
forgot about our ailments.''

 Rostenkowski May Reject Plea Bargain; Faces Indictment (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D -- Ill., has signaled that he
intends to reject any plea bargain and vigorously contest anticipated
charges that he abused his office by diverting public money for
personal use, associates of the powerful lawmaker said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Unless Rostenkowski should have a last-minute change of mind,
federal prosecutors are expected to seek a grand jury indictment early
this week, possibly Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
``He's not giving up, he's going to fight it,'' one associate said
of the 18-term congressman.
</P>
<P>
Other sources said Rostenkowski was reluctant to resign from
Congress, which acceptance of a plea agreement would involve, and
admit to a series of felonies that would permanently scar a Capitol
Hill career of more than 35 years.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Rostenkowski said Saturday that he had no immediate
comment on the matter.
</P>
<P>
According to federal sources, an indictment is likely to allege
that Rostenkowski defrauded taxpayers of hundreds of thousands of
dollars through both his Washington and Chicago offices.
</P>
<P>
That sum would include cash he allegedly received improperly from
the House of Representatives' post office in transactions disguised as
stamp purchases, and government funds misused to buy furniture and
gifts for friends and constituents, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Once indicted, Rostenkowski, 66, would have to step down as
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee under House Democratic
rules, but he still could remain as a member of the tax-writing panel,
which has been considering President Clinton's health care plan. If he
were acquitted of the charges, he could then regain his chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski's lawyers have advised him that a plea agreement would
enable him to avoid the humiliation of a public trial and the prospect
of conviction and a prison sentence longer than the one-year term
understood to be part of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
However, Rostenkowski, who is represented chiefly by Robert S.
Bennett, one of Washington's most skilled defense attorneys, probably
could force a delay of any trial until after the congressional
elections in November, legal sources said.
</P>
<P>
His decision to contest the anticipated charges, pending a change
of heart, scuttles three weeks of intensive negotiations between
Bennett and U.S. Attorney Eric Holder, a Clinton administration
appointee who inherited the two-year investigation last fall from his
Republican predecessor, Jay Stephens.
</P>
<P>
One source said Holder has been given full authority to proceed
with the case as he sees fit without intervention by Attorney General
Janet Reno or high-ranking Justice Department aides. Holder sent an
outline of the proposed charges to the Justice Department late last
month.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
An indictment of Rostenkowski likely would include allegations that
he:
</P>
<P>
-- Illegally converted stamps to cash for his personal use through
the House post office between 1985 and 1991. Former House Postmaster
Robert V. Rota, who pleaded guilty to charges last July and would be a
key trial witness for the prosecution, has alleged he improperly
transferred $21,000 to Rostenkowski.
</P>
<P>
-- Misused official funds to buy expensive gifts for friends from the
House office-supply service. In an admission of wrongdoing,
Rostenkowski has already reimbursed Congress about $82,000 for office
supplies purchased by his office over a period of six years.
</P>
<P>
-- Converted government-leased autos to his personal ownership.
</P>
<P>
-- Improperly used government funds to pay a number of so-called
``ghost employees'' who performed no official work.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Removal of Rostenkowski from the Ways and Means chairmanship, which
he has held since 1981, would harm efforts to approve Clinton's health
care reform plan. The massive proposal is running into difficulty in
other House committees, and Rostenkowski's legendary power was
expected to boost its prospects in the Ways and Means panel.
</P>
<P>
The Illinois Democrat could, however, still exert a measure of
influence on the legislation by remaining on the committee. Such an
arrangement might seem odd, but there is precedent: Wilbur Mills
yielded the chairmanship of the Ways and Means Committee in the
mid-1970s after publicity about his antics with a stripper, but he
stayed on the panel as a member.
</P>
<P>
In contesting an indictment in court, Rostenkowski would be playing
a high-stakes game that automatically could result in a lengthy prison
term if he were convicted, regardless of the sympathies of a
sentencing judge.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
For example, in a fraud conviction involving a loss of more than
$200,000, federal sentencing guidelines call for a term of 15 months
to 21 months for a defendant with no prior criminal history, as would
be the case with Rostenkowski.
</P>
<P>
If the loss is judged to be smaller -- for example, between $70,000
and $120,000 -- the sentence would range from 10 months to 16 months.
However, in a fraud conviction involving abuse of a position of public
or private trust, as would apply to a member of Congress, the
guidelines call for automatically increasing the period of
incarceration by five months.

 Former S. Africa Policeman Says State Sanctioned Murders (Pretoria) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
PRETORIA, South Africa
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dirk Coetzee is a killer. As he all too
readily admits, the retired security police captain spent two decades
in the utterly ruthless defense of apartheid, leaving a trail of dead
or broken bodies, booby-trapped homes and cars of anti-apartheid
activists, and poisoned dogs.
</P>
<P>
``We grew up brainwashed as the defenders of the last Christian
outpost in Africa,'' Coetzee said. ``When we knelt down at night to
pray to our God, we already knew what his answer would be: Put the
enemy in our hands.''
</P>
<P>
At the height of his career in the security branch of the South
Africa police, said Coetzee, now 49, he planned and helped carry out
dozens of murders of opponents of the white government. He was
regarded as among the best the apartheid system produced to safeguard
South Africa for white Afrikaners like him.
</P>
<P>
But eight years ago he fell out with his superiors and, as a
diabetic, was retired for health reasons. Three years later, in 1989,
the nightmare of every covert operator occurred: Coetzee's black
right-hand man, on death row for killing a white man, spilled the
beans about police murder. Faced with exposure and, Coetzee said, his
possible ``termination'' by security police, he fled the country and
began giving one of the first credible detailed accounts of official
assassinations. He went to Nelson Mandela's African National Congress
for protection, using his information as leverage.
</P>
<P>
``It takes a thief to catch a thief,'' said Coetzee, who has since
returned to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Initially, few believed Coetzee's stories, writing him off as a
turncoat (which he was) out to save his own skin (which he denies).
But most of the stories have been independently corroborated,
including an official investigation by a state commission that
specifically named the highest-ranking police generals as instigators
of ``a horrible network of criminal activity.''
</P>
<P>
Several of the generals have been forced out, with their main
protector, Commissioner Johan van der Merwe, as the last holdout.
Government sources say van der Merwe will be retired in the next few
months, once the new parliament passes a police reform bill.
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Coetzee detailed the internal workings of the
security police, which constitutes about 6 percent of the total force
but has produced the last three commissioners and most of the other
top police generals. He said the security branch always operated above
the law and in defiance of civilian authority. When Frederik W. de
Klerk, still president in March, ordered the retirement of the police
generals mentioned in connection with ``hit squad'' activities, the
commissioner defied him without consequence.
</P>
<P>
Coetzee says he is ready to accept punishment for his crimes and
has refused to ask for amnesty. But before that, he says, he would
like to help clean out the police. ``After all we did, when you come
to your senses, there is no way you can keep quiet,'' he said. ``I am
asking for no indemnity whatever. I am guilty.''

 Rosty Weighs Options on Plea Offer (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The probe started with the House Post Office but, now,
two years after federal prosecutors began investigating Ways and Means
Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., the allegations of
official misconduct have moved far beyond stamps.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the initial allegations that Rostenkowski traded postage
vouchers for cash at the House Post Office now rate as a comparatively
weak portion of the government's case, so much so that his defense
lawyers have plotted to use them to undermine the rest of the case,
sources close to Rostenkowski say. Lawyers see the former House
postmaster who told prosecutors Rostenkowski participated in the
allegedly illegal exchanges as a less than ideal witness.
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski faces a Tuesday deadline for accepting a plea bargain
and almost certain jail time or fighting to salvage what is left of
his public reputation by challenging a litany of charges in court.
Either choice would knock the powerful 66-year-old Chicagoan from his
influential chairmanship and prominent role in shaping President
Clinton's health care legislation and major trade, welfare and
campaign finance bills.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Attorney Eric H. Holder Jr. has outlined for the Justice
Department what has been described as a ``kitchen sink'' of alleged
abuses of Rostenkowski's official accounts for postage, leased
automobiles, office space, supplies and personnel.
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski, completing his 36th year in Congress, entered plea
negotiations in an effort to reduce or eliminate any prison sentence
while avoiding a lengthy legal battle and possibly retaining his Ways
and Means chairmanship, sources familiar with the discussions said.
</P>
<P>
Such negotiations are considered normal and cannot be used against
Rostenkowski should the case go to trial. However, the talks are
acknowledgment on both sides that there might be weaknesses in their
positions.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors, although generally confident of their case if a
federal grand jury approves an indictment, are said to harbor some
concerns Rostenkowski might prove likable to jurors and also benefit
from their assumptions that most officeholders commit similar acts.
</P>
<P>
Still, Rostenkowski's defense attorneys are said to be worried
about the long list of charges in the government's case. Yesterday,
sources described both sides as at loggerheads.
</P>
<P>
Under normal procedures, Rostenkowski would have to relinquish his
chairmanship if indicted on any felony punishable by at least two
years in prison. If he pleads guilty and is given jail time, efforts
to remove him from the chairmanship would likely come immediately.
</P>
<P>
Faced with the ugly options, Rostenkowski is leaning toward
fighting, knowing he will have to cast doubt on each of the
allegations in the laundry list. He also must overcome the public
distaste with politicians and their perks.
</P>
<P>
According to sources knowledgeable about the case, the allegations
of ``ghost employees,'' unrelated to the House Post office, appear the
most difficult to counter.
</P>
<P>
Because of past controversies over members' employees, the House
has well-developed rules governing staff aides. They must show up for
work in a member's Washington or district office, and each pay period
the member must sign a form certifying his employees performed
official duties.
</P>
<P>
In Rostenkowski's case, the FBI interviewed at least a half-dozen
individuals listed as employees of his Chicago district office in
recent years but who were said not to have been seen in the office.
</P>
<P>
One probe centered on a woman who allegedly stayed on the payroll
for years after she supposedly quit to rear her children. The Chicago
Sun-Times in December identified the woman as the wife of a Chicago
alderman and protege of Rostenkowski. The paper also named an elderly
woman in her 70s, who it alleged appeared on Rostenkowski's payroll
four times in the late 1980s. She denied doing any work for him except
babysitting his children. His youngest is in her 30s.
</P>
<P>
Despite the legislative demands of his Ways and Means chairmanship,
Rostenkowski paid close attention to his payroll account, according to
a former employee of the House Finance Office, H. Bruce Avner. He was
assigned to handle the account, in which Rostenkowski made frequent
changes in pay levels and employees to maximize his salary allotment.
</P>
<P>
Holder was faced with the allegations about ``ghost employees''
after he was sworn in as U.S. attorney last October and decided to
present evidence to a new grand jury rather than seek indictments from
one whose term was expiring. The inquiry was also expanded to cover
Rostenkowski's purchases of personal and gift items through his
expense account at the House Stationery Store.
</P>
<P>
Acting on advice of his lawyers, Rostenkowski last January repaid
the government $82,000 charged to his official stationery account over
six years, including what he acknowledged were ``purchases by myself
or others of items for personal use'' as well as ``gifts to those who
had counseled, assisted or supported my activities in public service''
and ``items . . . donated to charities in my district to use as items
at fund-raising auctions.''
</P>
<P>
In letters to House Administration Chairman Charlie Rose, D-N.C.,
Rostenkowski said the reimbursements covered ``various bowls, mugs,
plates, china, clocks, paperweights and decorative items . . . bearing
the congressional seal,'' chairs embossed with a picture of the
Capitol given to supporters, ``tote bags, cuff links . . . key chains,
books'' and ``clocks, magnifying glasses, picture frames, cameras,
albums and some luggage.''
</P>
<P>
House leaders ordered gift items removed from the stationery store
in 1992, but before that time members were allowed to charge them to
their accounts and later pay for the purchases, plus a 10 percent
surcharge. The store in the basement of the Longworth House Office
Building, which does not serve the public, stocks paper goods and
other supplies used in members' offices.
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski said he repaid ``all sums arguably due'' and blamed
``the ambiguity and flexibility surrounding many of the House rules,
which have changed over time.'' His lawyer, Robert S. Bennett, has
argued the stationery store purchases should be ``a matter internal to
the House.''
</P>
<P>
Under the law, Rostenkowski's reimbursements have no bearing on his
potential culpability, but the repayments could influence jurors.
</P>
<P>
His official leases of three automobiles from a Chicago-area
dealership and subsequent acquisition of them as a private owner have
also come under prosecutors' scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
Under House rules, the government pays for lawmakers to lease cars
used for official travel in their districts. They may also acquire
those vehicles after the lease expires. But they are prohibited from
getting special deals to buy cars at discount prices as condition of
the official leases, which are reviewed and preapproved by staff of
the House Administration Committee. Part of the question about
Rostenkowski is whether the cars were used for private purposes rather
than official use while they were leased with government funds.
</P>
<P>
The committee's investigation in early 1992 of House Post Office
irregularities has played a role in shifting the focus from
allegations that Rostenkowski and other lawmakers traded postage
vouchers and stamps for thousands of dollars at the House Post Office.
Robert V. Rota, the former longtime postmaster at the contract
station, initially denied to committee investigators that such
exchanges occurred.
</P>
<P>
Last July, Rota pleaded guilty to embezzlement charges for
participating in such exchanges with two lawmakers court documents
described as ``Congressman A'' and ``Congressman B.'' House records of
Rostenkowski's postage purchases matched him with ``Congressman A,''
whom the documents said received $21,300 from Rota in allegedly
illegal exchanges between 1985 and 1991.
</P>
<P>
The contradiction between Rota's initial denial and subsequent
court admission gives defense lawyers a chance to challenge his
truthfulness before jurors, lawyers close to the case say. He is also
known to be a diffident individual who appears nervous in the public
spotlight, as was evident when he made his pleading before Judge Norma
H. Johnson. Both factors could make him an unsatisfactory witness.
</P>
<P>
Johnson has a reputation for tough sentencing although federal
guidelines leave judges relatively little discretion. Her reputation
is thought to be one reason Rostenkowski considered a plea agreement.
Another worry, one Ways and Means friend said, was being a white
politician facing what would almost certainly be a predominantly black
jury in the District.

 Clinton Foes Intensify Sleaze Campaign (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With an unbridled fury, conservative foes of President
Clinton are spinning sometimes bizarre conspiracy theories about him
into a character-ripping tornado of videotapes, newsletters, radio
chatter and tips to investigative reporters.
</P>
<P>
``It's intense,'' says Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia
professor of political science. ``There is no president in modern
times, since Nixon, who has stirred such basic passions.''
</P>
<P>
Beyond partisan politics, Sabato and other observers attribute the
depth of antipathy toward Clinton to mistrust of the president and his
baby-boom generation, compounded by fear of the change he advocates
and his political skills in promoting it.
</P>
<P>
Illustrating the open contempt being displayed for Clinton:
</P>
<P>
-- The Rev. Jerry Falwell is selling TV viewers of his ``Old Time
Gospel Hour'' a $40 videotape purporting to blame Clinton for several
mysterious deaths in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
-- Conservative activist and radio personality Floyd Brown, already a
thorn in Clinton's side in the Whitewater land-development
investigation, soon may turn his attention to trying to substantiate a
hot new rumor involving supposed Clinton connections with a
drug-smuggling ring.
</P>
<P>
-- Radio and TV talk show commentator Rush Limbaugh instantly
broadcast and embellished a newsletter report that White House deputy
counsel Vince Foster didn't kill himself in a Virginia park last
summer but died in a secret hideaway used by Hillary Clinton and other
Arkansans in Washington; and his body was carried to the spot where it
was found.
</P>
<P>
-- Reflecting the glee with which some conservatives welcomed the
sexual-harassment lawsuit against Clinton by former Arkansas state
employee Paula Jones, Washington Times Editor Wesley Pruden joked in a
May 20 column that Jones says she is able to identify a ``distinctive
mark near the president's clinton.''
</P>
<P>
Sabato says that U.S. politics has ``degenerated into low-level
warfare.'' Attacks on Clinton are motivated not only by ideology but
by ``a personal kind of contempt'' stemming from religiously based
moral outrage and a widespread feeling that, because Clinton received
only a 43 percent plurality victory in a three-man presidential race,
he has no real right to be president, Sabato says.
</P>
<P>
Some leading Clinton-bashers warn that careless heapings of vitriol
could provoke a backlash of sympathy for the president. Many
commentators attributed Clinton's 1992 win partly to counterproductive
GOP personal attacks on him and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, that
began at the Republican National Convention in Houston.
</P>
<P>
Cliff Jackson, the Arkansas attorney and former Oxford University
classmate who made Clinton's Vietnam War draft record a 1992 campaign
issue, complains that the Falwell tape is unsubstantiated and
``engages in the same deceit I object to in Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
Jackson, also a key figure in publicizing womanizing allegations
against Clinton by Arkansas state troopers and Jones, says: ``There
are people out there who think they're helping, but they're hurting.
The truth itself is sufficient here.''
</P>
<P>
Equally dubious about the Falwell tape is Reed Irvine, of the
conservative group Accuracy in Media, a Washington-based watchdog
group that bought newspaper ads to prod The Washington Post into
publishing Jones' allegations. Irvine says the tape ``sounds pretty
wild.''
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
On the tape, Gary Parks, son of a slain onetime Little Rock
security chief for Clinton's presidential campaign, says, ``I feel
that Bill Clinton had my father killed'' to seize secret files on
Clinton love affairs. No proof is offered.
</P>
<P>
The tape is narrated by Larry Nichols, a fired former Arkansas
state official who has admitted he had no evidence for a 1990 lawsuit
he filed alleging Clinton misused state funds to romance five women;
the suit was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Asked about the allegations, Falwell spokesman Mark DeMoss says,
``Yeah, I imagine some of them won't add up, possibly, but all of them
can't be coming out of thin air.''
</P>
<P>
As exemplified by Pruden's off-color gibe, Jones' lawsuit has many
anti-Clintonites so agog that conservative syndicated columnist Cal
Thomas recently decried an atmosphere of ``self-stimulation over
details of Clinton's alleged behavior in a Little Rock hotel room.''
</P>
<P>
Thomas warned that conservatives are ``enjoying themselves too
much'' and should battle Clinton's policies instead of ``too avidly
prolonging their association with this kind of indecent political
exposure.''
</P>
<P>
To the extent that mainstream Republicans join in ``wallowing and
reveling in the mud'' of the Jones suit, Thomas says, ``it just
reinforces the idea that Republicans are out of ideas.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional Add End)
</P>
<P>
But few high-ranking Republicans have concentrated on the rumors
and innuendoes regarding Clinton's personal conduct. Republican
National Chairman Haley Barbour says the party is keeping its distance
from Jones. House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., told Cox
Newspapers recently that a ``sick culture'' is ``destroying the
institution of the presidency as an important symbol binding us
together.''
</P>
<P>
On ABC's ``Nightline'' last month, Limbaugh indicated that
portraying Clinton as a habitual liar is a means of crippling the
president's legislative proposals. ``This is not about getting rid of
the president,'' Limbaugh said. ``This is about people who would like
to stop health care in a legitimate democratic sense, trying to
compete for the minds and hearts of the American people on the basis
that maybe what the president's saying isn't true.''

 Italian Tycoon Struggling With Politics of Premiership (Rome) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Silvio Berlusconi dimmed the lights and drew the blinds in
his elegant office at the Palazzo Chigi. Even at sunset, his day
seemed far from over. There were cables to read, legislative plans to
approve and other tasks of governing that he says keep him working
until as late as 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
Three weeks after becoming Italy's prime minister -- and only three
months after he entered politics -- one of Europe's biggest media
tycoons is struggling to adapt to his new role of running the world's
fifth-largest industrial democracy.
</P>
<P>
``Churchill said politics is fine, except you have to shake too
many hands and deal with too many stupidities,'' Berlusconi said as he
eased into an armchair for his first interview since taking office.
``I'm used to shaking hands, because of my involvement with soccer and
show business, but not to listening to the enormous number of
stupidities that I hear in politics.''
</P>
<P>
``I have 11 houses spread all over, including an extraordinary
park,'' he said. ``Now I am forced to lead a life that, frankly, does
not please me. However, I consider myself to be fighting a war on
behalf of my country.''
</P>
<P>
When President Clinton opens his European tour next Thursday by
paying a call on Italy's reluctant crusader, he will find that
Berlusconi's astounding political rise is still generating shock waves
across the continent.
</P>
<P>
The 57-year-old businessman was swept into power on a tide of voter
disgust with the corruption-ridden caste that ruled Italy for four
decades, stirring fears of further populist revolts against mainstream
governments elsewhere in Europe.
</P>
<P>
He has appointed five cabinet ministers from a party with
neo-fascist roots, arousing fears in France and Germany that their
entry into government will legitimize the growth of extreme right
movements across the continent.
</P>
<P>
He has mapped out a vision for a free-market revolution in one of
Western Europe's most socialistic states that surpasses in scope
anything attempted by his conservative role models, former British
prime minister Margaret Thatcher and former president Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
And he has declared that, at least for the time being, he will
govern the country while maintaining a vast business empire with
holdings in real estate, insurance, press and television -- raising the
specter of conflicting personal interests with almost every
legislative measure he tries to push through Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Berlusconi's opponents accused him of using his three television
networks, which control about 45 percent of the national audience, to
``brainwash'' voters and secure his victory in the general elections.
</P>
<P>
He, in turn, believes they are jealous of his success in finding a
successful formula that rallied the vast majority of young Italian
voters behind the free-enterprise banner waved by his Forza Italia
party.
</P>
<P>
``I know the young generation well. They grew up seeing America
through the television shows that I brought to Europe. They have come
to believe in the meritocratic philosophy that will help us develop a
more liberal and free-market society without losing our cultural roots
or traditions.
</P>
<P>
``Young people everywhere now share the same political values. The
French may be very jealous about their identity, but Italians have no
complexes, no feelings of inferiority or superiority. We are more
ecumenical.'' Nonetheless, the unprecedented sight of seeing a media
tycoon achieve a sudden leap to the pinnacle of political power has
alarmed some of Italy's neighbors.
</P>
<P>
``This is an approach to democracy we are not used to and that
appears fearsome to me,'' said French President Francois Mitterrand,
pointing to the demagogic risks of seeing the boss of a $6 billion
media conglomerate take the reins of a major European government.
``This is an example that others will try to imitate. There is a
serious risk of perverting democracy. The moment has come to say:
Stop! Danger!''
</P>
<P>
Berlusconi brushes off Mitterrand's warning as the kind of partisan
carping he must endure from Italy's former communists and their
leftist allies throughout Europe. ``I have no operational role anymore
in any of my companies. I am completely removed from their
activities,'' he said. ``There is one difficulty and that is how to
sell my group. If you know somebody who is interested, please tell
me.''
</P>
<P>
Berlusconi said he was forced to enter the political arena when
centrist reformers such as Mario Segni, a maverick Christian Democrat,
failed to organize an effective coalition that could block the path to
power by the leftist alliance led by former communists.
</P>
<P>
``I had a very interesting and entertaining life, and I had no
desire to change it. But I found my country facing a future without
liberty or democracy. I was obliged to go into politics against the
advice of my family, my friends and, above all, against my own
interests. But I realized my life as an entrepreneur would have become
impossible under the communists, whose program would have led my
country into a terrible state without any hope of return.''
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Berlusconi's empire, now close to $3 billion in debt,
probably would have collapsed if the leftist slate had been elected.
Achille Occhetto, the leader of the former communists, had vowed to
strip Berlusconi of his lucrative television stations.
</P>
<P>
But Berlusconi insists he was motivated by more than the fate of
his own business interests. ``I went into politics to keep my country
from falling into the hands of the communists,'' he said. ``That's
what I mean by waging war for my country. Their program would have led
the country into a terrible state, with no hope of return. In their
spirit, their mentality, their culture, it's a vision of the world
that has not changed.''

 Rebel Win Now Called Path to Ending Rwandan Slaughter (Nairobi) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NAIROBI, Kenya
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the world community horrified by the
bloodshed in Rwanda but paralyzed by confusion, indecision or fear,
many aid officials, human rights advocates and Africa watchers now are
hoping for a victory by rebel forces to end the tumult.
</P>
<P>
Such a scenario now seems likely, with the Rwandan Patriotic Front
(RPF) rebels improving their positions in neighborhoods around the
capital, Kigali, while advancing on the town of Gitarama, headquarters
of the Rwanda's rump government. Reports said the rebels were moving
this weekend on Gitarama from two fronts, while government soldiers
and allied militiamen were fleeing westward toward Kibuya, on Lake
Kivu.
</P>
<P>
With the rebels occupying large parts of Kigali, including the
international airport, the fall of Gitarama would make a complete
victory for the rebels all but certain, leaving them in control of
most of the country except the west and southwest. That would allow
the rebels to dictate the terms of a cease-fire and would leave them
in a position to try to form a government.
</P>
<P>
Many who have been watching Rwanda's horror say a rebel victory
would relieve foreign governments of witnessing mass slaughter while
failing to muster the political will to try to stop it.
</P>
<P>
``There is some thinking that if the rebels win, maybe that would
take care of the problem for now,'' said Pauline Baker, a scholar on
Africa with the Washington office of the Aspen Institute.
</P>
<P>
Baker said some African policy makers were harking back to the
``Ethiopian scenario'' of May 1991, when the Bush administration
virtually invited an advancing guerrilla army to enter the Ethiopian
capital, Addis Ababa, as a way of ending that country's long civil war
while providing for an orderly transition after the fall of dictator
Mengistu Haile Mariam.
</P>
<P>
Another Rwanda scholar, interviewed in Brussels, said a rebel
victory ``is what everybody is hoping for.'' But this scholar, who
asked not to be quoted by name, said that policy may in the long term
prove ``very unwise,'' since it was unclear how the rebels,
representing Rwanda's long-oppressed Tutsi minority, would be able to
form a broadly representative government.
</P>
<P>
``The RPF looks like the angel in this thing,'' she said. ``But to
let the RPF win creates another Burundi, where you have a tiny
minority in charge.''
</P>
<P>
The populations of both Rwanda and Burundi are about 85 percent
Hutu and 15 percent Tutsi. In Rwanda, the Hutus have held political
power since they overthrew the Tutsi monarchy and achieved
independence from Belgium three decades ago. In Burundi, the minority
Tutsis dominated the country after independence through their control
of the armed forces, and only last year surrendered power in
democratic elections to a Hutu-led government.
</P>
<P>
Seven weeks ago, both countries were thrown into chaos when their
two presidents died in a suspicious plane crash while returning from a
regional peace meeting. Rwanda erupted in killings of Tutsis-mostly by
armed Hutu civilian militias, supported by the army and encouraged by
a Hutu-controlled radio station.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesmen have estimated that at least 200,000 people have
been killed, mostly Tutsis but also Hutus opposed to the slain
president or suspected of being disloyal to his dominant political
machine.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of the dead have been stacked up in churches and along
the roadside, buried in mass graves or simply dropped into the Kagera
River. Thousands of corpses have floated to Lake Victoria, raising
fears of widespread pollution at the source of the Nile River.
</P>
<P>
After the outbreak of the massacres, which most aid officials and
U.N. diplomats have termed genocide, the rebels launched their drive
on the capital to end the bloodshed and bring to justice those
responsible for the killings.
</P>
<P>
When the Security Council earlier this month agreed to the dispatch
of 5,500 U.N. troops to Rwanda, the rebels initially balked, saying
the foreigners might interfere with victory by the front. They have
since said the troops could come if they limited their activities to
protecting humanitarian relief.
</P>
<P>
But the arrival of the foreign troops looks further off than ever,
with U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali admitting that he
had failed to persuade more than a handful of countries to contribute
soldiers. Only Ghana, Ethiopia and Senegal have made firm offers, and
Italy said it would be willing to join in a U.N. peacekeeping
operation. But most countries, including the United States and
Africa's traditional West European patrons, have shown reluctance to
get involved.
</P>
<P>
Following last year's disastrous experience with international
peacemaking in Somalia, many governments -- including the Clinton
administration -- fear being drawn into what is essentially an African
civil war, in which the foreign troops, like those in Somalia, may
shift from being neutral peacekeepers to combatants.
</P>
<P>
``I think there's a sense of moral outrage, but at the same time, a
kind of paralysis,'' said Alison Des Forges, a consultant with Human
Rights Watch/Africa. ``Everybody is looking to the United States for
leadership, but the United States is not providing leadership.''
Somalia, she said, ``has been a formative experience in the early days
of this administration.''
</P>
<P>
After the humiliation in Somalia, in which U.S. troops engaged in a
futile and bloody manhunt for a Somali factional leader through the
streets of Mogadishu, President Clinton reversed his earlier
enthusiasm for involving American troops in U.N. military operations
and issued a directive laying out strict conditions for future U.S.
participation. Rwanda, according to Baker of Aspen Institute, has
become ``the first test case'' of the Clinton directive.
</P>
<P>
``There's no one exerting any leadership to bring about a
consensus'' on how to intervene effectively in Rwanda, Baker said.
``The major issue is a lack of will to search for ideas collectively.
Any solution is going to have great risks attached to it. And that's
the key: No one wants to take those risks.''

 Former S. African Police Carried Out Assassinations (Port Elizabeth) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
PORT ELIZABETH, South Africa
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has taken nine years, but finally
Nyameke Goniwe received formal acknowledgment Saturday that the state
ordered the brutal murder of her husband.
</P>
<P>
In a wood-paneled courtroom here, a Supreme Court judge ended years
of official denials and cover-up by declaring that South Africa's
security forces, in defense of white rule, assassinated anti-apartheid
activist Matthew Goniwe and three of his colleagues on a deserted
stretch of highway in June 1985.
</P>
<P>
The killers, said the judge, meant to defeat the mass uprising of
the 1980s by eliminating one of its most important leaders, who had
turned the eastern Cape region into a hotbed of resistance.
</P>
<P>
``It has, in my opinion, been established prima facie that the
murderers ... were members of the security forces,'' Judge Neville
Zietsman said at the end of a 14-month inquest.
</P>
<P>
The killings, once officially attributed to unknown persons, were
revisited after a disgruntled officer two years ago leaked what
appeared to have been the assassination order: a state security memo
recommending that Goniwe and the others be ``permanently removed from
society, as a matter of urgency.''
</P>
<P>
Listening to Zietsman's finding, Nyameke Goniwe sat very still, as
she had sat through every session of the inquest. Then she walked
quickly out of the courtroom, emotions held tightly in check.
</P>
<P>
``The critical thing is for us to know who did what, and the judge
just confirmed for us what we believed all along,'' she said. ``You
must understand that our lives have revolved around this case for nine
years.''
</P>
<P>
Cases like the Goniwe murder present a delicate problem to the
fledgling democracy led by President Nelson Mandela, who must balance
deeply felt calls for restitution with the theme of national
reconciliation that he has sounded repeatedly since his election three
weeks ago as South Africa's first black leader.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's verdict seems to be only the start of a long, traumatic
process of exhuming the buried skeletons of this country's apartheid
past, as official files are opened and secret documents thought to
have been shredded surface. Estimates of officially mandated killings
of opponents of the state -- as well as the wanton massacres of
civilians by operatives in the state security system -- run into the
thousands.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, worried about possible sabotage of his fragile new
black-led government by the white-dominated security forces, pledged
Friday a blanket amnesty for political crimes committed in the defense
of apartheid. ``There will be ... no vengeance, no witch-hunts, no
revenge and no humiliation,'' said his new justice minister, Dullah
Omar. Amnesty seekers must, however, disclose their crimes in full, he
said, and government will provide unspecified compensation to victims.
</P>
<P>
The sensational murder of Matthew Goniwe underlined the desperate
``total onslaught'' strategy employed in the 1980s by the P.W. Botha
government, which sought to save rapidly disintegrating apartheid
structures by creating an elaborate state security system with
virtually unlimited powers.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
The charismatic Goniwe, a bespectacled 37-year-old schoolteacher,
was targeted because he pioneered a community organizing system based
on a network of street committees. As chief rural organizer for the
United Democratic Front -- the internal, legal arm of the banned
African National Congress -- he created an organizational web so dense
that an entire township could be mobilized in minutes for a rally, a
strike or a rent boycott. Goniwe's telephone was tapped and security
agents followed his every move, court papers show.
</P>
<P>
``He was ... referred to as an enemy of the state whose activities
had to be curtailed or terminated,'' Zietsman said Saturday. By 1985
the entire country was in turmoil. On June 7 of that year, according
to the leaked military document, Gen. Stoffel van der Westhuizen, who
would remain as director of military intelligence until several weeks
ago, sent the message suggesting the ``permanent'' removal of Goniwe,
his brother, Mbulelo, and his friend Fort Calata.
</P>
<P>
But Goniwe's brother was not with him 20 days later, when he headed
home to Cradock from this coastal city after another UDF meeting.
Riding in the car with him were Calata and two others, Sparrow Mkonto
and Sicelo Mhlauli.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
According to the inquest, security forces -- no specific individuals
have yet been identified -- stopped Goniwe and his colleagues. They
shot and stabbed Sparrow Mkonto, and stabbed the othersthrough the
heart and about their bodies.
</P>
<P>
Security police, anxious to conceal the crime, burned the bodies
and the car. The charred remains were found scattered over a wide area
in the following days.
</P>
<P>
``For years I didn't want to pass that spot where it happened,''
Nyameke Goniwe said. ``You could still see the marks on the ground
today; grass has not even grown there.''
</P>
<P>
Charges of government involvement in the killings were quickly
dismissed; an inquest by a local magistrate returned a verdict of
murder by persons unknown. But as the reopened inquest drew to a
close, van der Westhuizen, at less than 50 years of age, suddenly
announced several weeks ago that he was retiring as chief of military
intelligence. He cited ill health.
</P>
<P>
Others implicated have mostly retired with large pensions from the
government of President Frederik W. de Klerk, who now serves as one of
Mandela's two deputies.
</P>
<P>
The state prosecutor, Michael Hodgen said that all the victims'
families could do now was file civil lawsuits against the government
for damages, although the proposed amnesty may make that impossible.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Nyameke Goniwe said presidential calls for forgiveness and
reconciliation were all well and good, ``but the killers have not even
admitted they did anything wrong.''
</P>
<P>
``The families have lost everything, and the perpetrators are
gaining from it,'' she said. ``We want to celebrate with everybody the
new beginning of a new country, but this has been holding us back.''

 Perry Gets Top Marks on National Security Team (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Clinton's foreign policy difficulties may be
igniting widespread criticism of his national security team, but at
least one top official is escaping most of the heat: Defense Secretary
William J. Perry.
</P>
<P>
In the past four months, the soft-spoken former mathematics
professor has emerged as one of the administration's few pleasant
surprises in the foreign policy arena. Besides getting a grip on the
Pentagon's sprawling bureaucracy -- and gaining the respect of the
military -- Perry, 66, has become a quiet but important player in the
administration's foreign policy apparatus, gradually winning plaudits
from the administration and its critics alike.
</P>
<P>
It was Perry, for example, who helped hone the administration's
proposal to launch air strikes in Bosnia -- limiting the enforcement to
a small exclusion zone that NATO forces could handle easily. He was
the administration's point man in engineering a nuclear weapons
disarmament treaty between Russia and Ukraine. And, more recently, he
has become its chief spokesman in the stalemate with North Korea over
nuclear weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
With few glitches along the way, Perry ``is dealing with the
problems he's got as well as anyone can be expected to,'' said Robert
W. Gaskin, a former Pentagon military strategist who has been a
frequent critic of the administration.
</P>
<P>
Sharing that opinion is Harold Brown, who served as defense
secretary during the Carter administration. ``Is he going to solve all
of their problems? I think the answer is no,'' Brown said. ``But he
has done very well.''
</P>
<P>
Admittedly, at least part of Perry's overnight rise may have come
by default. By some outside assessments, Secretary of State Warren
Christopher has proved a capable negotiator but not a strategic
thinker, and national security adviser Anthony Lake has been so
low-key that he has failed to enunciate the administration's policies
clearly. Perry is known as a problem-solver, and he explains issues
articulately and directly.
</P>
<P>
He also has benefited from the inevitable comparisons to his
predecessor, Les Aspin.
</P>
<P>
Aspin's plans to inject the Pentagon into formulating broad foreign
policy brought him into conflict with the State Department and the
National Security Council. His frequent public ruminating about policy
options and his accompanying gaffes heightened the perception that the
administration was in disarray. And his manipulative style alienated
many in Congress and the military.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Perry is demonstrating himself to be a no-nonsense
pragmatist who is quick to make decisions and has an impressive
command of detail. Invariably straightforward, he has restored good
relations with military leaders and lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
``He has the complete confidence of the military -- he's frank,''
said Rep. John P. Murtha, D-Pa., chairman of the House Appropriations
subcommittee on defense. ``I think he's doing a commendable job.''
</P>
<P>
Others say he has quietly brought order out of the previous
managerial chaos. ``Perry is nothing that Aspin was, and everything
that Aspin wasn't,'' one Pentagon-watcher said.
</P>
<P>
He also has confined himself to the defense secretary's traditional
role of running the nation's military establishment and finding ways
to make it serve the president's foreign policy objectives.
</P>
<P>
Sometimes that means squelching a proposal that seems
unrealistically ambitious. For instance, administration officials say
he recently nipped a campaign to mount an invasion of Haiti by
publicly questioning what the United States would do once its troops
took over the island.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Perry's four months as secretary have not been entirely
error-free. In an appearance on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' program in
early April, he set off a major brouhaha by inadvertently leaving the
impression that the United States would sit by and let the Bosnian
Serbs storm the Muslim city of Gorazde.
</P>
<P>
And a few weeks ago, he provoked a similar flurry over Haiti when
he suggested there were preliminary indications that the island's
military strongman, Gen. Raoul Cedras, was about to resign. The
political and diplomatic ripples from that incident caused some
consternation in the State Department, but so far Perry seems to have
recovered successfully, vowing to become more careful in his
statements to the news media.

</P>
<P>
A veteran of the Cuban missile crisis -- he was called in by the
Pentagon in 1962 to help analyze data on Soviet weapons emplacements
on the island -- Perry has a keen sense of the moment, especially about
developments that help mark the end of the Cold War. A visit to a
former Soviet ICBM center last spring left him emotion-filled and
eager to tell the world about his experience, as did a NATO meeting
last week with former Soviet bloc states.
</P>
<P>
With a long career in the defense industry -- he is known as the
godfather of the Stealth bomber -- and a background in U.S.-Soviet
strategy, high-technology weapons and defense-industry problems, Perry
said he has already set a firm agenda for his current term as defense
secretary: to keep the world from drifting back into a Cold War, to
develop a new approach for using U.S. military power in the post-Cold
War world and to manage the reduction in the size of the nation's
armed forces.
</P>
<P>
``I will measure myself'' by these ``when I leave the job,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
(Optional Add End)
</P>
<P>
Critics concede he has made a good start on the first of these,
painstakingly forging and cementing ties with former Soviet Bloc
military leaders, helping achieve an accord with Russia and Ukraine to
dismantle their nuclear weapons, and pressing the administration's new
Partnership for Peace program in NATO.
</P>
<P>
He has begun work on his second objective by creating half a dozen
new task forces within the Pentagon to study proposals for altering
the way the United States uses military power.
</P>
<P>
On the third, he has begun efforts to streamline the way the
Pentagon buys equipment and weapons systems. He has also sought to
ease the impact of military downsizing on the nation's defense
industries base by eliminating excess regulations and preserving some
programs in order to keep production lines open.

 The Tab for the Golf Outing: More than $13K (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The final tally is in for the golf outing last Tuesday
by a White House aide who took a presidential helicopter to play a
course near Camp David: $13,129.66
</P>
<P>
The White House Saturday night released that figure and said senior
staffers -- but not President Clinton -- will contribute the full amount
to reimburse the Treasury within the week. Thirteen staffers, nearly
the entire White House senior hierarchy, have agreed to chip in.
</P>
<P>
The bill, calculated by the Marine Corps, is based on a total of 5
hours and 31 minutes of flying for two helicopters. The first carried
David Watkins, who resigned Thursday as White House director of
administration, to Camp David and then to the nearby Holly Hills
Country Club; the second was a training flight paired with the Watkins
helicopter. The White House said it would reimburse taxpayers for both
helicopter flights.
</P>
<P>
Clinton pledged Thursday that the taxpayers would not be out ``one
red cent'' for the cost of the golf outing by Watkins and the head of
the White House military office, Alfonso Maldon Jr., who is being
reassigned. But officials were in a bind when Watkins, a longtime
Arkansas friend of Clinton's whose financial disclosure statement pegs
his worth at more than $1 million, balked at paying for the flight.
</P>
<P>
White House staffers were furious with what they viewed as
Watkins's poor judgment in deciding to take the trip, which he
defended even in his resignation letter as a perfectly appropriate
effort to see that the president enjoyed Camp David to the maximum.
Watkins reasoned that golfing in nearby New Market, Md., could
facilitate that. Presidential aides were even more incensed when
Watkins refused to reimburse taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the White House chose to bill the staff willingness to
chip in as what Communications Director Mark Gearan called a ``gesture
of friendship'' to Watkins and Maldon. Maldon was not asked to repay
the money on the grounds that he was following Watkins's orders.
</P>
<P>
Saturday, the White House line changed. Asked whether the repayment
effort should continue to be viewed as a gesture of friendship to
Watkins, one senior official answered with an emphatic ``no,'' adding:
``Since Mr. Watkins declined to make full payment, White House staff
members volunteered to pay the cost of both flights, rather than
forcing the issue, to ensure that the president's pledge was
fulfilled.''
</P>
<P>
A Marine Corps statement, released by the White House, said White
House officials had not requested and were not aware of the second
helicopter, which was described as a ``routine training flight related
to potential landing sites with respect to medical or other
contingency concerning movement around Camp David.''
</P>
<P>
The Marine Corps said scheduling training flights in conjunction
with other White House flights was ``routine procedure'' in order to
make certain that crews receive their mandatory flight time and to
have them on hand in case there are mechanical difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the pilot of the first helicopter had only 9.4
hours of his 24 monthly minimum and the pilot of the second helicopter
had 11.3 hours toward his minimum.
</P>
<P>
When Clinton went out for a round Saturday at the Robert Trent
Jones course at Lake Manassas, Va., he traveled by motorcade, his
usual mode of transportation for local golfing.

 Former Farrakhan Aide Greeted With Fervent Applause in Los Angeles 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LOS ANGELES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Khallid Abdul Muhammad, condemned nationally by most
black and white leaders as a racist hate-monger, was greeted with
fervent applause Saturday night by an audience of more than 1,000
African Americans in a theater here.
</P>
<P>
Muhammad, the 43-year-old former senior aide to Louis Farrakhan,
head of the Nation of Islam, displayed once again his strident brand
of black nationalism that is routinely laced with condemnation of
Jews.
</P>
<P>
Contending that blacks have suffered more than Jews at the hands of
oppressors (``the black holocaust is one hundred times worse than any
other holcaust,'' he said at one point), Muhammad quickly launched
into the kind of name-calling and racial mockery that has earned him
national enmity.
</P>
<P>
``Don't let those bagel-eating, hooked-nosed ... wanna-be Jews make
you think otherwise,'' he said of his statistical claim.
</P>
<P>
Wearing long royal-blue robes over a crisp white shirt, Muhammad
theatrically listed some of the most tragic episodes in the history of
black people in America, starting with the horrors of the slave ship
crossings. As his voice rose in indignation, insisting that
recognition of black suffering had been repressed, the crowd applauded
and shouted words of agreement. By the time he came to one of his most
emotional statements -- ``the worst crime that can be committed is to
be robbed of self knowledge'' -- the audience errupted in frenzied
applause and screams of agreement that nearly drowned out Muhammad's
voice.
</P>
<P>
There were also moments of dark humor. Arguing that Jesus was
black, Muhammad said, ``The Bible said Jesus would have hair like
lamb's wool, that nappy hair. ... I'm talking about a black lord, a
black Jesus, a black savior. Take that cracker down off your wall and
throw him in the garbage.'' The audience screamed in delight.
</P>
<P>
The crowd that came to see Muhammad did so out of a mixture of
curiosity and almost-religious support.
</P>
<P>
The believers said Muhammad had touched a strong chord among
American blacks and that his strength was his appeal to black
self-sufficiency, not racism -- and that some of his outrageousness
should be taken figuratively.
</P>
<P>
``He's telling black people to rise and take care of ourselves,''
said UCLA student Susan Leach, 21. ``I believe in everything he says.
I think it's white people who make the controversy.''
</P>
<P>
``He's not anti-Semitic or racist,'' said Patrick Pritchett, 41.
``How could he be? How can the first people on earth be racist or
anti-Semitic?''
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Outside the theater, the neighborhood took on the air of a street
festival, intensified by a rally held in an adjacent park by a group
called the All-African People's Revolutionary Party.
</P>
<P>
Inside the hall, all members of the crowd and the press were
frisked for weapons. Women's handbags were searched, and all objects -- 
including pens and makeup containers -- were scrutinized. When the
speeches began, the crowd was treated to what seemed like a cross
between the impassioned spirit of a rally and the fervor of a church
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Before Muhammad came onstage, the audience was treated to an
African dance troupe, a history lesson from a speaker who decried
numerous incidents of racism and oppression against blacks, and a roll
call of visiting celebrities. Actor Wesley Snipes, sitting in the
front row, came onstage briefly when he was introduced. Rapper Ice T,
who had earlier embraced Muhammad backstage, gave a rousing speech.
</P>
<P>
Also onstage were such guests as Georgiana Williams, the mother of
Damian Williams, the most celebrated defendant convicted in the
Reginald O. Denny beating trial that grew out of the 1992 Los Angeles
riots, and Celes King, a well-known bail bondsman and former president
of the Los Angeles Human Relations Commission and the Los Angeles
chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People.

 When the President Is Sued 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The following editorial appeared in Sunday's Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
The sexual-harassment lawsuit filed by Paula Jones against
President Clinton is a case of first impression -- no one has ever
brought a civil suit against a sitting president for alleged conduct
that occurred before he took office.
</P>
<P>
The court is sure to hear a variety of arguments on why the lawsuit
should be thrown out. Unfortunately for the president, every angle
that has been suggested so far has flaws.
</P>
<P>
The president's advisers have put forward a theory that the chief
executive is simply immune from civil suits, or at the very least
entitled to have litigation postponed until he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
They cite a 1982 Supreme Court ruling that accorded President
Richard Nixon this protection. But that case is easily distinguished,
because it was limited to suits arising out of a president's official
acts, specifically in that case Nixon's firing of whistle-blower
Ernest Fitzgerald. Such an immunity is similar to the kind enjoyed by
legislators and judges who cannot be sued for actions taken in their
official capacity.
</P>
<P>
The allegations against Clinton, of course, arose out of conduct
that occurred long before he became president and certainly involved
no actions that were part of his official duties. The president's
lawyers may well ask a judge to make the leap from protecting official
acts to shielding private ones, but such a finding would be a
substantial extension of the Nixon v . Fitzgerald doctrine.
</P>
<P>
Harvard professor Laurence Tribe has another theory that is even
more imaginative. He cites a federal statute that protects military
personnel on active duty from civil suits and argues that since the
president is commander in chief of the armed forces, he is included in
the protected group.
</P>
<P>
The statute mentions no civilians and was clearly intended to cover
men and women whose ability to defend lawsuits is severely hampered by
the nature of military service.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the immunity defense, the president's attorneys may
also move to dismiss on other grounds, questioning, for example, Paula
Jones's use of an old civil-rights statute to support a legal action
that should have been brought under the equal-employment laws -- but on
these laws the statute of limitations had run out.
</P>
<P>
Others will question the plaintiff's motives, point to her partisan
supporters and complain that she waited until the last minute to file
this suit. But probably none of these objections will carry weight in
court. It is likely that motions to dismiss will fail. But extended
appeals may perhaps postpone an actual trial for years.
</P>
<P>
The prospect of a public airing of these charges -- true or not -- is
surely troubling for the president and for a lot of people who have an
interest in the well-being of his presidency, irrespective of anything
else. But the alternative of granting a single individual special
immunity from civil suit in these circumstances is not a good idea -- 
no matter how powerful he is or how important it is that he be able to
conduct the business of his office.
</P>
<P>
Even those who believe Clinton has been wronged in this case need
to consider the precedent that would be set by such a waiver. Divorce
actions could be delayed, child-custody disputes postponed for years,
damage claims ranging from auto accidents to industrial pollution
could be shelved, leaving victims in each case without remedies for
years.
</P>
<P>
Like every citizen who finds himself in a legal dispute, the
president must defend himself in court. Frivolous cases and claims
arising out of his office can be dismissed. His schedule can be
accommodated, and demands on his time can be minimized. But
individuals with private claims have a right to proceed, and he has
the obligation to respond.

 Solzhenitsyn's Russia 
 The following editorial appeared in Sunday's Baltimore Sun: 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his 18 years as a reclusive writer in Cavendish, Vt., Alexander
Solzhenitsyn created an ideal Russia. It existed in his mind, within
the walls of his household and in the forests of birch trees, which
had the same sun and blue sky that on good days can be seen in Russia.
</P>
<P>
He saw few visitors besides his family, had virtually no contact
with the outside world. Instead, he applied the grueling
self-discipline he adopted during his years in Stalin's gulags .
</P>
<P>
He got up at 6 every morning and spent the rest of the day writing,
completing ``The Red Wheel,'' his four-volume history of events
leading to the 1917 Russian Revolution. No one knows whether that
exhaustive and long-winded history will ever be published in full. Few
people in the West are that interested in the subject.
</P>
<P>
As for Russians, they no longer have endless time to read about
past history that has little relevance to matters at hand. Like
millions of Westerners, they are hustling to make a living.
</P>
<P>
We wish Solzhenitsyn well as he returns to his native Russia. But
we fear he is in for a tremendous disappointment.
</P>
<P>
Crime and corruption are rampant, Western pop music, pulp
literature and pornography prevalent. He will have a tough time trying
to reconcile his idealized view of Russia with the rudeness and greed
he will encounter or with the country's disregard for thoughtful
writing and high culture.
</P>
<P>
As a painstaking chronicler of the gulags , Solzhenitsyn made his
contribution not only to history but to a public realization at home
and abroad of the true nature of communism. The country which
oppressed and exiled him no longer exists, however. It was replaced by
another that is still taking its first steps on a long road to
economic prosperity, cultural fulfillment and rule of law.
</P>
<P>
Anticipating the collapse of communism, Solzhenitsyn wrote in 1991
that ``we must take care not to be crushed beneath its rubble instead
of gaining liberty.'' As he moves to Moscow, he may realize that life
in Vermont offered more inner peace. Russia may be eternal, but it,
too, changes.

 A New Light on India 
 The following editorial appeared in Sunday's Los Angeles Times: 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For most of the last half-century, the relationship between the
United States and India was colored by Cold War distrust. Differences
between the world's two most populous democracies were frequent, with
Washington voicing concern over India's ties to the Soviet Union, its
nonaligned status, its state-dominated economy and its nuclear weapons
program. From a U.S. perspective, there was cause for suspicion, and
that suspicion was the basis for a longstanding U.S. policy in South
Asia that favored Pakistan, India's neighbor and bitter rival.
</P>
<P>
Now, however, the Soviet Union is gone and India is making a
revolutionary transformation from socialist protectionism to a
market-oriented economy. In light of this and the fact that Pakistan
now has nuclear weapons, the United States is being forced to reassess
the Indo-American relationship.
</P>
<P>
Economic cooperation between the two nations is important. The
United States already is India's largest export market, and U.S.
corporations like AT T, Ford, General Electric, Coca-Cola and IBM have
operations in India. An enduring economic relationship appears
certain.
</P>
<P>
In a speech this month before a joint session of the U.S. Congress,
Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao emphasized the new economic
ties between Washington and New Delhi. For that matter, so has
Ambassador-designate Frank Wisner, who will fill a 16-month vacancy
and is expected to be confirmed when the Senate reconvenes after the
Memorial Day holiday recess.
</P>
<P>
Such optimistic assessments are certainly welcome. But as the
United States becomes more economically linked to India, it will be
forced to face up to some uncomfortable differences that persist.
These include India's continuing attempt to develop nuclear weapons
and its efforts, much criticized by human rights groups, to crush a
separatist insurrection in Kashmir. The violence in Kashmir reportedly
has claimed as many as 20,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
Although the United States and India can easily agree on the
benefits of a stronger economic relationship, they aren't likely to
find the going smooth as they confront the political challenges.

 U.S. Defense Industry Supplies the World with Arms (Washington) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Next year, for the first time, the United States will
produce more combat planes for foreign air forces than for the
Pentagon, highlighting America's replacement of the Soviet Union as
the world's main arms supplier.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the Clinton administration, the defense industry last
year had its best export year ever, having sold $32 billion worth of
weapons overseas, more than twice the 1992 total of $15 billion.
</P>
<P>
As the administration and the industry look abroad for new markets
to offset military spending cutbacks at home, they are raising concern
in Congress and a chorus of criticism from arms control advocates.
</P>
<P>
``Things have moved toward the `merchants of death' view of arms
production,'' said Randall Forsberg, executive director of the
Institute for Defense and Disarmament Studies in Cambridge, Mass.
``It's becoming a commercial business involved in profits and jobs
rather than security.''
</P>
<P>
This will be the last year this century that the U.S. defense
industry will produce more combat planes for domestic than overseas
use, according to a study by Forsberg.
</P>
<P>
Next year, 92 combat planes will be delivered to U.S. forces; 97
will go abroad. In 1996, the Pentagon will get just 24, compared with
153 for overseas. Planes are, except for ships, the most expensive
weapons, and account for more than half the value of U.S. arms
exports.
</P>
<P>
The increase in arms exports, Forsberg said, creates a long-term
paradox for the United States: Foreign sales were meant to help keep
the U.S. defense industry operating and able to meet future threats;
but the main source of new threats is likely to come from the
proliferation arms abroad .
</P>
<P>
``They are going to create the very threats they are insuring
against,'' she said. ``Short-term commercial interests are outweighing
our long-term security interests.''
</P>
<P>
Joel Johnson, international vice president of the Aerospace
Industries Association, countered that as the United States reduces
its overseas military presence and demands that allies accept more of
the defense burden, it is inevitable that the allies will need more
weapons.
</P>
<P>
``You can't have it both ways,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
The export of older-model combat planes is overtaking their
production for domestic use, he said, as the Pentagon develops such
new programs as the F-22 fighter, improved F-18 attack jets and the
Commanche helicopter.
</P>
<P>
Once those new planes go into production for the Pentagon around
the turn of the century, the gap between higher exports and lower
domestic sales will be corrected, he said.
</P>
<P>
``The only thing now keeping the (production) lines open is
exports,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that 450,000 U.S. defense workers have lost their jobs since
1991, Johnson said: ``Why do you want to fire people in St. Louis and
hire them in Paris?''
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Mindful of the controversy, the Clinton administration is forging a
new arms sales policy. A senior White House official involved in
drafting the policy said it would seek to establish an ``international
regime'' of nations with ``a common set of standards'' for arms
exports.
</P>
<P>
The intent would be to restrict arms exports to particular regions
or countries and bar the sale of certain weapons systems altogether.
The official declined to be more specific.
</P>
<P>
Testifying to the Senate Budget Committee earlier this year,
Defense Secretary William J. Perry said: ``The dominant criterion for
determining whether any weapons systems ... are sold to a foreign
government still is a national security decision, not an economic
decision.''
</P>
<P>
But critics question that assertion.
</P>
<P>
``The (Clinton) policy and practice, as far as we can see, is a
continuation of what the policy under Bush and Reagan was, which was
sell, sell, sell,'' said Sima Osdoby, director of policy for Women's
Action for New Directions, a Washington group seeking to divert
defense spending to social programs.
</P>
<P>
Natalie J. Goldring, of the the British American Security
Information Council, a Washington-based advocacy and research group,
said: ``The United States has a special responsibility to lead efforts
toward arms-transfer control. Instead, U.S. policy is moving in the
direction of less-restricted arms sales.''
</P>
<P>
In a paper titled ``In Search of Arms Control,'' she pointed to
Clinton's support of major arms-sales contracts during the 1992
election campaign and while in office; his loosening of controls on
high-technology exports; the taxpayer subsidy of U.S. company displays
at foreign air shows; and an Air Force plan to sell up to 360 used
F-16s abroad to enable it to buy up to 88 more sophisticated planes.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Until 1990, the Soviet Union led in military sales to an
arms-hungry world as it sought to export and defend global Communist
revolution. Between 1989 and 1991, as the Soviets retreated from the
market, world arms sales fell by 53 percent. U.S. arms sales declined
less steeply, by 34 percent, leaving the United States with a bigger
share of a smaller pie. In 1991, the United States took the lead in
international arms sales and has widened it since.
</P>
<P>
In 1981, the United States supplied 19.3 percent of world arms
exports, compared with the Soviet Union's 39.9 percent. In 1991,
according to the latest statistics from the U.S. Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency, the U.S. share had nearly doubled, to 37.8
percent; the Soviet share was down to 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Arms Control Association, a Washington research and lobbying
group, says that the export trend has continued. Last year, the United
States supplied about 50 percent of the world arms market; Russia
supplied 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
U.S. arms sales were boosted by the Persian Gulf war, which
provided a showcase for advanced U.S. weapons technology, with
``smart'' bombs disappearing on worldwide TV down the air conditioning
ducts of strategic buildings in Iraq. Governments able to afford such
weapons lined up to place their orders;
</P>
<P>
The United States has even overcome its traditional reluctance to
arm the Third World. It increased its share of the military market in
developing countries from 12.8 percent in 1981 to 32.3 percent in
1991. Over the same period, the Soviet share dropped from 42.7 percent
to 33.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Most of the arms-sales growth is in two regions -- the Middle East
and Eastern Asia. Critics assert that the United States in some areas
of the world is engaged in an arms race with itself by supplying
weapons to both sides of potential conflicts. Turkey and Greece,
historic foes, have been two of this country's biggest customers. But
the most dramatic example has been in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia
placed a $9 billion order for 72 F-15XPs in 1992. This year, Israel
matched that with a $2.4 billion purchase of 25 ultra-sophisticated
F-15Is.
</P>
<P>
Some in Congress express concern that economic considerations are
driving conventional-arms sales overseas, jeopardizing national
security. Legislation to set standards for U.S. arms exports has been
introduced in both the House and Senate.

minority member Bob Packwood, R-Ore., agreed before the break to have
their aides work out language embodying areas of agreement and have it
ready for consideration when Congress returns June 8.
</P>
<P>
No one is betting how far the bipartisan exercise will go, but
there is agreement on both sides of the Capitol that it represents
what may be one of the last hopes for a breakthrough on the
health-care front.
</P>
<P>
Chairman Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., of the Senate Labor and Human
Resources Committee, which shares jurisdiction with Finance, aims to
finish his version of a health bill the first week back. Despite
concessions that have won bipartisan agreement on some secondary
features of the plan, the bill as a whole does not seem likely to draw
significant Republican support.
</P>
<P>
That is clearly the case with the measure being worked on in the
counterpart Education and Labor Committee in the House. A draft that
cleared one of its subcommittees just before the recess is described
by critics as ``Clinton-Plus,'' promising even more benefits and
imposing even more regulatory burdens than the White House plan that
has failed to enlist moderate Democratic or Republican support.
</P>
<P>
The House Energy and Commerce Committee appears so deadlocked in
its efforts to draft a bill that Chairman John D. Dingell, D-Mich.,
has spoken privately of throwing up his hands and asking the House to
discharge the panel from further consideration of the measure.
</P>
<P>
Dingell has been unable to get a sufficient number of Democrats to
accept his watered-down version of the Clinton bill, so he never began
formal markup sessions. A middle group of conservative Democrats and
moderate Republicans on the committee has been equally frustrated
about trying to frame a compromise.
</P>
<P>
The last of the Big Five health committees, House Ways and Means,
has been slowed to a crawl, in part by the delay in getting cost
estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, and in part by the
threatened indictment of its chairman, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.
</P>
<P>
Although its health subcommittee finished marking up a major
proposal more than a month ago, Ways and Means has not gotten beyond
the general discussion stage.
</P>
<P>
Taken together, the problems with the other committees and their
products have led such key legislators as Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn., to
say, ``We're all hoping Senate Finance can find a fresh trail out of
this swamp.''
</P>
<P>
Three developments have raised hopes that this is not just a
wistful dream. Last week three other moderate Republicans on Finance -- 
Sens. John H. Chafee, R.I., Dave Durenberger, Minn., and John C.
Danforth, Mo. -- encouraged Packwood and Moynihan to explore a
compromise.
</P>
<P>
They reportedly told the chairman that the act of drafting is the
quickest way, as one of them put it, to ``turn Bob Dole away from
political posturing and focus him on what really needs to be done.''
</P>
<P>
Sen. Robert J. Dole, R-Kan., the Senate minority leader and a
member of the Finance Committee, is the man Moynihan has tried
repeatedly to enlist as a partner, but pressure from conservative
Republicans has made Dole increasingly critical of anything resembling
the Clinton plan.
</P>
<P>
The second development that raised hopes of a Finance Committee
compromise has been the series of trial balloons floated by Sen. John
B. Breaux, D-La., co-sponsor with Cooper of a managed-competition plan
that once appeared to be the major rival to the Clinton bill.
</P>
<P>
Last week Breaux proposed omitting for now any requirement that all
employers buy health insurance for their workers. That ``employer
mandate'' section of the Clinton bill has been denounced by Dole and
other Republicans and is a major sticking point to compromise.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Breaux would rely on insurance reforms to bring coverage
to more Americans but would require that in three to five years, if
specified percentages of the uninsured have not been able to buy
policies, ``employer mandates'' would be applied.
</P>
<P>
Dole's initial reaction was skeptical. ``Congress is here every
year,'' he said. ``We don't need to bind some future Congress, and we
can't do it anyhow.'' But he also said, ``Everybody is looking for a
way to avoid mandates up front, but to bring them in if we don't get
to what the president likes to call universal coverage.''
</P>
<P>
The third positive factor was the reaction of Senate Majority
Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, also on Finance, to the Breaux
proposal and the Moynihan-Packwood effort.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell is regarded as the committee's most influential protector
of Clinton's positions. But Mitchell said in an interview that ``the
`employer mandate' is only one route to universal coverage, and if
someone else -- Senator Breaux or Senator Packwood or Senator Chafee -- 
suggests a way to get there by other means, we'll look at it.''
</P>
<P>
Committee sources said Mitchell's private reaction to the Breaux
plan is more supportive than those public comments. But they also
cautioned against assuming that it will be easy to bridge the
differences on mandates, cost containment and other intractable issues
before Congress takes another break on July 1.

 Eagles Soar Once Again in Concert of Surprises (Irvine) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
IRVINE, Calif.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Eagles certainly didn't take it easy in
returning to concerts after 14 years.
</P>
<P>
Instead of playing it safe by simply serving up the two dozen or so
of the best-known Eagles tunes in a nostalgia-to-the-max reunion
package, the most celebrated Southern California band since the '60s
gamely threw all sorts of surprises at the audience on Friday at
Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre.
</P>
<P>
Surprise 1: Defying the conventional concert wisdom of saving your
signature tune for a climactic moment late in the show, the Eagles
opened with ``Hotel California.''
</P>
<P>
Surprise 2: Instead of inviting the audience to then settle into a
golden oldies mode by following with such peaceful, easy trademark
hits such as ``Take It Easy,'' the band followed ``Hotel California''
with more challenging fare -- four more songs from the ``Hotel
California'' album, including ``Wasted Time'' and ``Pretty Maids All
in a Row.''
</P>
<P>
Surprise 3: After devoting most of the opening hour to old Eagles
material, the quintet shifted emphasis dramatically in the second half
to focus on new Eagles tunes and the members' solo works.
</P>
<P>
Surprise 4: The group didn't perform ``The Long Run,'' ``Best of My
Love,'' ``Last Resort,'' ``Sad Cafe,'' ``On the Border,'' ``Take It
Easy`` or ``Peaceful Easy Feeling'' at all. The result: Only 13 of the
29 songs were from the Eagles '70s catalog.
</P>
<P>
Biggest Surprise: The show still worked.
</P>
<P>
``Good party,'' a beaming Glenn Frey said at one point, looking out
at the 15,000 cheering fans as he stood on a stage whose set resembled
a Mad Max-like industrial wasteland -- in keeping with the apocalyptic
nature of some Eagles songs. ``Real good party.''
</P>
<P>
The audience was equally enthused.
</P>
<P>
Fans, some of whom had come from as far away as New York and
Kentucky to toast the start of the group's first tour since their
bitter 1980 break-up, shouted, ``Thank you'' and ``We love you''
throughout the show. Many sang along with all the hits and danced in
front of their seats to the upbeat tunes.
</P>
<P>
Yet the selection of songs suggested that the Eagles had more on
their minds than merely the applause of the night.
</P>
<P>
Amid all the talk about the tour simply being a one-time,
money-driven affair, the Eagles were intent on demonstrating that,
indeed, the band is in for the long run -- that the reason Frey, Don
Henley, Don Felder, Joe Walsh and Timothy B. Schmit came back together
after all these years was to resume writing and recording together.
</P>
<P>
And that issue -- the recapturing of the band's old creative spark -- 
is the real challenge facing the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
The band wasted little time Friday in passing Test One of the
reunion campaign.
</P>
<P>
Midway through the opening hour, it was clear that the Eagles
remain the masters of such '70s trademarks as sweet, seductive
harmonies and precise but flavorful musicianship. It was also apparent
that the band's best songs -- including ``Hotel California'' and
``Desperado'' -- speak of social and personal morality in ways that
remain relevant.
</P>
<P>
The question is whether the Eagles will be able to come up with new
songs that continue to reflect on human rituals and rites with equal
insight and skill. That is the more important Test Two -- and an answer
isn't likely until the band delivers an album of new material,
possibly next summer.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Meantime, the group is trying to encourage fans to look forward -- 
not just backward. The solo material -- notably Henley's ``Heart of the
Matter,'' ``New York Minute'' and ``Boys of Summer'' -- served as a
bridge and helped add a more contemporary edge to the evening's tone.
Similarly, the turning of the microphone over to Frey, Walsh and
Schmit for solo turns was a reminder that the band isn't just a Henley
or Henley-Frey proposition.
</P>
<P>
Of the four new tunes being introduced on the tour, the most
striking is the fiery ``Get Over It,'' a wickedly satiric reflection
by Henley and Frey on '90s political correctness, with a strong
commercial feel to it.
</P>
<P>
The Eagles, who were joined on various numbers by four support
musicians, haven't tried to add flash to their performances. The
quintet still simply relies on its music -- and that music still serves
them well. The Eagles are once again flying high.

 Pondering Presidential Privilege (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Clinton's planned defense against the sexual
harassment lawsuit by a former Arkansas state employee raises
questions of presidential privilege that have been debated since the
founding of the republic, and that courts and presidents have grappled
with ever since.
</P>
<P>
White House Counsel Lloyd N. Cutler last week sketched out one
possible legal argument for Clinton: that the Constitution generally
protects a sitting president from being sued for damages.
</P>
<P>
The balance in this case -- in which Paula Corbin Jones waited three
years before bringing suit and has no urgent need for recompense -- 
tips in favor of forcing her to delay her lawsuit until the end of
Clinton's term, Cutler said on the MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has not yet decided what he will have his private lawyers
argue in court, but sources close to the president said he may go
beyond simply arguing that the case should be put off until after he
leaves office and contend that, in this case, Jones has lost her
chance to sue by waiting until after Clinton became president.
</P>
<P>
But the sources said Clinton does not plan to contend that a
president or former president is absolutely immune from being sued in
any circumstances over his private conduct.
</P>
<P>
The issue has never been decided by a court, and the debate
reflects the tension in American law between the fundamental precept
that no one is above the law -- a departure from the English rule that
the king could do no wrong -- and the need, rooted in both practical
and constitutional considerations, to protect the office of the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
Courts are more likely to side with the claims of presidential
privilege in civil suits than in criminal cases, where the needs of
prosecutors or criminal defendants may take precedence.
</P>
<P>
In the Watergate tapes case, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously
that then-President Richard M. Nixon could not assert executive
privilege as a grounds for refusing to turn over the tapes to the
special prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
Presidents have also testified as witnesses in criminal
proceedings, but have at the same time been granted more procedural
protections than ordinary witnesses. Presidents Gerald R. Ford and
Jimmy Carter gave videotaped testimony in criminal cases while in
office, and President Ronald Reagan gave a videotaped deposition in
the Iran-Contra prosecution of former national security adviser John
M. Poindexter.
</P>
<P>
Even in criminal cases, however, the president may be entitled to
unique protections. Although the issue has never been decided, the
Justice Department argued -- when a federal grand jury was
investigating then-Vice President Spiro T. Agnew -- that a sitting
president could not be criminally indicted. Instead, the department
said in a filing by then-Solicitor General Robert H. Bork, the
president cannot be prosecuted until he is impeached or otherwise
leaves office.
</P>
<P>
In civil cases -- like the suit now pending against Clinton -- courts
have been particularly protective of the president. In 1982 the
Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 in Nixon v. Fitzgerald that a president
can never be sued for damages for his official actions -- no matter how
egregious his conduct, and even after he is out of office.
</P>
<P>
The court described a Pentagon whistle-blower's claim as a ``merely
private suit for damages,'' noting the ``lesser public interest'' in
civil cases than in criminal proceedings.
</P>
<P>
The reasoning in the Nixon case can be used to argue either for or
against extending similar protection to a president being sued for his
private actions.
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, the court relied heavily on the need to ensure
that the president, empowered ``to make the most sensitive and
far-reaching decisions entrusted to any official under our
constitutional system,'' should not have to worry about being
subjected to a civil lawsuit every time he acts.
</P>
<P>
Because Jones is complaining about Clinton's conduct before he
became president, Clinton will not be able to argue that the court
should shield him in order to preserve his ability to exercise his
authority and judgment as president.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the court also emphasized what it described as
the ``unique position'' of the president within the constitutional
system and raised two other concerns that Clinton will be able to use
to bolster his case: the threat of proliferating lawsuits against a
target as attractive as the president and the drain on a president's
valuable time and energy of defending himself against a lawsuit.

 Loyal Dog Still an Important Symbol for Japanese (Tokyo) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At last Japan can rest assured: Hachiko's wan-wan was not
a weak one.
</P>
<P>
This is an important cultural discovery. But to understand why, you
need to understand some Japanese dog lore.
</P>
<P>
Between the world wars, in Tokyo's Shibuya section, there lived a
golden brown Akita dog named Hachiko. The famous tale of her loyalty
and devotion to her master is so familiar here that she is universally
known as ``chu-ken Hachiko,'' or ``faithful dog Hachiko.''
</P>
<P>
If a national election were held to pick America's favorite dog,
the votes would probably be split among such diverse candidates as
Lassie, Snoopy, Goofy, Old Yeller and Millie Bush. But in this more
homogeneous nation, where everybody tends to agree with everybody else
on these big cultural questions, there would be no such confusion.
</P>
<P>
Unquestionably, unequivocally, the choice for Japan's favorite dog
would be Hachiko.
</P>
<P>
Hachiko died in 1935, but millions still visit her each year, in
stuffed form, at the National Museum in Tokyo. There are countless
books, movies and CDs, plus statues and plaques commemorating the
faithful dog all over Japan.
</P>
<P>
Because 1994 is the Year of the Dog in the Oriental calendar cycle,
and because it is also the 60th anniversary of the most famous Hachiko
memorial, Japan this spring has launched into a new burst of Hachiko
hagiography.
</P>
<P>
The biggest scoop yet in the media's Hachiko Wars occurred over the
weekend, when the Culture Broadcasting Network obtained a hitherto
unknown recording of Hachiko's bark.
</P>
<P>
It was an old LP record, broken into three pieces. But technicians
at Culture Broadcasting repaired the disk with laser surgery so that
it could be broadcast. After a breathless buildup, a dramatic
introduction and many commercials, the faithful dog's voice was played
for a national audience Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hachiko said, ``Wan-wan.''
</P>
<P>
Wan-wan is the Japanese word for ``bow-wow'' -- that is how the
Japanese render the sound of a dog's bark. For that matter, cats in
Japan say ``nyaah-nyaah '' instead of ``meow,'' and frogs here say
``kero-kero.'' The Japanese word for what a rooster says is
``ko-kek-ko-ko,'' which is, if you think about it, a lot closer to the
real thing than ``cock-a-doodle-doo.''
</P>
<P>
Having a hefty ``wan-wan'' is considered a sign of health and good
karma for a dog here. And to everyone's relief, Hachiko had a healthy,
hearty wan-wan.
</P>
<P>
Even a wimpy wan-wan, however, might not have diminished the
national affection for Hachiko, because her true story crystalizes the
characteristic trustworthiness and loyalty that dog-lovers everywhere
have come to expect from Man's Best Friend.
</P>
<P>
Hachiko, born in 1922, was the pet of Prof. Eisaburo Ueno of Tokyo
University, an institution roughly as prestigious here as Harvard,
Princeton and Stanford combined in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Ueno lived in Shibuya, then considered a suburb but now a very
trendy, up-market Tokyo neighborhood. Every morning, the professor
would walk from his home to Shibuya Station to take the train to work
 -- and every morning Hachiko came with him.
</P>
<P>
Each afternoon, when Ueno came back home on the afternoon train,
Hachiko would be waiting on the platform to meet him. All the other
commuters and the merchants of Shibuya came to know and love the dog
and await her daily vigil.
</P>
<P>
One day in 1925, Ueno died suddenly while at work. Faithful Hachiko
waited and waited at the station that night, but her master did not
come home.
</P>
<P>
So Hachiko came back to wait for her master again the next
afternoon. And the next, and the next. In fact, she kept coming back
to the station, through rain, snow and the occasional earthquake,
every afternoon for the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Word of this real-life wonder dog spread around Japan and the
world. American dog-lovers were so moved that the Los Angeles Friends
of Animals raised funds to commission a statue honoring ``Faithful Dog
Hachiko.'' It was erected at Shibuya Station in 1934 and become the
most famous of many subsequent memorials to the dog.
</P>
<P>
Hachiko died in 1935 and was buried next to her master in Tokyo's
Aoyama Cemetery. But she remained alive in drama, books, movies, songs
and a million bedtime stories.
</P>
<P>
During World War II, Japan's military dictators took an ambivalent
stance toward Hachiko. They made her story mandatory reading in the
schools, to preach the importance of unthinking loyalty to one's
superiors. But they also melted down the famous statue to get metal
for shipbuilding.
</P>
<P>
Hachiko is a powerful retail agent in Japan, and the department
stores here sell Hachiko cookies, cups, calendars, coasters,
calculators, chopstick holders and other memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyu Department store in Shibuya offers, among much else, a
Hachiko necktie (with ``Wan Wan!'' printed on it) for $50 and a $58
wristwatch with Hachiko's face and this message, in English, on the
dial: ``The most heartful Japanese, A dog. He goes to station to meet
with his master.''
</P>
<P>
As for the statue that became a war casualty, it was replaced in
1948 and became nationally famous once again -- so much so that when
Shibuya Station was rebuilt to accommodate increased population, the
architect had to design around Hachiko's statue so that it would not
be disturbed.
</P>
<P>
Hachiko's brand of loyalty to a leader is an important social
virtue in Japan. But so is promptness. Accordingly, the Hachiko statue
at Shibuya Station is also famous as the locus of many lover's
quarrels. A couple makes plans to meet at Hachiko, and then gets into
an argument on the theme of ``Why didn't you get here on time?''
</P>
<P>
To avoid confrontation, the Japanese have placed, at Hachiko's
statue, a machine that lets you punch in on arrival and issues a card
saying what time you arrived.
</P>
<P>
That way you can prove to your lover that you did arrive at Shibuya
Station right on time -- just as Faithful Dog Hachiko did for all those
lonely years.

 Social Security Official to Return Controversial Bonus (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The No. 2 executive at the Social Security
Administration has decided to return a $9,256 bonus he received after
about three months on the job.
</P>
<P>
Social Security principal deputy commissioner Lawrence H. Thompson
``voluntarily decided'' to return the money, the agency's
commissioner, Shirley Chater, told a Senate subcommittee earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
Several House and Senate members had raised questions about
Thompson's award and Social Security's decision to spend $32 million
on employee bonuses last year. More than two-thirds of the agency's
65,000 employees received the bonuses.
</P>
<P>
Chater told the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on human
services that Thompson's award was based on his work at Social
Security and his ``exemplary performance'' at the General Accounting
Office for the nine months he served there before transferring
agencies. Thompson's bonus, she said, ``seemed an appropriate action
at the time.''
</P>
<P>
But Chater said she and Thompson ``both understand the sensitivity
and concern that has been expressed regarding the fact the award was
paid by (Social Security). Consequently, based on this concern and the
basic issues raised by many regarding the fairness and consistency of
the award with current regulations governing their use -- not to
mention how it might adversely affect the future payment of
performance awards to federal employees -- Dr. Thompson has voluntarily
decided to return the entire performance award.''
</P>
<P>
After members of Congress raised questions about the government's
employee bonus program, the Clinton administration issued a
government-wide memorandum urging federal agencies to reexamine how
they award cash bonuses, stressing that bonuses should be linked to
improved performance.
</P>
<P>
Some agencies, such as the Agriculture Department and the U.S.
Information Agency, revamped their bonus programs before the
administration asked for its review.
</P>
<P>
At USIA, for example, Director Joseph Duffey reduced fiscal 1994
funding for bonuses by 85 percent and shifted the money into employee
training programs. The programs include career counseling, training in
new technologies and outplacement assistance for employees whose jobs
are being eliminated.
</P>
<P>
Office of Personnel Management figures for fiscal 1992 show that
the government spent more than $549 million on 759,660 bonuses. The
average award was $724, and the fiscal 1992 bonus money represented
less than 1 percent of the federal payroll.
</P>
<P>
Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., has asked Vice President Gore to address
the role of employee bonuses as part of the administration's effort to
overhaul civil service laws later this year.

 Major's Criticism of Beggars Sparks Controversy (London) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prime Minister John Major's public criticism of street
beggars drew fire from political, religious and civic leaders Sunday
in what is developing into another row for the British government.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with a Bristol newspaper, Major described
panhandling as ``offensive and unjustified'' and called beggars an
``eyesore'' who should be reported to police. The comments, published
Friday, gained wide publicity over the weekend and provoked an outcry
from many quarters.
</P>
<P>
Tony Blair, the Labor Party domestic affairs spokesman who is
favored to be the party's next leader, called Major's statement
bewilderingly petty.
</P>
<P>
Blair said the prime minister was trying to deflect attention away
from bigger problems, such as ``education, a million people under 25
out of work, major problems of putting this country back on its
feet.''
</P>
<P>
``The real criticism of what the prime minister has done is not
only its vindictiveness against some who will be genuinely destitute -- 
it is the notion that this is what we should be concentrating on,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Bishop of Liverpool, the Rt. Rev. David Sheppard, said there is
no justification for attacking society's most ``vulnerable elements.''
</P>
<P>
``I find it a very unlovely feature of public life when people in
power pick on the most despised groups in society rather than asking
what the causes are.''
</P>
<P>
Social workers were equally forceful in their condemnation of
Major, who took over power in 1990 and said he wanted to be the leader
of a classless, caring society.
</P>
<P>
``He is passing the buck. He is having a go at homeless people
because they would appear to be defenseless,'' said Stan Burridge, one
of the organizers of a Sunday rally by homeless protesters.
</P>
<P>
The London rally, planned before Major made his comments, was
intended to commemorate the 600 people estimated to die on Britain's
streets every year. Marchers waved banners saying: ``Beggars cannot be
choosers.''
</P>
<P>
Major was unrepentant during a campaign stop Saturday, saying, ``I
stand by what I said. There is no need for begging.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
And his remarks seemed to strike a responsive chord with many in
the public. The Conservative Party headquarters reported that
telephone calls were running 2-1 in favor of the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, newspapers have printed accounts of organized
gangs of beggars who aggressively accost passersby. One gang operating
on the London subway was reported to be posing as refugees from
Bosnia-Herzegovina and making up to $30,000 a week.
</P>
<P>
In England, beggars have no official status. Police treat them as
vagrants or confidence tricksters, and they are subject to ancient
laws with penalties of up to $1,500. Each year about 1,000 panhandlers
are held for questioning by police.
</P>
<P>
Sheppard, in his comments to BBC Radio, said, ``If there are
aggressive tramps frightening people, yes, they should be reported to
the police and there should be firm action. But that is a tiny handful
of cases.''

 Controversy Flares Over Control of Nazi Files (Berlin) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 100 times a minute, 50,000 times a day, a camera
shutter clicks in a windowless basement in southwest Berlin, capturing
on each frame a fragment of Germany's grim past.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen camera operators labor throughout the day on what some
here say may be the most ambitious microfilming project ever
undertaken: the duplication of 75 million pages of Nazi personnel
documents stored in a former Gestapo eavesdropping post now known as
the Berlin Document Center.
</P>
<P>
The microfilmers work swiftly because on July 1 the U.S. State
Department intends to relinquish custody of the original documents to
the German government. The duplicates -- 8 million feet of film on
38,000 rolls -- will be flown to Washington this summer and deposited
in the National Archives. The Justice Department keeps the right to
unrestricted access to the original files.
</P>
<P>
The pages passing beneath the camera lens range from the prosaic to
the sinister: Heinrich Himmler's expense accounts; Nazi Party
membership card No. 899,895, belonging to one Adolf Eichmann; Josef
Mengele's dental records and membership sheet in the Nazi Physicians
Professional Association; Hermann Goering's suicide notes, scribbled
before he swallowed cyanide in 1946.
</P>
<P>
Among the old files with contemporary relevance is that of Erich
Priebke, a former SS captain now awaiting extradition in Argentina on
charges of helping to murder 335 Italians in Rome's Adreatine Caves in
1944.
</P>
<P>
Returning the original documents to German custody is another
milestone in the restoration of German sovereignty after a
half-century of Allied occupation. But the proposed transfer has met
resistance. Historians, Jewish groups and Nazi hunters have bitterly
objected to the State Department's plan. They complain that
restrictive German privacy laws will hamper access to the original
documents, that the National Archives duplicates will not be available
for at least two years and that surrendering the files is morally
wrong.
</P>
<P>
``We bought those documents with the most precious commodity we
have: the blood of our young boys and the other Allied forces that had
to fight the Nazi menace in order to liberate the world,'' Elan
Steinberg, executive director of the World Jewish Congress, said in a
telephone interview from New York. ``I'm reminded of the old saying
that if it ain't broke, don't fix it,'' he said. ``The Berlin Document
Center ain't broke right now, and I don't know why we're trying to fix
it.''
</P>
<P>
Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., who led hearings on the document center
last month, has threatened a full debate in Congress ``on Germany's
Nazi past'' unless Bonn and the State Department resolve the
controversy.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
recently promised Jewish leaders that rules governing access to the
original documents will remain in line with U.S. regulations until the
National Archives duplicates are ready for viewing. U.S. Embassy
officials in Bonn are trying to hammer out the details.
</P>
<P>
``This is something that has been negotiated over quite a long
period of time and has been reviewed from every angle that I can
imagine. When concerns have been raised, they've been reviewed
again,'' said Dan Hamilton, policy adviser to Richard Holbrooke, the
U.S. ambassador to Germany.
</P>
<P>
Donald Kobletz, the State Department's lawyer in Berlin in the
1980s and now a private attorney here, said: ``Can you tell a
sovereign government, one of your closest allies, that 50 years after
the war you don't really trust them to keep their own records? After
getting microfilm copies, paid for by the German government? I would
consider it a gratuitous irritation to our relationship that really
isn't warranted.''
</P>
<P>
Many of the files were seized by Allied troops driving across
Germany -- such as some 10.7 million Nazi Party membership cards
impounded by American soldiers at a Bavarian paper mill as the SS
prepared to reduce them to pulp. The cards provided useful evidence
for prosecutors at the Nazi War Crimes tribunal in Nuremburg.
</P>
<P>
Ever since, the archives have proved invaluable for historians
scrutinizing the Third Reich, for German officials sorting out
immigration requests and for Nazi-hunters looking for culprits. Last
year the center processed 27,000 requests for information from
official agencies and 1,300 from private individuals such as scholars
and journalists.
</P>
<P>
Although few files in this collection contain direct documentation
of mass murder, the information often helps corroborate other
evidence. ``When a guy writes in his resume, `I was assigned to KZ
(concentration camp) Auschwitz,' and he signs it, it's difficult for
him to later claim that he wasn't there,'' said David Marwell, 42, the
center's director.
</P>
<P>
As early as 1952, U.S. officials began discussing the eventual
return of the archives to German control. Many other documents, such
as papers from the Third Reich foreign ministry, were given to the
Germans decades ago after being microfilmed for the National Archives'
Captured German Documents division.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations over the Berlin Document Center were abandoned in the
late 1960s, however, because of U.S. government concerns that
Germany's proposed rules of access ``were unacceptably restrictive of
private scholarly access,'' Peters told Lantos' hearing last month.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, German officials for years privately hinted that they
were content to have such sensitive material remain in American hands.
``I don't think the Germans really wanted the documents,'' said
Kobletz, the former State Department lawyer. ``... It's a bit of a hot
potato for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
The potato got hotter in the 1980s when it was discovered that an
estimated 10,000 pages had been stolen from the archives and sold to
memorabilia collectors willing to pay up to $3,000 for each signature
of a high-ranking Nazi. Marwell was dispatched to Berlin to overhaul
security procedures.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, the German parliament voted unanimously to ask that the
center be remanded to German custody. The microfilming project, which
had begun in 1968 only to stop in 1972, resumed. Last October, the
State Department signed an agreement to relinquish the archive on July
1.
</P>
<P>
In bulk alone the collection is staggering, covering roughly eight
miles of stacked paper. Among the party membership cards is that of
Oskar Schindler -- party No. 6,421,477 -- and Amon Goeth, No. 510,964,
the sadistic commandant of Plaszow concentration camp in Poland; both
men were portrayed in the recent film ``Schindler's List.''
</P>
<P>
Much of the current controversy was stirred by a magazine article
in the New Yorker by writer Gerald Posner, who questioned both the
quality of the microfilming and the potential pitfalls in German
privacy laws. The article contends, for example, that microfilm fails
to distinguish between different colored inks used on some documents
and renders some writing less legible.
</P>
<P>
More significant perhaps are concerns about whether German
archivists would hinder legitimate scholarship. German privacy law
typically prohibits access to files on people until they have been
dead for at least 30 years.
</P>
<P>
However, as to the issue of accessing the original documents,
Marwell expressed confidence that the German government will prove to
be a fair administrator. Since 1988, Germany's Federal Archives has
had the authority to screen requests from German citizens for entry
into the Berlin Document Center; German officials contend that only
one request from a scholar and less than 1 percent of requests from
private citizens have been denied. Moreover, under the agreement
signed last October, the Justice Department keeps the right to
unrestricted access to the files.
</P>
<P>
``For the kind of access that people are concerned about -- 
scholarship and Nazi war crime investigations -- people won't see a
difference,'' Marwell said. ``Absent some dramatic change, I don't
think scholars have anything to worry about.''

 Rightist Israelis Vow to Block Arafat Visit to Jerusalem (Jerusalem) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Yasser Arafat wants to return to the city he says he
was born in, he may be greeted at the entrance to Jerusalem by angry
mobs led by the city's mayor.
</P>
<P>
Right-wing Israelis, spurred on by Jerusalem's new mayor, Ehud
Olmert, have vowed to block any attempt by the chairman of the
Palestine Liberation Organization to visit Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
There are no announced plans yet for Arafat to try to visit, but
already they are laying out an unwelcome mat:
</P>
<P>
-- A deputy mayor of the city last week offered the city's top award
to anyone who would ``liquidate'' Arafat.
</P>
<P>
-- A Jewish settler's group proposed offering a 100,000 shekel reward
(about $33,000) for the capture of Arafat ``dead or alive.''
</P>
<P>
-- Olmert has vowed to rally 500,000 demonstrators to block Arafat's
arrival, warning ominously of a massacre with ``10 times as many
victims'' as the Hebron shooting spree Feb. 25 that killed 30 Muslims.
</P>
<P>
``This is something that would be potentially explosive'' if Arafat
arrives, said Aliza Kristt, a spokeswoman for Olmert, who is traveling
abroad. ``It would turn the city upside-down and inside-out.''
</P>
<P>
Arafat is expected to arrive in June in the West Bank town of
Jericho and the Gaza Strip, the first areas of Palestinian autonomy
under the Israel-PLO agreement signed in September.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time the man who led a 30-year struggle of
violence and diplomacy for the Palestinian cause will be in the West
Bank since shortly after Israel's occupation in 1967.
</P>
<P>
He has made no request to visit Jerusalem, although he has often
used the image of a return to the city as a rhetorical rallying cry.
</P>
<P>
Arafat claims that he was born in Jerusalem's Old City in a poor
neighborhood -- now demolished -- near the Western Wall, a site holy to
Jews. Other evidence suggests that he was born in Cairo, Egypt, and
the issue never has been settled.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials expect eventually that they will face an attempt
by Arafat to pray in Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa Mosque on the Temple Mount,
Islam's third-holiest site and destination for Muslim pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
It will put them in an awkward spot. Israel has long boasted that
it guarantees freedom of religion at all the holy shrines in
Jerusalem, including Christian and Muslim shrines. The government
would be hard-pressed to deny a prayer visit by a leader with whom
they have signed a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
But such a visit would be a large event for the Arabs here, and
could turn into a triumphal entry of the Palestinian leader to a city
he has vowed should be the Palestinian capital.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem was physically divided between Arabs and Jews until 1967,
when Israel evicted Jordanian troops from East Jerusalem during the
Six Day War. Although about 160,000 Arabs remain there, Israel has
officially annexed Jerusalem and has sworn that it will be the
``eternal, undivided capital'' of the Jewish state. It's a claim that
most countries, including the United States, do not recognize.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians have not relinquished their claim to Jerusalem, and a
draft Palestinian constitution divulged last week refers to Jerusalem
as the eventual capital. Israel and the PLO have agreed that it is an
``unresolved issue'' to be on table of final negotiations scheduled to
start in two years.

 On the Road Again: Entrepreneurs Move With the Seasons (Fort Myers) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
FORT MYERS, Fla.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sometime next month, Walt and Sandy Lamkin will
hit the road again, fleeing Florida's summer with their trailer full
of wares for the fairgrounds and festivals of New England -- and the
hope of bigger crowds, more money and a little middle-age security.
</P>
<P>
They'll head north in their live-in van, the dog, Brandy, stretched
out by the stove and the Amazon parrot, Envy, perched on a bunk bed,
offering an acceptable version of ``Zippidy do dah.'' The trailer they
tow will be so jammed with goods -- everything from contour pillows to
jewelry to disposable rain jackets (two for $1) -- that Lamkin will
have to shoulder the door to secure the lock.
</P>
<P>
In another life, the Lamkins were worth several million dollars.
Then in the early '80s, the bottom fell out of the egg-and-poultry
business in Maine and they lost their 1,500-acre farm. They moved to
Florida to start over -- after a couple of false starts -- as members of
the growing class of entrepreneurs who peddle wares from town to town
and consider storefronts, leases and 800-phone numbers an unseemly
symbol of settlement.
</P>
<P>
From California to Florida, thousands of Americans are on the road
like the Lamkins these days, moving with the seasons, plying their
trade at flea markets and trade shows. They may sell fine silverware
or antiques, T-shirts or gadgets that slice, dice and cut in a single
swipe. Bt each is united by his or her disdain of having to punch a
time clock or answer to a boss.
</P>
<P>
Like the drummers of the Old West -- the salesmen who traveled from
town to town, hawking medicines and housewares from the backs of their
wagons -- today's itinerant vendors play to the most basic American
instinct: Every home can afford a bargain. They are survivors,
possessed of modest dreams, content to pursue a decent living and the
freedom to move on when business is lean.
</P>
<P>
By 7:30 a.m. the other Friday, the Lamkins had set up four tables
in the space they rent for $60 a weekend at Fleamaster's flea market
in Fort Myers. The covered, open-air market -- one of more than 150
that operate year-round in Florida -- attracts 800 vendors and 30,000
customers on a busy weekend.
</P>
<P>
``I don't care what I sell,'' said Walt Lamkin, 54. ``All I want is
a good product that no one else has. That's the magic, finding the
product. ...
</P>
<P>
``Battery-operated talking parrots are big this year, and I never
would have guessed that. Take the nice cooler with a two-quart jug I
found. I said everybody's going to want that. I bought 72 of them for
$8 each. I marked them up to $14.95. They didn't sell and I kept
dropping the price because you can't let your money sit around. I just
sold the last one the other day, for $5.''
</P>
<P>
The early crowds were sparse on this morning. The sellers were
middle-aged and many had come to this line of work because they had
failed at some earlier business or had retired and didn't want to be
idle. With Florida emptying as summer approached, most had plotted
their escape to points north and west.
</P>
<P>
``Eight years ago, I came down to Florida as a commercial
fisherman,'' said George Nichol, standing among tables stocked with
jellies, greeting cards, cotton ear swabs, chamois clothes, men's
dress belts, billy clubs and rolls of rope. ``It was a lot of work for
no money. Pulling 70-pound traps of stone crabs 300 times a day, out
from dawn to dusk, getting eaten by a brutal sun -- that's a job for
young people, and I was lucky enough to realize it. You got to have a
lot of luck to be old these days.''
</P>
<P>
Nearby, Norm and Cathy Bricker had parked the 40-foot motor home
they live in next to their Rising Sun Traders jewelry counter. Their
11-year-old son, Aaron, whose schooling is done by correspondence
courses, was organizing the baseball cards that he will sell and swap
when the family leaves for Arizona, California, Alaska and Montana.
</P>
<P>
``When Norm wanted to sell off the farm and go on the road ...
about 10 years ago, I was dead set against it,'' Cathy Bricker said.
``But now I wouldn't be caught dead living in the same place. I feel
antsy just visiting my parents in Maryland.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
After the Lamkins lost their Maine farm in 1982 and their Florida
tire shop to fire in 1990, their net worth was down to $500. They
bought $300 worth of canned food, figuring that would sustain them for
a couple of months, and spent the final $200 on cashews and pecans.
They sold them at a flea market and have been among the modern-day
drummers ever since.
</P>
<P>
``I tried to get a regular job,'' Walt said, ``but hell, I was 50
years old with a degree in agriculture. No one was going to hire me.
So you do what you got to do to survive. Actually, I've got no
complaints. The egg business was good to me for 20 years. We raised
two boys we're proud of. We're paying our bills now. Hell, I'm as
happy as if I had brains.''
</P>
<P>
By the time the flea market closed, the Lamkins' receipts totaled
$205, less than half what they had taken in the previous Friday.
``That's why it's time to get out of Florida,'' Walt mumbled. ``You
can't live on that.''

Speculation is growing in Washington that Secretary of

this summer. Christopher is scheduled to travel to Bangkok, Thailand,

BROWN VS. BROWN: Sen. Hank Brown, R-Colo., says he has enough
``clear commitments'' from both Democrats and Republicans to defeat
the nomination of former anti-war activist Sam W. Brown Jr. as
ambassador to the Vienna-based Conference on Security and Cooperation
in Europe. The Northern California businessman, who is no relation to
the GOP senator, has been tapped by President Clinton to head the U.S.
delegation to the organization that oversees arms control and security
agreements in Europe. But his confirmation is being filibustered by
Senate Republicans who note that Brown's only military experience was
as a prominent organizer of nationwide protests against the Vietnam
War. ... Echoes of the divisions that split the nation 20 years ago
reverberated on the Senate floor last week as Democrats twice failed
to muster the three-fifths majority needed to break the filibuster and
vote on Brown's confirmation. But Sen. Brown insisted that nominee
Brown's Vietnam record is not the issue. ``It's not the war,'' he
said. ``That issue's behind us. The real concern is that Sam Brown is
not qualified.''

LINING UP: Out in the real world, the hot tickets are to World Cup

committee hearings, which are frequently held in small rooms with far
fewer seats than lobbyists who want to sit in them. ... And now the
Capitol's police force is investigating whether some lobbyists are
getting in illegally by paying friendly congressional staff members,
who have keys to the House and Senate office buildings, to go inside
before the buildings are open to the public and stand in line for
them. If they are, the staffers in their employ would be violating
congressional rules prohibiting anyone in an ``official position''
from using that position to gain outside employment. ... Chris Van
Horn, owner of the CVK Group, which provides ``line-standing''
services to lobbyists, has complained that his place-holders -- mostly
college students -- have found as many as 10 people in line ahead of
them when they entered office buildings at their 7 a.m. opening.

 Honecker, Builder of Berlin Wall, Dies of Cancer at 81 (Santiago) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SANTIAGO, Chile
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Erich Honecker, the former East German Communist
leader who built the Cold War's most chilling monument, the infamous
Berlin Wall, died of liver cancer Sunday here at his home in exile. He
was 81.
</P>
<P>
Honecker, who ruled for 18 years before the collapse of communism,
had lived in Chile with his wife and his daughter's family since
January 1993, when Berlin judges ruled he was too ill to stand trial
in connection with shootings at the Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
He lived his final days in sickness and bitterness, according to
Chilean friends, still a committed Communist who fretted about the
``social deterioration'' of reunified Germany.
</P>
<P>
Although Honecker led the Communist East German state between 1971
and 1989, he will be remembered most for what he did long before -- 
building the Wall.
</P>
<P>
In many ways, the structure served as a metaphor for the
uncompromising, neo-Stalinist views Honecker held throughout his rule.
</P>
<P>
His regime fostered the most pervasive secret police organization
in Communist Europe, penned in its people and shot those who tried to
flee to the West.
</P>
<P>
Honecker's successor as head of the East German state, Egon Krenz,
on Sunday pleaded for ``a fair judgment'' on Honecker's life. ``He
wanted to realize the dream of humanism.''
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman for German Chancellor Helmut Kohl stated that
Honecker had failed in his political goals.
</P>
<P>
``His policies brought harm to countless people,'' said government
spokesman Dieter Vogel. ``Erich Honecker failed. Perhaps he didn't
recognize it, but history gave proof of his failure.''
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, news of Honecker's death drew shrugs of indifference in
his homeland.
</P>
<P>
``At this point I couldn't care less about Honecker, and I'm sure
the same goes for most East Germans,'' said Klaus Sternberg, a teacher
in Schwerin.
</P>
<P>
``He's in heaven now, and he can sit down with Marx, Engels and
Lenin and think over what went wrong,'' said Lutz Wagner, a salesman
in eastern Berlin.
</P>
<P>
In the early part of his 18 years in power, Honecker enjoyed
success. But later, poor health, advanced age and political isolation
left him increasingly vulnerable to the winds of change sweeping the
region.
</P>
<P>
An unbending hard-liner, he disliked the Soviet Union's
reform-minded leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and was deeply suspicious
of the liberalization under way in other parts of Moscow's empire.
</P>
<P>
In the end, Honecker was toppled by the massive anti-government
street demonstrations that marked the decisive phase of the 1989 East
German revolution.
</P>
<P>
His control over the East German state had been so complete, and
his fall so sudden, that Politburo colleagues who witnessed his
political demise said Honecker was incapable of grasping what had
happened.
</P>
<P>
Krenz has said that when he informed the ousted leader of his
expulsion from the Communist Party, Honecker ``had not understood at
all'' the contents of the message.
</P>
<P>
In his 1980 memoirs, ``About My Life,'' Honecker described proudly
how, as the Politburo member responsible for state security, he
organized the operation that in a matter of a few pre-dawn hours on
Aug. 13, 1961, cut one of Europe's largest cities in two, closed the
last remaining hole in the Iron Curtain and stunned the West.
</P>
<P>
``At midnight the alarm was sounded and the action began,'' he
wrote. ``With it began an operation that ... would make the world take
notice. Later we determined with satisfaction that we had forgotten
nothing essential (in the preparations).''
</P>
<P>
The 100-mile-long, heavily fortified wall through and around West
Berlin endured for 28 years as the most compelling symbol of an
ideologically divided world.
</P>
<P>
It was almost 10 years after supervising the Wall's construction
that Honecker succeeded Walter Ulbricht as Communist Party boss and de
facto East German leader.
</P>
<P>
Honecker was driven from power three weeks before the Wall's
collapse in November 1989 in a series of events that heralded the fall
of Soviet bloc communism itself.
</P>
<P>
The concrete barrier that he and other members of the East German
hierarchy called the ``anti-fascist protection wall'' had effectively
halted the westward flight of skilled manpower that threatened to
bleed the Communist state to economic death.
</P>
<P>
For all its horror, Western economic and political analysts
subsequently admitted that the Wall enabled East Germany to survive as
a poorer neighbor of a highly successful West German state.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Born Aug. 25, 1912, in the western town of Neunkirchen as the third
of six children of a coal miner, Honecker began his political career
at the age of 10 by joining a Communist youth group. At 18, he became
a full party member, quickly taking on responsibility in the Saarland
region for stirring the party's youth into street actions during the
tumultuous final days of Germany's Weimar Republic.
</P>
<P>
Spotted by the party's leadership as a future talent, Honecker was
sent to Moscow's Communist Youth International School for a year and
returned to become youth propaganda chief for his home region at age
19.
</P>
<P>
After Adolf Hitler's Nazis seized power in 1933, Honecker worked
surreptitiously to stir resistance among factory workers in several
parts of Germany, including the industrial Ruhr Valley.
</P>
<P>
He was finally arrested in Berlin by the Nazi secret police, the
Gestapo, convicted in 1936 of treason and sentenced to 10 years in
prison. He remained there until advancing Allied forces reached his
prison, 30 miles west of Berlin, and freed him in the fading days of
World War II.
</P>
<P>
His comparatively light sentence and preferential treatment during
his imprisonment led to persistent rumors that he had cooperated in
some way with his Nazi captors.
</P>
<P>
Those rumors continued virtually to the end, with reports that at
the crucial 1989 Politburo meeting where Honecker was toppled, East
German secret police chief Erich Mielke finally forced a reluctant
Honecker to give up power by threatening to publicize apparently
damning evidence relating to his actions in prison.
</P>
<P>
After his release from prison in the Soviet-controlled occupation
zone, Honecker, then 33, joined the newly formed Communist hierarchy
that would eventually lead the East German state.
</P>
<P>
Initially responsible for the reconstituted Communist youth
organization, the Free German Youth, he joined the Politburo as
security chief in 1958, later planning the Berlin Wall operation and
emerging as Ulbricht's heir apparent.
</P>
<P>
Friends of Honecker hailed him as a lifelong anti-fascist. Luis
Corvalan, former secretary general of the Chilean Communist Party,
said Honecker had been ``a great comrade, a great Communist who showed
solidarity with the Chilean people.''
</P>
<P>
After the Chilean armed forces overthrew Socialist President
Salvador Allende in 1973, thousands of leftists fled into exile and an
estimated 5,000 of them took up residence in the former East Germany.
</P>
<P>
Allende's widow, Hortensia Bussi de Allende, was among the Chilean
leftists who paid their respects to Honecker's widow, Margot, and
their daughter, Sonja, Sunday at their home in a closed condominium
complex in Santiago. Honecker had another daughter, Erika, by an
earlier marriage.
</P>
<P>
Sunday afternoon, a hearse took Honecker's body to Santiago's
general cemetery for a wake. A police spokesman said a funeral service
would be held there Monday and the body would be cremated. He did not
know whether the remains would be taken to Germany.

 North Korea Warned to Accept Monitoring of Nuclear Reactors (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a breakdown in talks between a U.N. team and
North Korea, U.S. lawmakers issued new warnings Sunday about the
consequences if the Pyongyang regime does not agree to international
monitoring to prevent development of a nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
Calling the defense of South Korea a ``sacred obligation,'' Sen.
Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said the North Korean government's brinkmanship could
ultimately endanger its survival.
</P>
<P>
Pyongyang ``should make no mistake about our dedication, our
intention and our absolute firmness in continuing the course of making
sure they do not become a nuclear weapons state,'' Nunn said on NBC's
``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
Tensions heightened this weekend when North Korea announced it
would continue unloading spent fuel at its main Yongbyon nuclear
reactor, but would ``never allow'' the International Atomic Energy
Agency, or IAEA, to inspect the facility to determine whether fuel has
been secretly diverted from energy to weapons use.
</P>
<P>
North Korea has repeatedly denied it has any form of nuclear
weapons program, but U.S. intelligence agencies believe that enough
enriched plutonium has been siphoned off to make one or two crude
bombs.
</P>
<P>
After talks broke down Saturday, part of the IAEA team left North
Korea, abruptly ending the latest effort in the 16-month crisis that
has swung erratically between near-calamity and tentative cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The collapse could open the way for punitive U.N. economic
sanctions, which North Korea has said it would treat as an act of war.
</P>
<P>
``We don't want a war,'' added Nunn, who is chairman of the Senate
Armed Services Committee. But ``if North Korea brings a war in
reaction to any kind of sanctions, then they will bring about the
destruction of their own country.''
</P>
<P>
For months, the Clinton administration has tried a carrot-and-stick
strategy to engage the outlaw state, offering diplomatic and economic
incentives in exchange for cooperation on its nuclear program.
Pyongyang's latest actions indicate that tactic may have failed.
</P>
<P>
Nunn said Pyongyang faces three alternatives -- and three different
responses:
</P>
<P>
First, cooperation, which would be rewarded with membership in the
family of nations through ``trade and intercourse.''
</P>
<P>
Second, resisting nuclear weapons monitoring, which would cause ``a
very serious financial situation, which could lead to their own
disintegration.''
</P>
<P>
And third, aggression, which would bring decisive military defeat.
</P>
<P>
``The North Koreans are playing brinkmanship -- this is their
historical pattern -- but playing this game has very dangerous
consequences,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
Saying there are still methods of avoiding military confrontation,
Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., suggested that the Clinton administration
exert pressure through Japan's economic ties and China's energy links.
</P>
<P>
``So you have two vises right there that can begin to squeeze, that
might indeed take place if there were ever economic sanctions voted at
the U.N. against North Korea,'' he said, also on ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
U.N. Security Council members met Friday to discuss the standoff,
and more talks are scheduled at the United Nations on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the crisis appeared to take on new urgency when the
IAEA, the U.N. nuclear monitoring agency, notified the Security
Council that North Korea was removing the reactor's fuel rods so
quickly that evidence of diverting fuel to a weapons program could be
erased ``within days.''
</P>
<P>
International concern has mounted further over the weekend with
reports out of Japan that North Korea may soon test an advanced
version of the Rodong 1 missile, which could reach most of western
Japan.
</P>
<P>
Military analysts believe the missile would be capable of carrying
a nuclear warhead if it were refitted for that purpose.

 Officials of Rwandan Rump Government Flee Headquarters (Nairobi) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NAIROBI, Kenya
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials of Rwanda's self-declared government
fled their headquarters Sunday for a border town in western Rwanda,
according to diplomats in Kigali, the capital.
</P>
<P>
The rump government, composed of militant ethnic Hutus, abandoned
the town of Gitarama as rebel troops of the Rwandan Patriotic Front
advanced on it, said the diplomats, who were quoted by the Reuter news
agency. The rebel group is dominated by the minority Tutsi tribe.
</P>
<P>
The diplomats said the Hutu leaders fled a civil servants' college
outside Gitarama where they had made their headquarters, heading west
by road or helicopter toward Kibuya, on Lake Kivu, which borders
Zaire. The fall of Gitarama, 25 miles south of Kigali, would bring the
rebels closer to their goal of an outright victory in the vicious,
seven-week-old civil war, and would mark a major psychological defeat
for the Hutu militants.
</P>
<P>
``Most of the government has gone to Kibuya and others are already
abroad,'' Reuter quoted one diplomat as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Hutu militants, who control the state's army, helped organize a
pogrom against Tutsis last month after the Hutu president, Juvenal
Habyarimana, died in a suspicious plane crash. In an offensive on
Kigali, the smaller but better organized Rwandan Patriotic Front
forced the Hutu leadership to withdraw to Gitarama. Now, the Hutu
militant forces -- including army units and militias -- are concentrated
in the west and the southwest around Butare.
</P>
<P>
The Tutsi-led front controls large chunks of Kigali, including the
airport, and most of the north, east and south of Rwanda. Its leaders
refer to the Hutu-proclaimed government as a ``clique of killers'' and
have refused direct negotiations with it.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-based human rights group Human Rights Watch/Africa has
said at least four officials of the rump government were key
instigators and organizers of Rwanda's ethnic slaughter -- including
its president, Theodore Sindikubwabo, prime minister, Jean Kambanda,
and defense minister, Augustin Bizimana.
</P>
<P>
From the time of the government's creation, however, it was unclear
how much real control they exercised over the Rwandan armed forces and
the roving bands of machete-wielding militiamen who began the
slaughter that has left an estimated quarter-million Rwandans dead.
Human Rights Watch/Africa, in a report this month on Rwanda's
violence, said, ``Although much of the violence is still controlled by
authorities of the hardline (Hutu) parties, the rump government, or
the Rwandan army, random killing, especially in the course of banditry
and pillage, is growing as well.''
</P>
<P>
With the international community horrified by Rwanda's widespread
killing, but paralyzed by confusion and fear about how to respond,
many diplomats and human rights advocates have quietly expressed hope
for a quick rebel victory as the most likely way to end the bloodshed.
The front also has been accused of random killing and other abuses,
but human rights groups say violations by the rebels do not appear
systematic or centrally directed.
</P>
<P>
The offensive on Kigali also continued Sunday, with heavy artillery
pounding the city overnight and small arms fire forcing the United
Nations to suspend convoys in which it has been evacuating civilians
trapped by the fighting. With tens of thousands of civilians
reportedly fleeing Kigali along the main highway south, the rebels
faced the prospect of taking over the capital and finding it largely
deserted. The roads south were said to be clogged with refugees and
some government soldiers, fleeing the rebel advance.
</P>
<P>
Two relief flights landed Sunday with food at Kigali's airport, but
intense small arms and mortar fire prevented food from being
distributed in the city, according to new agency reports. A mortar
shell apparently struck the Gitiga orphanage in the capital, wounding
six children.

 Clinton's Leadership to Be Put to Test During Europe Trip (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As President Clinton prepares to depart for Europe
this week to commemorate the 50th anniversary of D-day, he faces the
challenge of asserting America's -- and his own -- leadership in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Speaking across a generational chasm and addressing himself to
veterans of a military whose later mission in Vietnam he and others
vehemently opposed, Clinton confronts an important test of his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
Can the 47-year-old Clinton persuade a skeptical world that he and
his fellow postwar baby boomers are ready to assume the mantle of
leadership? Can he summon a nation and its allies to deal with a world
whose threats are far more diffuse and ambivalent than the unvarnished
evils of Nazism and fascism?
</P>
<P>
And can he present a coherent view of American engagement in the
world despite a foreign policy record marked by vacillation on Bosnia,
retreat in Somalia and Haiti and reversal on human rights in China?
</P>
<P>
The way the world and the American public come to answer those
questions will have a lasting effect on how much Clinton will
accomplish in his presidency. Clinton hopes that by proving himself a
strong spokesman for America's ideals abroad, he can boost his
credibility at home despite questions about his character and
competence.
</P>
<P>
Aides say the key themes of the European trip will be homage to the
heroes of the ``Great Crusade'' of World War II and a vision of the
future based on the triumph of democracy.
</P>
<P>
As Clinton speaks against the backdrop of American military
cemeteries in Italy, Britain and France, he and millions of television
viewers will be reminded of the painful legacy of the bloodiest
century in human history.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who was born after the war ended, will be shadowed not
only by his own draft-avoiding past but also by the specter of former
President Reagan.
</P>
<P>
Reagan, who spent World War II in Hollywood making training and
propaganda films for the Army, staged what many consider the most
effective piece of political theater of his presidency on the cliffs
above the Normandy beaches during the 1984 ceremonies celebrating the
40th anniversary of the D-day landings.
</P>
<P>
White House aides say they know that comparisons with Reagan's
stirring performance are inevitable, but they contend they are
irrelevant. In 1984, they say, the United States was still engaged in
a great moral struggle against communism and Reagan's words about the
heroes of Normandy carried a resonance that cannot be reproduced
today.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will instead try to summon up the valor of the struggle
against fascism and make it apply to the effort to consolidate
democracy in the nations of the former Soviet empire and elsewhere
around the globe.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Aides involved in planning the trip and polishing the keynote
speeches said there will be no chest-thumping over the Allied military
triumph of World War II.
</P>
<P>
``Let me emphasize this: This should not be seen as a victory over
Germany and over Italy,'' said national security adviser Anthony Lake.
``I think the president will be trying to make it clear that we are
not celebrating the defeat of certain nations; we are celebrating the
victory of an idea, a liberating idea, of democracy.''
</P>
<P>
Lake said Clinton intends to honor not only the veterans of the war
but also those political and military leaders who shaped the postwar
world, rebuilt the shattered economies of Europe and Japan and led the
West in its costly victory in the Cold War.

 Democrats Try to Minimize Damage to Health Care Reform (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With skepticism mounting about the fate of the health
care reform initiative, key Democrats tried Sunday to minimize the
damage from House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski's
looming legal troubles.
</P>
<P>
The committee ``is going to get a bill out no matter what happens,
and we're going to have it on the floor in July,'' House Majority
Leader Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., predicted. ``The committee has
already done a lot on health care. We're going to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
Gephardt and others, appearing on ABC's ``This Week With David
Brinkley,'' said there are many forces working to ensure passage of a
health care reform bill this congressional session and that the
legislation's future does not depend solely on the chairman of the
powerful House panel.
</P>
<P>
Health care reform ``is bigger than any one person,'' said White
House senior adviser George Stephanopoulos, adding: ``There is great
momentum right now to make sure we get health care reform. ... We're
confident we will be able to work with whoever is chairman of the
committee. ... We're going to get this done this year.''
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski has a Tuesday deadline for accepting a plea bargain
that would require his resignation and a probable jail term. The
alternative would be an indictment and potential trial on corruption
charges. There have been allegations that he has taken illegal cash
payments from the House post office and listed employees on his
payroll who did not do any work.
</P>
<P>
He has denied any wrongdoing and, according to sources, is now
inclined to fight the charges. Under Democratic caucus rules, he would
have to abandon his chairmanship if indicted.
</P>
<P>
Rep. Charles B. Rangel, D-N.Y., the third-ranking Democrat on the
Ways and Means Committee, said on the ABC program that Rostenkowski's
skill was in ``being able to fully understand the needs of the
different regions, the needs of members who had to vote for (health
care reform) .... In talking to people, he will know those who can
vote for it, and those who can't.''
</P>
<P>
Rangel insisted that ``with the presumption of innocence still
going,'' he expected Rostenkowski to continue to work to ensure
passage of a health care measure ``because he is really committed to
this piece of legislation.''
</P>
<P>
But House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., speaking on CBS'
``Face the Nation,'' said that recent Republican House victories,
particularly in Kentucky and Oklahoma, signal more problems for
passage of President Clinton's reform bill than the potential loss of
the influential chairman.
</P>
<P>
Those Republicans ran against Clinton's policies, including his
plan for overhauling the nation's health care system.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich said he was concerned that Rostenkowski might get a
lenient plea bargain through Democratic influence. He cited ``the
weird situation where the president's lawyer is negotiating with the
president's Justice Department on behalf of the president's health
care leader in the House.''
</P>
<P>
Robert S. Bennett, who is Rostenkowski's lawyer, is also
representing Clinton in a sexual-harassment lawsuit filed by a former
Arkansas state employee.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich said he was worried that the result would be ``some kind
of rigged deal where 15 or 20 felony counts magically get reduced to a
misdemeanor to allow him to stay in charge of health care.''

 Capitalist Ambitions Reflected in Ancient City (Shanghai) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SHANGHAI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Percy Chu's eyes glisten as he recalls Shanghai in the
decades before the 1949 communist revolution, when it was ``the Paris
of the East,'' pulsating with Jazz Age energy. It was Asia's most
cosmopolitan city, a hub of free-wheeling capitalism, high intrigue,
bacchanalian night life and brazen crime.
</P>
<P>
Chu, 95, was a prominent banker in those days. Among his prized
mementos is a 1940 newspaper clipping reporting his abduction by an
armed gang so audacious that its extortion letters bore a return
address. ``I survived,'' Chu said. ``I've survived a lot of things.''
</P>
<P>
Now heady times are returning to Shanghai -- and the city's old
capitalists such as Chu are gaining a new lease on their
pre-revolutionary way of life.
</P>
<P>
After four decades of stagnation and decay under communism,
Shanghai is bidding to regain the glory it once enjoyed as a center of
international finance and trade. The city's rulers are wooing foreign
investors and spending massive amounts on public works in an effort to
build a glittering nexus of commerce on old Shanghai's faded ruins.
They aim for the city to rival Asia's modern urban jewels such as Hong
Kong and Singapore within the next two decades.
</P>
<P>
The endeavor underscores the extraordinary sense of hope and
progress engendered by China's explosive growth as its economy
converts from state planning to free enterprise. Given Shanghai's
dreadful overcrowding and antiquated infrastructure -- the majority of
homes still lack flush toilets -- the city's aspirations are ambitious
to say the least. But the atmosphere of rejuvenation has aroused the
capitalistic spirits for which Shanghai used to be famous, fueling one
of the most spectacular boons in China's reform era.
</P>
<P>
Members of Shanghai's old money elite are back in clover. Chu, for
example, belongs to an organization of elderly Shanghainese stripped
of their assets during the communist era and brutally bullied by Mao
Zedong's Red Guards. The group, using money that had been repatriated
by the authorities, recently helped launch a local construction
company, whose shares have soared on the Shanghai stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
Chinese companies that left Shanghai after 1949 are streaming back
with an eye to tapping its burgeoning markets and employing China's
best-educated work force at wage levels that are rock-bottom by world
standards.
</P>
<P>
Chung Shing Textile Co., whose late founder fled Shanghai for
Taiwan, has formed a joint venture with the Shanghai apparel factory
it had owned before the plant was nationalized by the communists. The
Sincere department store chain of Hong Kong, whose flagship store on
Shanghai's Nanking Road was also nationalized, opened a glitzy new
store last year a few doors from the site of the old one.
</P>
<P>
Multinational companies from the United States, Europe and Japan
are also pouring billions of dollars a year into offices, factories,
bank branches, chemical plants and distribution facilities. Among
them: AT T Corp., Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Citibank, Morgan Stanley 
Co., Volkswagen AG, Unilever, Toshiba Corp., Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co. and Hitachi Ltd.
</P>
<P>
``Two years ago we had 54 members,'' said Diane Long, president of
the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai. ``Now there's 313 -- I
mean, there were 313 a week ago.'' The number is rising so fast, she
explained, ``I don't know what it is today.''
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic development is taking place in a section of the
city on the eastern bank of the Huangpu River, named Pudong. Nearly
2,000 foreign-funded ventures are either completed or underway in
Pudong, including a giant department store backed by the Hong
Kong-based retailer Yaohan; a spandex-manufacturing venture bankrolled
by DuPont Co.; and an air-conditioner factory established by Japan's
Sharp Corp. Officials predict that by 1995 the new area's skyline will
boast 100 high-rise buildings, including a financial center that will
house the country's main stock exchange, commodities exchanges and
currency trading operations.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's comeback is emerging as a key test of China's ability to
shed its communist fetters and create a modern market economy. The
city of 13 million, China's largest, encompasses nearly all of the
nation's most troublesome economic problems -- poor transportation and
distribution systems, inefficient state enterprises, poorly defined
property rights and imperious bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leadership under Deng Xiaoping, aware that a successful
renaissance in Shanghai would send the strongest possible signal of
the nation's advancement, is treating the city as an important
showcase of economic reform, a major change from the 1980s, when
Shanghai was held in check.
</P>
<P>
Tax laws have been changed to entice foreign-funded ventures, and
$17 billion worth of infrastructure projects is nearing completion,
including power generation plants, waste water treatment facilities
and a two bridges over the Huangpu River, connecting the city's
western and eastern segments for the first time. A second group of
projects is now underway, including a new airport, subway, ring road
and ocean container terminal.
</P>
<P>
Seldom, if ever, has so bold a venture in urban renewal been
launched in a city where history echoes so clamorously.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai attained its international fame as the result of some
particularly shameful excesses on the part of Western imperial
powers.In the 1840s, colonists from Britain, France and the United
States -- including many opium traders -- carved out sections of the
city exempt from Chinese law, with exclusive parks and gentlemen's
clubs.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of international banks and trading houses set up shop in
Shanghai. European refugees fleeing Bolshevism and Nazism flooded in
by the tens of thousands during the era between the two world wars, as
did Chinese refugees fleeing civil strife and the Japanese invasion.
</P>
<P>
While Shanghai's high society thronged to cabarets, tea dances and
greyhound races, its vast underclass endured slave labor, opium
addiction and starvation.
</P>
<P>
The communists rid the city of its most sordid blight, and Shanghai
became a bastion of ultra-leftist zealotry during Mao's reign. But now
the Maoist legacy weighs heavily on the city.
</P>
<P>
Years of neglect left an infrastructure designed for a population a
fraction of Shanghai's size.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 3 million Shanghainese work for state-owned enterprises,
many of them money-losing dinosaurs, and the authorities dare not
allow the extensive layoffs that would enhance efficiency. Foreigners
complain that bureaucrats, eager to fill municipal coffers, are
demanding absurdly high amounts for property leases, a development
that is threatening to cool investors' enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
Yet Shanghai's development goals, which once evoked widespread
skepticism, are no longer the object of derision.
</P>
<P>
``Three years ago, I would have been rather reserved,'' said Annick
de Kermadec-Bentzmann, manager of the Shanghai office of the Banque
Nationale de Paris. ``Today, when you look at what's going on, you
have to admit, it's quite surprising. It's not just a fantasy.''

 ANALYSIS: `Where To Now?' Israelis Ask (Jerusalem) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In leaving the Gaza Strip after a quarter-century of
military occupation and looking toward withdrawal from the West Bank,
Israel is finally able in the view of many of its liberal thinkers to
return to the question, profound and contentious, of what kind of
nation it should be.
</P>
<P>
``As long as we were occupying another people, depriving the
Palestinians by force of arms of their basic human and political
rights, we were not a democratic state ourselves. And as long as we
had more than 2 million Palestinians under us, we were on the way to
losing our Jewish identity,'' philosopher Yeshayahu Leibowitz
declared.
</P>
<P>
``We can again ask ourselves the question, What does it mean for
Israel to be Jewish? What kind of democracy should we have? What sort
of nation are we? What sort of people should we aspire to be? After a
generation, those questions are back at the top of the agenda.''
</P>
<P>
Although the iconoclastic Leibowitz challenged Israel's occupation
of the West Bank and Gaza Strip immediately after the 1967 Middle East
War, and called for a Palestinian state, he is joined today by many
others closer to the Israeli political center in suggesting that the
country must now confront new issues.
</P>
<P>
``The glue of security has kept this country together,'' said Rabbi
Naama Kelman, who directs Reform Judaism's education program here.
``If we obtain peace with the Palestinians and then with the other
Arab neighbors as we hope -- and that is a big if -- we will face
serious questions like social unrest, poverty, domestic violence,
intolerance, economic priorities and relations between synagogue and
state....
</P>
<P>
``Once Israelis are less concerned about physical security, they
will have time to worry about spiritual security -- and they will find
there is a lot to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
Among Israeli liberals, there already is a lengthening agenda: the
role of religion in the Jewish state, improvement of education after
years of degradation, relations between Jews and Arabs within Israel,
how to close social gaps while encouraging entrepreneurs, the future
of Judaism itself.
</P>
<P>
Many on the Israeli right share these concerns. But their focus,
more than ever, is on security, because of their fear that an
agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organization on Palestinian
self-government will prove to be a death trap for the country.
</P>
<P>
Even liberals preface their discussions of where the country should
go with clearly stated assumptions that the autonomy deal must be the
first step into an era of peace -- and with warnings that, if it fails,
Israelis will respond ``very, very vigorously and violently,'' as
Rabbi David Hartman put it, and then retreat back into the ``world of
conflict'' that they know so well.
</P>
<P>
Novelist Amos Oz, while noting that ``everything depends on the
Arabs and their acceptance of us,'' said it ``already feels a bit
strange -- this life `after the (occupied) territories' and the
possibility we will look out and not see someone ready to kill us.
</P>
<P>
``I worry sometimes that Israel at peace will lose its character
and become part of a homogenized, CNN world. That would be a great
pity, because Jews form a unique instrument in the world orchestra of
art and culture, and it would be a shame if it vanished.''
</P>
<P>
``The big question is whether Israel is the end of Jewish history
or another chapter of Jewish history,'' asserted Hartman, a theologian
and philosopher. ``People are wondering seriously about that. There is
a profound Jewish identity crisis in Israel.''
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
With the establishment of Israel as a modern state in 1948 -- and
earlier, in the Zionist movement -- according to Hartman, Leibowitz and
others, many Jews came to substitute the founding and building of a
national home for the spiritual values and way of life that had
defined Judaism for centuries.
</P>
<P>
Israel's triumph in the 1967 war, including the conquest of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, confirmed for many that ``the whole biblical
promise was being worked out ... and we were living in God's
redemptive scheme,'' Hartman said. ``That meant they need not ask any
difficult or embarrassing questions about the future of the Jewish
people or the purpose of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
That was an illusion on virtually a national scale, Hartman and
others maintain. And because of the fundamental shifts implicit in
recognizing the Palestinians' right to self-determination, including a
share of the biblical Land of Israel, Israelis will soon be searching
for new points of orientation.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Michael Breeson, who writes provocatively on political and social
issues under the name ``B. Michael'' in Israel's largest newspaper,
Yediot Aharonot, was even more pungent in assessing this historic
juncture.
</P>
<P>
``Over our 27 years in the Gaza Strip and on the West Bank, we
became occupation junkies, hooked on power and running -- and ruining -- 
other people's lives,'' Breeson said, ``and now we have to give it up.
That will be tough. People know they have to kick the habit -- and that
means getting out entirely from the West Bank, settlements and all -- 
but they say, `Just a little more.' ''
</P>
<P>
For secular Jews such as Ilana Hammerman, a prominent editor, the
questions may be the same as they are for Leibowitz, Hartman and
others who are religious, but the answers are certain to be different.
</P>
<P>
``Is Israel a religious state, a theocracy run by rabbis, or is it
democratic and pluralist?'' Hammerman asked. ``We need a very big
discussion on that. Having our lives run by rabbis, as it is now at
the most important points like birth, marriage and death, is the first
battle I will fight.
</P>
<P>
``Then there is education -- that is the very future of our society.
Next is the forced nationalism, the militarism and all the holy little
rituals that remind me of countries we fled. What about the cultural
conflicts we have among us? I could go on -- the list is long. But when
can we start? If we have to wait another 40 years, we will cease to
exist.''
</P>
<P>
Oz also believes that ``the future has already begun -- getting out
of Gaza just confirmed it.''
</P>
<P>
``Turn your back on Jerusalem and scan the entire coastal plain
from Haifa down to Ashdod, and you see a land that is secular to the
core, hedonistic, passionate, noisy, warmhearted, temperamental like
Greece, Italy, Spain and North Africa,'' Oz said.
</P>
<P>
``Israel is finding its place in the Mediterranean where it
belongs. I like it. People smoke a lot, speak loudly, push a lot, but
are open and creative, very creative. What makes me relatively
optimistic is that it is not going to become a boring place for a very
long time.''

 Los Angeles Gangs Now Raiding Vegas Casinos for Cash (Las Vegas) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LAS VEGAS, Nev.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like corporate raiders seeking new markets to
exploit, Los Angeles gang members have come gunning for easy money on
the high-rolling Strip.
</P>
<P>
In a spree of brazen invasion-style heists -- three of them in the
last three months -- suspected Bloods and Crips have stormed into
casinos, rifled through the cashier's cages and made off with tens of
thousands of dollars in a matter of seconds.
</P>
<P>
No bystanders have been injured in any of the attacks, which
reflect the continuing evolution of some South-Central Los Angeles
gangs into profit-driven enterprises. But the robberies, captured on
dramatic surveillance videotape, have stunned this mushrooming tourist
mecca and forced image-conscious proprietors to begin beefing up their
intentionally low-key security measures.
</P>
<P>
``When you see these guys jumping like animals over the counters
with their pillow cases ready to fill with bounty, that really strikes
fear in people's hearts,'' said Beecher Avants, security chief at the
Gold Coast and a candidate for Clark County sheriff. ``This is going
to continue ... as long as we leave cash laying out there like
candy.''
</P>
<P>
Starting with a November 1992, robbery at the San Remo Hotel and
Casino, there have been seven casino heists in Las Vegas, including
holdups at the Aladdin, Flamingo Hilton, Harrah's and the San Remo
again. Although Los Angeles gangs are suspects in five of the
assaults, authorities have had enough evidence to file charges in only
two.
</P>
<P>
In almost every case, at least three or four masked gunmen have
burst into the neon-bathed gambling halls, waving shotguns and
shouting for everyone to hit the floor. A few times, the crowds failed
to even hear the commands, drowned out by the clatter of slot machines
and the unshakable lounge bands.
</P>
<P>
Vaulting over the belly-high counters of the cashier's cages, the
robbers have scooped up bundles of large bills, then sped away in
stolen cars. One group of alleged thieves, all suspected Crips, was
caught in Las Vegas after a high-speed chase. The 15-year-old
triggerman in another casino robbery was arrested in South-Central Los
Angeles after an informant overheard him boasting about his feat.
</P>
<P>
None of the loot, which has ranged from $47,000 to $158,000, has
been recovered.
</P>
<P>
``It's like they think we're the new frontier, that we're easy
pickin's,'' said deputy district attorney Victoria Villegas, who
successfully urged a 30-year prison term for the juvenile shooter.
``We're trying to send a message to L.A. gangs that this not going to
be looked upon lightly.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
For much of the last decade, Crips and Bloods have been evolving
from turf-oriented neighborhood cliques into business-minded outfits.
Some of the more sophisticated factions have helped fuel a nationwide
drug-trafficking network, while others have been linked to the
alarming rise in Southern California bank robberies.
</P>
<P>
``Our gangbangers are master opportunists,'' said Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Sgt. Wes McBride, who fields calls from law
enforcement agencies around the country seeking information about
Crips and Bloods migrating from Los Angeles. ``Like any predator, they
take what they can get.''
</P>
<P>
With the crack cocaine market saturated and banks rapidly
bolstering security, gang experts say, the fast cash of Las Vegas
became a lucrative target. Not only are many of the cashier's cages
wide open, but there is little chance that a security guard would risk
firing a gun in a casino crowded with tourists.
</P>
<P>
``No matter what gets taken in a robbery, it's not as much as
they'd have to pay if grandma gets shot at the damn slot machine,''
said Jim Galipeau, a deputy probation officer in South-Central Los
Angeles. ``It's well-known in the gang community that you can go in
and take anything you want from a Vegas casino as long as you can get
out the door.''

 Anti-Yeltsin Leader Re-Establishes Himself in Politics (Moscow) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
His hair has grown grayer and his face grimmer, but
Alexander Rutskoi still looks and sounds much as he did last Oct. 3
when he stood on a balcony of the Russian White House and exhorted a
roiling mob of armed supporters to topple President Boris N. Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
The trademark mustache is still in place under narrow blue eyes
that flick back and forth in humorless scrutiny. And the bitter
denunciations of Yeltsin and his ``regime of national betrayal'' still
fall from his lips like verbal hand grenades.
</P>
<P>
``This regime is a Fifth Column inside Russia,'' Rutskoi told a
conference of government opponents Saturday. ``It is fulfilling the
assignments of the international monetary groups that are reaching for
our natural resources. This is a Mafia clan that is running the
country.''
</P>
<P>
The conference was a kind of political coming-out party for
Rutskoi, the former fighter jock and defrocked vice president who
spent four months in prison after breaking with Yeltsin and leading
the revolt that ended in a bloody tank assault on the White House last
fall.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the gathering was to relaunch Rutskoi as a serious
political figure by making him the rallying point of a new coalition
of neo-communists, ultranationalists and other Yeltsin opponents
called Accord in the Name of Russia.
</P>
<P>
Only three months ago, when Rutskoi and the other leaders of the
October revolt walked out of prison to supporters' chants of
``Rutskoi, president!'' events appeared to be moving in their
direction. Russia's chronic political and economic instability seemed
to be undermining Yeltsin's support and paralyzing his will to act,
creating an ominous power vacuum made to order for his most implacable
opponents.
</P>
<P>
But since then Yeltsin has fought back, moving in a variety of ways
to reassert himself as a leader, shore up his own support and divide
the ranks of his adversaries. As a result, many observers believe, the
first frail shoots of political stability are sprouting in Russia -- 
and hard-liners like Rutskoi and his allies have been pushed to the
fringe, at least for the moment.
</P>
<P>
``It is a kind of stabilization -- very temporary, very fragile -- 
but nonetheless stabilization,'' says Viktor Kremenyuk, a Moscow
political analyst who is no great fan of Yeltsin's. ``It gives the
government some breathing room.''
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
One source of this new stability is economic. While Russia's
economy remains in steep decline, its most acute problem -- runaway
inflation -- has eased considerably recently, dropping from 22 percent
in January to 9.7 percent last month. With inflation easing, Yeltsin
moved last week to brake the drop in production by cutting taxes and
ending government controls on exports.
</P>
<P>
A second source is Yeltsin's recent burst of activity. Russia's
political center of gravity has shifted rightward in recent months and
the president has moved with it, dropping radical reformers from his
Cabinet and projecting an image of toughness against crime, corruption
and those who would take advantage of Russia's troubles. While this
shift has worried some foreign leaders, it apparently has helped
Yeltsin recapture the support of some of the millions of voters who
unexpectedly cast ballots for ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky in
the December parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
``These people want a strong executive figure,'' says Boris
Mikhailov, director of domestic political studies at the U.S.-Canada
Institute, a Moscow think tank. ``Their vote for Zhirinovsky was a
kind of protest vote, not just about economic instability but also
social instability. I think most of them are moving back toward the
president as he becomes tougher on the law-and-order issue.''
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has also moved to split his opposition by offering a kind
of political non-aggression pact called a treaty on civic accord.
While the agreement was derided by some as hollow and meaningless, it
was signed by a surprisingly wide array of politicians, including
Zhirinovsky and parliamentary chairman Ivan Rybkin. Since then, Rybkin
has steered his chamber in a more cooperative direction, despite his
communist background.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin believes that the treaty has succeeded in isolating those
adversaries, such as Rutskoi and Communist Party leader Gennady
Zyuganov, who refused to sign it. ``The forces of the irreconcilable
opposition ... are increasingly becoming a side, marginal phenomenon
in Russian politics,'' says Yeltsin's chief spokesman, Vyacheslav
Kostikov.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
An air of lethargy and frustration hung over Saturday's gathering
of hard-liners, which attracted about 300 people, most of them aging
Communists. Several leaders expected to attend, such as Agrarian Party
chief Mikhail Lapshin and jurist Valeri Zorkin, failed to show.
Rutskoi complained openly about Yeltsin's success in stealing the
opposition's issues.
</P>
<P>
After a morning of mostly dull speechifying and a closed-door
strategy session in the afternoon, the delegates voted to adjourn
until fall, when they hope the political situation will be more
favorable to them.

 Houston Crime Rate Plummets in Wake of Additional Police (Houston) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
HOUSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
These days, Mayor Bob Lanier sits comfortably in his City
Hall office, his black Western-style boots plopped on his desk and a
stack of charts and graphs in his lap. He likes to talk statistics; he
revels in numbers, and he can spin off facts about Houston as fast as
a Texas tornado.
</P>
<P>
But there is one statistic he cherishes most: The city's overall
crime rate has plummeted more than 30 percent since he was elected
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
Lanier credits the sharp decline not to ``new-fangled ideas'' such
as community-based policing but to hundreds of newly hired police
officers whose sole purpose is to go out in uniform every day and make
arrests.
</P>
<P>
``I don't look on police officers as social workers,'' he said,
espousing ideas that run counter to what other big cities, such as Los
Angeles, are trying to do.
</P>
<P>
``I don't expect a police officer to go to a neighborhood and
figure out a drainage problem or a ditch problem. I expect him to do
police work.''
</P>
<P>
Down the street at police headquarters, Police Chief Sam Nuchia is
equally plain-spoken. ``When I took over,'' he said, ``we quit using
the terminology `neighborhood-oriented policing.' Instead, I declared
that we were going to make it as tough on the criminals as we possibly
could.''
</P>
<P>
Just a few years ago, before Lanier and Nuchia moved into their
jobs, Houston was considered a model for community policing -- a
concept that has caught on in other big cities looking to rebuild
public trust in their police departments.
</P>
<P>
While Los Angeles is only slowly implementing the program as a
result of the 1991 beating of black motorist Rodney King by white
police officers, Houston officials claim to have learned the hard way
that the effort never really paid off.
</P>
<P>
The perception here is that instead of reducing crime, community
policing fueled a deep resentment among officers, did little to boost
the public's trust of the police and ultimately cost the two biggest
champions of the policy -- the police chief and the mayor -- their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Houston never had an episode as divisive in police-community
relations as the King case. But there were past controversies
nevertheless. A Latino man drowned after he was handcuffed by police
and forced to swim in the bayou. A ``throw-down'' weapon was planted
on a suspect after he was shot by police.
</P>
<P>
To turn the tide, Houston in 1982 brought in its first outside
police chief, who also happened to be its first minority chief, just
as Los Angeles did in hiring Willie L. Williams from Philadelphia in
1992.
</P>
<P>
Lee P. Brown, who served as Houston's chief until 1990, made
neighborhood-oriented policing a hallmark of his administration.
</P>
<P>
It was designed to make police officers more aware of community
concerns, to get them out of the patrol cars and into neighborhood
meetings and other civic ventures. Proponents say it works best when
officers walk their beats, meet residents and business owners and
enlist the public in crime-prevention efforts.
</P>
<P>
Brown was followed by Chief Elizabeth Watson, a 20-year veteran who
stayed until 1992. She embraced many of Brown's programs, but her
tenure was troubled.
</P>
<P>
Because of the oil bust in eastern Texas and the subsequent
economic downturn here, the city under then-Mayor Kathryn J. Whitmire
put a freeze on the hiring of officers, closed the police academy and
did not grant police pay raises.
</P>
<P>
The police, in turn, began ridiculing neighborhood-oriented
policing, saying that its initials actually stood for ``Nobody On
Patrol.'' Morale sunk and senior officers began leaving for other
cities where old-fashioned police work was still practiced. When
Whitmire lost to Lanier in the fall of 1991, police officers unfurled
a banner downtown proclaiming: ``Ding, Dong. The Witch Is Dead.''
</P>
<P>
``The previous administration was penny-wise and pound-foolish,''
Nuchia said. ``They saved money on the budget, but they also allowed
the strength of the department to go down at a time when we needed it
most.''
</P>
<P>
Lanier, a wealthy businessman, ran for mayor on a promise to beef
up the police ranks. ``That was the only campaign issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He was elected in November 1991, and one of his first appointments
was Nuchia, then an assistant U.S. attorney who earlier had worked as
a junior police administrator in Houston. Almost immediately they
froze their predecessors' plans to expand community policing, such as
putting officers in ``storefront'' substations around the city where
they would be more accessible to residents.
</P>
<P>
Lanier, in order to reopen the police academy and start hiring
officers, scuttled a proposed downtown monorail system and saved $50
million. ``That was a goddamn Tinkertoy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he picked up another $50 million by restructuring the
city's debt and saved $50 million more by improving its
revenue-collection system.
</P>
<P>
So far, the department has grown from 3,900 sworn officers to
4,800. Now Lanier is seeking a four-cent sales tax to boost the force
to 5,200 officers.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to today, murder and rape each dropped 15 percent,
according to police department statistics. Robbery was down 22.5
percent; theft down 25 percent; burglary down 41.2 percent; and auto
theft down 42.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Even with aggravated assaults up 12.5 percent (the only category to
see a rise), the total crime rate dropped 30.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
In addition, police response times to crime scenes shortened, from
6.1 minutes on major calls to 4.4 minutes. Police morale, meantime,
went up, particularly when Lanier and Nuchia found two small pay
raises for officers.
</P>
<P>
The chief and the mayor suggested that Los Angeles, which appears
to be going the opposite direction, also might be better served by
increasing its police force before embarking on new community
programs.
</P>
<P>
``I don't want to tell them their business,'' Lanier said, ``but I
think they have a big problem. They don't have enough police. That's
going to strain any additional duties. It's going to strain things.''

 Controversy Flares Over Control of Nazi Files (Berlin) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 100 times a minute, 50,000 times a day, a camera
shutter clicks in a windowless basement in southwest Berlin, capturing
on each frame a fragment of Germany's grim past.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen camera operators labor throughout the day on what some
here say may be the most ambitious microfilming project ever
undertaken: the duplication of 75 million pages of Nazi personnel
documents stored in a former Gestapo eavesdropping post now known as
the Berlin Document Center.
</P>
<P>
The microfilmers work swiftly because on July 1 the U.S. State
Department intends to relinquish custody of the original documents to
the German government. The duplicates -- 8 million feet of film on
38,000 rolls -- will be flown to Washington this summer and deposited
in the National Archives. The Justice Department keeps the right to
unrestricted access to the original files.
</P>
<P>
The pages passing beneath the camera lens range from the prosaic to
the sinister: Heinrich Himmler's expense accounts; Nazi Party
membership card No. 899,895, belonging to one Adolf Eichmann; Josef
Mengele's dental records and membership sheet in the Nazi Physicians
Professional Association; Hermann Goering's suicide notes, scribbled
before he swallowed cyanide in 1946.
</P>
<P>
Among the old files with contemporary relevance is that of Erich
Priebke, a former SS captain now awaiting extradition in Argentina on
charges of helping to murder 335 Italians in Rome's Adreatine Caves in
1944.
</P>
<P>
Returning the original documents to German custody is another
milestone in the restoration of German sovereignty after a
half-century of Allied occupation. But the proposed transfer has met
resistance. Historians, Jewish groups and Nazi hunters have bitterly
objected to the State Department's plan. They complain that
restrictive German privacy laws will hamper access to the original
documents, that the National Archives duplicates will not be available
for at least two years and that surrendering the files is morally
wrong.
</P>
<P>
``We bought those documents with the most precious commodity we
have: the blood of our young boys and the other Allied forces that had
to fight the Nazi menace in order to liberate the world,'' Elan
Steinberg, executive director of the World Jewish Congress, said in a
telephone interview from New York. ``I'm reminded of the old saying
that if it ain't broke, don't fix it,'' he said. ``The Berlin Document
Center ain't broke right now, and I don't know why we're trying to fix
it.''
</P>
<P>
Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., who led hearings on the document center
last month, has threatened a full debate in Congress ``on Germany's
Nazi past'' unless Bonn and the State Department resolve the
controversy.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
recently promised Jewish leaders that rules governing access to the
original documents will remain in line with U.S. regulations until the
National Archives duplicates are ready for viewing. U.S. Embassy
officials in Bonn are trying to hammer out the details.
</P>
<P>
``This is something that has been negotiated over quite a long
period of time and has been reviewed from every angle that I can
imagine. When concerns have been raised, they've been reviewed
again,'' said Dan Hamilton, policy adviser to Richard Holbrooke, the
U.S. ambassador to Germany.
</P>
<P>
Donald Kobletz, the State Department's lawyer in Berlin in the
1980s and now a private attorney here, said: ``Can you tell a
sovereign government, one of your closest allies, that 50 years after
the war you don't really trust them to keep their own records? After
getting microfilm copies, paid for by the German government? I would
consider it a gratuitous irritation to our relationship that really
isn't warranted.''
</P>
<P>
Many of the files were seized by Allied troops driving across
Germany -- such as some 10.7 million Nazi Party membership cards
impounded by American soldiers at a Bavarian paper mill as the SS
prepared to reduce them to pulp. The cards provided useful evidence
for prosecutors at the Nazi War Crimes tribunal in Nuremburg.
</P>
<P>
Ever since, the archives have proved invaluable for historians
scrutinizing the Third Reich, for German officials sorting out
immigration requests and for Nazi-hunters looking for culprits. Last
year the center processed 27,000 requests for information from
official agencies and 1,300 from private individuals such as scholars
and journalists.
</P>
<P>
Although few files in this collection contain direct documentation
of mass murder, the information often helps corroborate other
evidence. ``When a guy writes in his resume, `I was assigned to KZ
(concentration camp) Auschwitz,' and he signs it, it's difficult for
him to later claim that he wasn't there,'' said David Marwell, 42, the
center's director.
</P>
<P>
As early as 1952, U.S. officials began discussing the eventual
return of the archives to German control. Many other documents, such
as papers from the Third Reich foreign ministry, were given to the
Germans decades ago after being microfilmed for the National Archives'
Captured German Documents division.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations over the Berlin Document Center were abandoned in the
late 1960s, however, because of U.S. government concerns that
Germany's proposed rules of access ``were unacceptably restrictive of
private scholarly access,'' Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Mary
Ann Peters told Lantos' hearing last month.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, German officials for years privately hinted that they
were content to have such sensitive material remain in American hands.
``I don't think the Germans really wanted the documents,'' said
Kobletz, the former State Department lawyer. ``... It's a bit of a hot
potato for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
The potato got hotter in the 1980s when it was discovered that an
estimated 10,000 pages had been stolen from the archives and sold to
memorabilia collectors willing to pay up to $3,000 for each signature
of a high-ranking Nazi. Marwell was dispatched to Berlin to overhaul
security procedures.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, the German parliament voted unanimously to ask that the
center be remanded to German custody. The microfilming project, which
had begun in 1968 only to stop in 1972, resumed. Last October, the
State Department signed an agreement to relinquish the archive on July
1.
</P>
<P>
In bulk alone the collection is staggering, covering roughly eight
miles of stacked paper. Among the party membership cards is that of
Oskar Schindler -- party No. 6,421,477 -- and Amon Goeth, No. 510,964,
the sadistic commandant of Plaszow concentration camp in Poland; both
men were portrayed in the recent film ``Schindler's List.''
</P>
<P>
Much of the current controversy was stirred by a magazine article
in the New Yorker by writer Gerald Posner, who questioned both the
quality of the microfilming and the potential pitfalls in German
privacy laws. The article contends, for example, that microfilm fails
to distinguish between different colored inks used on some documents
and renders some writing less legible.
</P>
<P>
More significant perhaps are concerns about whether German
archivists would hinder legitimate scholarship. German privacy law
typically prohibits access to files on people until they have been
dead for at least 30 years.
</P>
<P>
However, as to the issue of accessing the original documents,
Marwell expressed confidence that the German government will prove to
be a fair administrator. Since 1988, Germany's Federal Archives has
had the authority to screen requests from German citizens for entry
into the Berlin Document Center; German officials contend that only
one request from a scholar and less than 1 percent of requests from
private citizens have been denied. Moreover, under the agreement
signed last October, the Justice Department keeps the right to
unrestricted access to the files.
</P>
<P>
``For the kind of access that people are concerned about -- 
scholarship and Nazi war crime investigations -- people won't see a
difference,'' Marwell said. ``Absent some dramatic change, I don't
think scholars have anything to worry about.''

With 18 candidates in the race, the absolute majority needed to
declare victory today was out of reach. The runoff would be June 19.
</P>
<P>
According to the partial results from the National Elections
Office, an ex-guerrilla named Antonio Navarro was in third place with
3.9 percent of the vote and self-proclaimed witch Regina Betancur was
fourth with 1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The campaign and balloting took place in relative calm, a marked
contrast to presidential elections four years ago when drug cartel
hitmen and paramilitary squads assassinated three candidates.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, the candidates were forced to adopt a bunker lifestyle and
limit their public appearances to radio and television. This year the
contenders campaigned openly, accompanied by salsa bands and vendors
selling liquor.
</P>
<P>
A turnout of about half of the 17 million eligible voters was
widely predicted. Colombia has coaxed left-wing guerrilla movements
into electoral politics and adopted constitutional changes to
encourage a wider spectrum of participation. But this election seemed
to confirm Colombia's status as essentially a two-party state.
</P>
<P>
Samper has promised to create 1.5 million new jobs, increase social
spending and carry out an economic opening program ``with a human
face.'' A balding economist and lawyer with a nasal voice, Samper
seemed less fit for campaigning on television than Pastrana, but his
performance in two TV debates drew wider praise.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana, 39, an ex-mayor of Bogota, favors free markets,
privatization, minimal government intervention in the economy and an
aggressive campaign to provide more education. The handsome son of a
former president, Pastrana began his public career as the anchor of
his family's TV news program. He speaks flawless English and spent a
year studying at Harvard. During a news conference Saturday, Samper
said he and the other major contenders, as victims of violence, share
``a tragic common denominator.''
</P>
<P>
Samper was hit by 11 bullets, four of which remain in his body, in
an assassination attempt attributed to drug traffickers at the Bogota
airport in 1989. The Medellin cocaine cartel kidnapped Pastrana when
he was a mayoral candidate in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Two other candidates -- Gen. Miguel Maza, a former secret police
chief, and Enrique Parejo, an ex-justice minister -- were attacked
after challenging drug lord Pablo Escobar. The nonviolence of this
year's campaign is widely attributed to Escobar having been killed
last December by security forces.
</P>
<P>
The candidate running third in the polls, Antonio Navarro, is a
former commander of the M-19 rebel group, which laid down its weapons
four years ago in exchange for amnesty. In 1985, Navarro lost a leg
when assailants threw a grenade at him as he ate breakfast in a
restaurant in the southwestern city of Cali.
</P>
<P>
Navarro became a co-president of an assembly that rewrote
Colombia's constitution and, later, President Cesar Gaviria's minister
of health.
</P>
<P>
Both frontrunners say they are willing to negotiate peace with the
insurgents who, together with drug traffickers, right-wing
paramilitary squads and common criminals, have bloodied Colombia.
</P>
<P>
About 28,000 homicides are committed each year, compared with
24,000 in the United States, which has a population eight times as
large.

 Former Communists Victorious in Hungarian Elections (Budapest) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hungary's former communists scored a decisive victory
Sunday in the runoff round of parliamentary elections, winning an
absolute majority of 209 seats in the 386-member legislature.
</P>
<P>
The ex-communists -- now called the Hungarian Socialist Party -- were
trounced in Hungary's first post-Cold War election four years ago but
have been steadily building public support ever since as the promise
of democratic capitalism has soured here.
</P>
<P>
The Socialists -- who have traded their red star symbol for a red
carnation -- won more than 54 percent of the vote nationwide, while the
center-left Alliance of Free Democrats finished second with about 18
percent and 70 seats in parliament. The current ruling party, the
center-right Democratic Forum, finished a distant third with just
under 10 percent of the vote and 37 seats -- nearly 130 fewer than they
won four years ago.
</P>
<P>
To the surprise of most foreign observers, more Hungarian voters
went to the polls in the two rounds of voting -- nearly 70 percent in
the initial round May 8 and 55 percent Sunday -- than did to end 45
years of communist rule in 1990. ``This is the first time in its
history that Hungary has freely voted in a leftist government,'' said
Hungarian political analyst Tibor Vidos.
</P>
<P>
But it also reinforced a recent trend among other East European
countries that replaced communism with nationalist politics and
free-market economics and have since lurched back to the left.
Lithuania led the way, then Poland -- the cradle of anti-communist
insurgency -- and now Hungary too has followed suit, all largely as a
result of widespread economic insecurity, rising unemployment and
social disillusionment brought on by the transition from a communist
welfare state to the hazards of free-market democracy.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian Socialists have pledged there will be no going back
to the authoritarian ways of the old postwar regime and say they
intend to improve on the free-market reforms of the current
government, many of which they say they initiated in the waning days
of communist rule five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Their immediate task will be to decide whether to form a government
on their own or try to find a coalition partner, which many Socialist
leaders favor as a means of widening their political base and
providing additional strength in parliament should it prove necessary
to force through unpopular measures.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Sunday night, Socialist leader Gyula Horn said
his party favors ``broad national cooperation'' and is ready to
cooperate with the second-place Free Democrats, whom he called ``our
natural partners.''
</P>
<P>
Political analysts say the country could be headed for a period of
political and economic instability if the Socialists try to form a
single-party government and that much will depend on whether the Free
Democrats agree to join the Socialists -- a prospect that they say
could require hard and lengthy bargaining even though the parties'
economic platforms are similar.
</P>
<P>
At a separate news conference, Free Democratic leader Gabor Kuncze
said the size of the Socialist victory makes his party's decision on
entering a coalition ``much more difficult,'' since the Socialists'
absolute majority would allow them to carry through programs in
parliament that the Free Democrats might oppose. In early discussions,
the Free Democrats had strongly objected to Horn's becoming prime
minister and had proposed Kuncze instead as the price of their
participation.
</P>
<P>
Kuncze and his party are expected to announce their decision Sunday
after a party convention, just one day after the Socialists meet to
nominate their candidate -- presumably Horn -- as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Horn, who is recovering from a serious auto accident earlier this
month, is a controversial figure here because he served in a
pro-Soviet militia that helped put down the bloody 1956 Hungarian
uprising against communist rule. Free Democrats, among others, have
been asking how Horn can be expected to lead nationwide ceremonies
scheduled for Oct. 23 to mark the 38th anniversary of the revolt.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Gyula's supporters have consistently pointed out
that he was a leader of the communist reform movement here in the
1980s and that as foreign minister he was responsible for opening
Hungary's border with Austria in 1989 so that thousands of East
Germans could flee to the West -- an action they say led ultimately to
the breaching of the Berlin Wall and the Iron Curtain.

 Border States Must Improve Infrastructure, Governments Say (Phoenix) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
PHOENIX
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Border states and cities will have to come up with
innovative ways to finance infrastructure improvements in the region
before they can fully realize the jobs and economic benefits expected
from increased U.S.-Mexico trade.
</P>
<P>
That's the message U.S. government officials brought to last week's
annual Border Governors' Conference here, where leaders from
California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas met with their counterparts
from Mexico's border states to discuss the issues related to approval
of the North American Free Trade Agreement and other regional
concerns.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Mexican governments will not be able to pay for the
roads, bridges, sewers, new border checkpoints and communications
links that must be built to fully leverage NAFTA, Assistant U.S.
Secretary of Commerce Charles F. Meissner said in a speech to the
governors.
</P>
<P>
Meissner said $16 billion in improvements are needed along the
border to facilitate trade, but only $3 billion in U.S. and Mexican
funds are available thus far. ``The public sector cannot meet these
needs. The private sector must help,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Although Congress increased highway and border improvement funding
in 1991 with a view toward increased traffic that would result from
border trade, the funds still run about 35 percent short of what the
states will need to simply maintain current levels of service, said
Bruce Cannon, chief strategic planner for the Federal Highway
Administration.
</P>
<P>
So, states and cities have no choice but to become entrepreneurial
if the infrastructure for the post-NAFTA era is to be built. They may
have to charge a variety of tolls and fees to help finance the
improvements, some speakers suggested. But others warned that charging
excessive fees would only dampen the commercial forces that NAFTA was
designed to unleash.
</P>
<P>
The trade pact was designed to ease trade barriers among Mexico,
the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
Meissner offered the governors his help in setting up a
``consultative'' group of bankers and investment professionals to help
the states draw up business plans and conduct feasibility studies on
border improvements.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Officials said cooperation in planning between U.S. and Mexican
states will be critical to ensure maximum efficiency of dollars spent
and persuading the private sector to invest in improvements.
</P>
<P>
Both Texas and Arizona have set up numerous joint committees with
their Mexican neighbors, bolstering ties that have been in place for
decades.
</P>
<P>
California, by contrast, has been slow in cementing commercial
relations with Baja California, officials from other states said.
Whereas other border governors have made it a priority to develop
closer ties with neighboring Mexican states, most coordinated
activities in California is being carried out between the municipal
governments of San Diego and Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
California's relative lack of statewide coordination may be due to
Gov. Pete Wilson's preoccupation with the state's financial problems
and the fact that up to now the state's massive economy has not had to
put much energy into stimulating trade, some officials noted.

 MARKET BEAT: Global Investing Has Changed 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American investors in European stocks and bonds experienced a bad
case of deja vu last week: European markets plunged on growing fears
that interest rates there have bottomed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, it took an actual boost in short-term rates by
the Federal Reserve Board to send U.S. stocks reeling. In Europe, all
it took last week was for German central bank President Hans Tietmeyer
to suggest that the Bundesbank may be finished cutting short rates for
now.
</P>
<P>
Mindful of Germany's still-languishing economy, Tietmeyer said
nothing about raising rates. Yet investors reacted with horror at the
thought that European short rates might stop falling, after only 20
months of Bundesbank-led cuts. At about 5 percent now, the yield on
three-month German treasury bills is well above the 4.25 percent yield
on U.S. T-bills -- even though Germany's economy is weak while the U.S.
economy is strong.
</P>
<P>
Rattled by Tietmeyer, the Frankfurt stock market's DAX index
slumped 109 points for the week, to 2,141 Friday -- a drop of 4.8
percent, or the equivalent of the Dow industrial index losing 180
points from its current 3,757 1/8.
</P>
<P>
Because the Bundesbank largely calls the tune for interest rates
across Europe, most of the region's other stock markets also went down
hard. In London, the FTSE-100 stock index tumbled 5.1 percent for the
week; Milan's Mibtel index dove 5.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Worse, in some respects, was the reaction in European bond markets
to Tietmeyer's comments. In Britain, the yield on the benchmark
15-year government bond closed at 8½ percent Friday, up from 8 1/8
percent just three days earlier.
</P>
<P>
But while investors were dumping European securities, other world
markets paid scant attention. In fact, North American, South American
and Asian stock markets generally finished higher last week or
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Other markets' ability to ignore Europe's turmoil may be a sign
that international investing has become a stock-picker's game again -- 
unlike last year, when virtually all foreign markets rocketed.
</P>
<P>
As markets go their separate ways, U.S. investors will find
international investing more challenging, but also potentially more
rewarding. If you can recognize bargains among individual markets, or
you're in a foreign mutual fund that has proved its savvy as a global
stock-picker, you should earn above-average returns.
</P>
<P>
So far in 1994, a good defense has been the best offense in foreign
investing. Early this year, the smart money was selling stocks in Hong
Kong, Singapore, Bangkok and other Southeast Asian markets after their
60 percent-plus gains in 1993. Those markets began to dive in January,
and only recently have they shown signs of bottoming.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Japanese stock market has been this year's big
surprise. The Nikkei index has jumped 19.3 percent year-to-date,
fueled by the perception that Japan's economy is bottoming after three
difficult years.
</P>
<P>
Until last week, European stock markets had held the middle ground
between Southeast Asian markets' plunge and Japan's hot streak. Most
European markets were off marginally for the year, though with the
dollar's weakness American investors still were making money there.
</P>
<P>
Does last week's selloff suggest European stocks are poised for a
meltdown? Many international stock fund managers don't think so. For
the most part, fund managers still believe there's room for short- and
long-term European interest rates to fall, because the Continent's
economy is only beginning to emerge from recession.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, in fact, the Bundesbank's Tietmeyer tried to allay
investors' fears by telling a radio interviewer in Germany that ``it
can be taken for granted'' that the Bundesbank will keep cutting money
market rates, even if it makes no additional cuts in its official
discount rate.
</P>
<P>
But European stocks now face other obstacles, fund managers admit.
John Hickling, who runs the Boston-based Fidelity Overseas fund, says
too many European companies are trying to raise money with new stock
offerings. ``There's supply coming from everywhere,'' he warns.
</P>
<P>
Political risk is also high, with German elections looming this
year. Pressure on politicians in Germany (and across Europe) to use
government spending to bring down double-digit unemployment rates may
keep inflation concerns at the forefront, in turn keeping bond yields
artificially steep.
</P>
<P>
Lastly, there's the issue of valuation: Many European markets look
expensive because corporate earnings remain depressed while stocks
have rallied since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, European stock bulls expect their markets to follow
the U.S. script: As the economy improves, the bulls see investors
flocking back to European industrial stocks, which have the most to
gain from an economic turnaround.
</P>
<P>
For example, Hickling's fund has about half its assets in Europe,
mainly in industrial giants such as auto makers Volvo and Peugeot, and
energy/petrochemical leaders such as Elf Aquitaine and Total.
</P>
<P>
Madelynn Matlock, manager of the Bartlett Value International fund
in Cincinnati, has 59 percent of her fund's asset in Europe. She
expects investors to eventually return to such industrial names as
Tampella, a Finnish maker of mining equipment, and to French
construction materials firm Saint Gobain.
</P>
<P>
Jeff Russell, co-manager of the Smith Barney International Equity
fund in New York, argues that European stocks still don't reflect the
future earnings benefit from corporate restructurings still in full
swing there -- a couple years behind the U.S. restructuring binge.
</P>
<P>
His fund, about 45 percent invested in Europe, has targeted stocks
in Italy, Ireland and other countries that depreciated their
currencies 18 months ago. That depreciation made those countries'
exports more competitive, giving their companies a head start in
Europe's recovery, Russell says.
</P>
<P>
But some international stock fund managers contend that the best
place to put new money to work today isn't Europe, but the beaten-down
emerging markets of Asia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Norman Kurland, head of Pioneer International Growth fund in
Boston, is only 35 percent invested in Europe. He finds more allure in
markets such as Mexico, South Korea and Thailand, especially after
their selloffs this year.
</P>
<P>
If you want to bet on global growth, Kurland argues, it makes more
sense to invest now in Asia or Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Expansions in the United States and Europe, he says, will be
magnified in already-booming emerging economies that are major
exporters to the developed world. And emerging markets' stock
valuations are once again reasonable, he says.

 Ex-Farrakhan Aide Shot at Southern California University 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Khallid Abdul Muhammad, a controversial former aide to Nation of
Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, was wounded in a parking lot shooting
Sunday evening at the University of California, Riverside, where
Muhammad had just given a speech, officials said.
</P>
<P>
A Riverside police sergeant said two or three other people were
also wounded, none of them seriously. An Associated Press photographer
said Muhammad was hit in the foot.
</P>
<P>
A crowd surrounded the gunman in the parking lot outside a
university auditorium where Muhammad had spoken, and beat him before
authorities could break up the fight. He is in police custody,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Two people were injured in the parking lot shoving after the
shooting, said university spokesman Jack Chappell.
</P>
<P>
Muhammad, 43, had been suspended from his duties as senior aide to
Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan after a speech in November in
which he called Jews ``the bloodsuckers of the black nation and the
black community.''
</P>
<P>
That speech was denounced by President Clinton and other black and
Jewish leaders, as well as by Farrakhan himself.

 Recasting lede and additional information throughout 
 Former Nation of Islam Spokesman Wounded by Gunman (Riverside) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
RIVERSIDE, Calif
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A black gunman dressed to look like a member of
the Nation of Islam shot and wounded controversial former Nation of
Islam spokesman Khallid Abdul Muhammad here Sunday, on the steps
outside a university auditorium where Muhammad had just spoken.
</P>
<P>
Muhammad, 43, was hit in the left leg by at least one of five or
six shots from a .9 mm handgun, officials said. He was in satisfactory
condition at Riverside Community Hospital, according to a Muhammad
associate who asked not to be named. (Riverside is about 60 miles east
of Los Angeles).
</P>
<P>
Two Nation of Islam bodyguards were also wounded. Caliph Sadig, 33,
of Upland, Calif., was in satisfactory condition with a wound in the
upper right back. Another guard, Varnado Puckett, 34, of Pomona,
Calif., was shot three times. He was in serious condition, undergoing
surgery at Riverside General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
The gunman -- wearing the dark suit, white shirt and bow tie
``characteristic of what his security people were wearing,'' said
University of California, Riverside, spokesman Jack Chappell -- stepped
from a crowd of some 50 people outside the auditorium where Muhammad
had just spoken, and fired from five to 10 feet away.
</P>
<P>
He was severely beaten by the crowd, some of whom reportedly
shouted, ``He works for the Jews.'' (Muhammad was fired as an aide to
Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan after making anti-Semitic
remarks last year.) Police plucked the bloodied man from the angry
crowd and put him in a police car until he could be taken away by
ambulance.
</P>
<P>
Riverside Police Sgt. Robert Hanson said authorities are not
releasing the name of suspect because of concerns for his safety. No
motive for the shooting has been discussed by officials.
</P>
<P>
Ahromuz, a longtime Muhammad friend who was standing on the
auditorium steps next to Muhammad when he was shot, said someone had
just asked him to compare the struggle of Latinos with those of
African Americans.
</P>
<P>
``The last thing I remember him saying was, `The same dog that bit
you, bit me,' '' said Ahromuz.
</P>
<P>
``After that, just pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. It was so close. I just
took my daughter and hit the ground,'' he said. ``I heard a bullet
echo in my ear and I could smell gunpowder.''
</P>
<P>
In the chaos after the 6:09 p.m. shooting, Ahromuz said, several
young African-American men attacked some white people who had rushed
to the scene, but others who had been at the speech intervened.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Fruit of Islam, the Nation of Islam's security
contingent, carried the wounded Muhammad back through the building to
a waiting white Lincoln Continental and hurried him to Riverside
Community Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Associated Press photographer William Lewis said angry supporters
descended on the gunman and pummeled him as police attempted to stop
them.
</P>
<P>
``They were just kicking and stomping him in the head. That's where
the pandemonium was. They dragged the shooter out by the nape of his
neck, blood dripping,'' he said. ``People were still trying to get
their kicks in. The police were trying to protect him. And the people
wouldn't let him get out.''
</P>
<P>
UC Riverside senior Mark Thaler, who attended the speech, saw the
suspect later, ``a bloodied head, and (he was) propped up'' in the
back of the police car.
</P>
<P>
Muhammad's son, 9-year-old Farrakhan Khallid Muhammad, was carried
away by aides as he screamed, ``Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!'' The boy, who
frequently appears on stage with Muhammad, did not appear to be
injured.
</P>
<P>
Under intense security that included pat-downs and bag searches and
a hefty presence of police, campus security as well as Fruit of Islam,
nearly 450 people had entered the Student Recreation Center to hear
Muhammad, who was sponsored by the African Student Alliance at UC
Riverside.
</P>
<P>
During the speech, some 70 protesters picketed silently outside,
among them Jewish and Roman Catholic students.
</P>
<P>
Inside, three people were thrown out of the building after they
began heckling Muhammad. Campus officials identified one of them as
Irv Rubin, a member of the Jewish Defense League.
</P>
<P>
Following the speech, Muhammad stepped outside, where 50 or 60
people were waiting.
</P>
<P>
``After a speech, he likes to deal with the people, which irritates
his security,'' a friend of Muhammad's told the Los Angeles Times.
``Security is more worried about Khallid than Khallid himself.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
That Muhammad arouses strong passions has been evident since his
controversial remarks last November at a New Jersey college about
Jews, comments which got Muhammad fired from his job as senior aide to
Nation of Islam head Louis Farrakhan.
</P>
<P>
Muhammad said that Jews and Arabs were ``the bloodsuckers of the
black nation and the black community,'' and suggested that Jews
brought the Holocaust upon themselves.
</P>
<P>
After his speech was denounced by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the
Congressional black caucus and President Clinton, Farrakhan was forced
to reprimand Muhammad and suspend him from his role as top aide and
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Although Farrakhan said he agreed with Muhammad's remarks, he
disagreed with how he said them.
</P>
<P>
Muhammad, however, said he was told his speech was ``repugnant,
malicious, mean-spirited .... I feel very hurt over those words, to be
honest.''
</P>
<P>
He acknowledges the raw nerves his speeches touch, saying again and
again, ``I'm a truth terrorist, I'm a knowledge gangster.''

 Macedonia: Fuse or Stopper? 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The following editorial appeared in Monday's Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
The United States didn't create the Macedonia problem but by its
sluggish diplomacy lets a fire spread that could yet ignite a second
set of Yugoslav wars, rather than contributing to closing down the
ongoing first set.
</P>
<P>
Washington does this mischief by bending excessively to an
assertive Greek lobby, thereby stiffening Athens in its dispute with
the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, which is now a declared
state.
</P>
<P>
A more independent policy would let Washington help move both sides
toward necessary compromise.
</P>
<P>
The dispute between Athens and what it calls, by the capital's
name, ``Skopje'' arises from Macedonia's grip on a name, flag and
constitution that Greece claims are irredentist.
</P>
<P>
Small and weak Macedonia badly overreached in its choice of
nationalist symbols and rhetoric. Greece is supposedly a mature
country, able to distinguish a short-term political victory from a
long-term strategic debacle. But in response it went off the deep end,
imposing a crushing economic embargo and opening an effective campaign
of political isolation.
</P>
<P>
Throw in multiethnic Macedonia's sharpening internal tensions,and
you have a recipe for pitching the so-far spared southern Balkans into
the northern Balkans' fire.
</P>
<P>
Washington's role is curious. It has put nearly 600 peace-eepers on
Macedonia's northern border as a caution to Serbia. This represents a
policy of stabilizing Macedonia. At the same time, though it
recognizes the ``Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,'' it does not
send an ambassador.
</P>
<P>
This conspicuous default has the effect of destabilizing Macedonia.
How is this awkward contradiction to be explained? The result
corresponds to the appeals of Greece and its friends.
</P>
<P>
A look at Macedonia on a map tells the real story. The country
abuts Serbia, including the inflamed Serb province of Kosovo, on the
north and Albania, Greece and Bulgaria on its other borders.
</P>
<P>
It could be the fuse that, once lit by, say, an explosion in
tightly wound, majority-Albanian Kosovo, could touch off further
explosions through the region. Unlit, however, Macedonia also could be
the stopper. This is the double potential that American diplomacy has
yet to grasp.
</P>
<P>
Greece seems unfamiliar with the requirement to think in a regional
context. The United States is in a position to render Greece a true
friend's service -- to help it to rise above parochial political
concerns and face the urgent requirement for a responsible regional
policy.

 Rebels Faltered in Beijing Because They Were Students 
 With Little Understanding of Compromise 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Beijing in 1989, one of the larger student-democracy movements
in a century emerged. More than 3,000 young students gathered in
Tiananmen Square, gaining the support and concern of people in China
and around the world.
</P>
<P>
Now, almost exactly five years have passed, and during these years,
the world has changed tremendously. The communist ``camp'' has fallen
apart. A new world structure has appeared.
</P>
<P>
If we want to understand why there has been such a huge change in
so brief a time, we should not neglect the China democracy movement of
1989 -- and the response of the Chinese regime.
</P>
<P>
That regime had reacted wrongheadedly many times in countering the
student movement. But never was the government more wrong than on that
June night, when it used bullets and tanks to suppress the students.
Such brutal behavior astonished the world, and I cannot overstate my
condemnation of it.
</P>
<P>
But as a member of the leadership of the movement, I don't want to
use more ink to express my anger. Rather, I want to look back at the
main reasons for the failure of the democratic movement.
</P>
<P>
In June 1989, when students went to the streets, the only motive
they had was to push the process of political reform through orderly,
radical political expression. Their aim was to compel China to become
a democratic, modern society more quickly. This pure motive gained
popular support; it was also the fundamental reason students lost
their lives.
</P>
<P>
As students, we never realized we were engaged in a political
movement. Our goal was just to express our opinions, to try to
represent the people's voice. We wanted the government to answer
questions and come up with some solutions to the country's problems.
Even the most radical students never thought of adopting the tactics
of a general political struggle, such as having contact with the
ruling class, learning about power struggles within it, arousing the
masses or making alliances with other political powers.
</P>
<P>
We thought of ourselves as simply a student movement. This, I
think, was why we had no effective political means to resist
government suppression. Furthermore, if we had treated our movement as
a political movement, we would have accepted some sort of appropriate
compromise. We should have known that political struggle is the art of
compromise.
</P>
<P>
But in reality, the students did not have any desire to pursue
political interests. They merely wanted to express their political
wishes.
</P>
<P>
When the government labeled their action as ``anti-Communist
Party,'' ``anti-Socialist system'' or ``turmoil,'' the students
reacted with strong resistance. At that point, they did not want to
compromise at all. That's how the deadlock formed between the
government and the students.
</P>
<P>
Looking back from today's vantage point, we can see that if the
students had withdrawn from Tiananmen Square of their own accord and
adopted more meaningful measures of political struggle, they would not
have had to pay such a price in lost lives.
</P>
<P>
June 4 had an important impact on Chinese history -- even on world
history. For China, the 1989 democracy movement was an important step
on the road to modernization. More than that, it served as a means to
enlightenment.
</P>
<P>
After several decades of political suppression, the value of
democracy and freedom had little room in the Chinese people's heart.
The 1989 movement opened that heart again. Its larger meaning is
beyond words.
</P>
<P>
For a country to follow a democratic road, it must first meet a
basic precondition: Its citizens must possess a strong desire for
democracy and a civic consciousness. Not only intellectuals but
influential workers' groups must show the social responsibility to
help the larger society reach this precondition.
</P>
<P>
From this point of view, the June 4th movement helped to build a
strong foundation for realization of a politically democratic China.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, however, ordinary Chinese have generally
distanced themselves from politics. This detached attitude is the
inevitable consequence of the bloody suppression of June 4.
</P>
<P>
Some hold the student movement responsible for this aftermath. They
criticize the movement, saying it brought harmful effects to the
process of China's modernization. But these opinions are, in my view,
very shallow. We must clear our eyes and see: The Chinese government
is responsible for what happened.
</P>
<P>
It's normal for people to keep silent when they are facing brute
force. It is not politics but their own government that the Chinese
people have distanced themselves from.
</P>
<P>
Nor would I say that people are detached from politics so much as
disappointed. Yet this situation will not last long, because the '89
movement has already planted the seeds of democracy. As soon as the
spring wind comes, the democracy flowers will bloom splendidly.
</P>
<P>
Everyone who learns history knows that the more time that passes
after an important historical event, the clearer what happened
becomes. The same principle applies to the '89 movement.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government totally denies the historical meaning of the
'89 movement. This attitude has caused enormous dissatisfaction inside
people's hearts. If such dissatisfaction continues, China's political
development will not follow the right track.
</P>
<P>
If we do not have political reform, there will be no big
breakthrough in economic reform. The majority of Chinese have decided
that only by following the road of reform can China reach wealth and
power.
</P>
<P>
I firmly believe that unless the '89 movement is rehabilitated, it
will be impossible for China to transform itself peacefully into a
modern society.
</P>
<P>
Several thousand years of history have told us something: When you
forget old suffering, it revisits you.
 Wang Dan, a dissident leader in China now working as a
 freelance writer, was recently detained and released in
 Beijing. This article was translated from Mandarin by Kun Cody.

1,250 words, by Karol V. Menzie (Sun). With GRILL-RECIPES and
GRILL-TIPS.

   VINTAGE-POINT -- The choice of wines to go with grilled food is a
very personal one. The most important factors are what and how you
grill. The weather, side dishes, seasonings and personal preferences
also play a part in choosing a wine to accompany a grilled meal. 750

fall; Italy, the forgotten front. 1,300 words, by Paul S. Green (Post
special) (k). Moved.

   NORTH-COMMENT -- In fall 1986, Oliver North sought to save a
convicted felon from serving his federal prison sentence; the
beneficiary of North's efforts was no common criminal; he was Jose

<TEXT>
<P>
The transformation was completed on a recent Saturday
afternoon when I found myself standing on the lawn with a cordless
phone in one hand and a Frisbee in the other. I was talking with my
wife about plans for dinner at a restaurant on Melrose Avenue, and I
was flinging the flying disk for our dog. And the thought occurred to
me that I had become California Person.
</P>
<P>
In the six years since we moved to the land of low-fat milk and
organic honey, I have survived drought, water rationing, drip
irrigation, several earthquakes, a riot, rain so heavy houses slid
down hillsides, and trips to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where the
stars go to die.
</P>
<P>
I have stood at the top of Mount Hollywood with a bottle of Evian
water in my fanny pack. My grocery store is at Melrose and Vine. My
dog's vet has valet parking.
</P>
<P>
I know that morning clouds almost never mean rain. I know all the
words to ``I Love L.A.'' I no longer turn and stare when a '56
Thunderbird or a '57 Chevy rolls by. I am used to seeing -- and
politely ignoring -- famous actors when I go shopping. A movie location
shoot is just the cause of a detour, not curiosity. I am used to
seeing major sporting events on TV at breakfast time.
</P>
<P>
I pay 29 cents for a huge sack of crispy fresh cilantro instead of
$2.45 for tiny brown bits in a shrink-wrapped package. I know how to
spell ``Chardonnay,'' and I know not to serve it ice cold. I know that
a tostada is not made by Dodge.
</P>
<P>
I can figure out what time it is in Tokyo. I think all those people
in Washington, D.C., my former home, are self-centered, pompous idiots
who ought to get real jobs. I don't smoke anymore. I go to parties
here where nobody smokes, even outside.
</P>
<P>
I expect flowers to bloom in my garden on Christmas Day. I have
swatted flies in January. I have seen the thermometer top 100 in
January. I love to chuckle over blizzard reports from cities where I
used to live. I no longer own a parka, and I can find only one of my
gloves. Umbrella? It's around here somewhere.
</P>
<P>
I know the difference between a gardener and a lawn guy. I know
nobody has ever rolled a 300 game at the Hollywood Bowl. I view 15 mph
on the freeway as steady progress. I am used to waiting 20 minutes
instead of five for a bus during rush hour.
</P>
<P>
I know City Hall is the building Superman used to jump over on TV.
I have hiked in the state park where helicopters used to land on
``MASH.'' I have been in the Griffith Park cave from which the
Batmobile used to come roaring. I know how to get discount tickets to
Disneyland.
</P>
<P>
My home improvement center is on Sunset Boulevard. I have flown the
redeye. I have seen my wife walk up to the mondoplex refreshment stand
and order banana chips and herb tea.
</P>
<P>
I know the best time of the year to visit Yosemite. I have seen
buffalo roaming free on Catalina Island. I know that Catalina is part
of L.A. County. I know the location of the unmarked road to the best
beach at Big Sur.
</P>
<P>
I know the difference between Cinco de Mayo and Mexican
Independence Day. I know the best parking lot to use for a speedy exit
from Dodger Stadium. I can count on my fingers the number of times I
have eaten red meat this year. I have seen the seismo-cam -- too many
times, thank you.
</P>
<P>
Now I certainly have my doubts that any of this has made me a
better person. But it does mean I have adapted enough to this unique
environment that I have a slightly better chance of surviving here
than I did six years ago.

 Cable's fX Channel Displaces C-SPAN (New York) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When fX, the new cable network from Fox, begins
programming Wednesday, it will be available in 18 million U.S.
households, said to be the largest launch of a cable channel in
history. But fX's gain will be C-SPAN's loss.
</P>
<P>
``Some 1.1 million cable subscribers will lose C-SPAN entirely or
see us part time due to cable systems picking up fX,'' said Brian
Lamb, chairman of C-SPAN, the 15-year-old cable channel that televises
congressional proceedings and other public-affairs events.
</P>
<P>
Lamb blames provisions in the 1992 Cable TV Act for this
development, which he says gave Fox and the other broadcast networks
an unfair advantage in rolling out new cable channels.
</P>
<P>
``This is government meddling in communications of the highest
order,'' Lamb said angrily. ``I have nothing against fX, but the
government has given the broadcast networks a powerful jump-start with
their new cable networks, an advantage that no one else has.''
</P>
<P>
What's more, Lamb complained, the same law earlier led to another
2.5 million subscribers losing all or part of their access to C-SPAN
programming.
</P>
<P>
The Cable TV Act prohibited cable companies from carrying a
broadcast signal without the consent of the station. If a station
wanted to provide the signal for free, cable operators in the
immediate area were obligated to carry it, even if they hadn't done so
in the past -- the so-called ``must-carry'' rule that meant dropping or
cutting back on existing channels.
</P>
<P>
If a station didn't want to give away its signal, it could
negotiate for ``retransmission consent.'' This is the route the
networks took with the stations they own, but most cable operators
balked at paying cash to the broadcasters, so many of them struck
deals instead that guaranteed space for network-owned cable channels
in exchange for the right to continue carrying their over-the-air
programming.
</P>
<P>
ABC quickly brought forth ESPN-2, now available in 14 million
homes; Fox developed fX and NBC will launch America's Talking, an
all-talk channel, on July 4, with an initial reach of more than 10
million homes. (CBS chose not to go forward with a cable enterprise.)
</P>
<P>
fX's weekday lineup will mix reruns of ``Dynasty,'' ``Hart to
Hart,'' ``Fantasy Island,'' ``Wonder Woman,'' ``In Living Color,''
``Batman'' and ``Greatest American Hero'' with seven hours a day of
original programming, ranging from an information show along the lines
of ``Good Morning America,'' to a pet show, an issue-of-the-day show
hosted by Jane Wallace a music video program and a viewer call-in
show.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, dozens of other new cable channels are struggling to
find an outlet in the crowded cable universe. Most cable systems
simply don't have the channel capacity to handle anywhere near the
volume of programming that is being offered. If they decide to take
something new, it often means dropping something else or forcing two
services to share time on one channel.
</P>
<P>
``It's the `law of unintended consequences' run amok,'' said
Lawrence Grossman, president of Horizons Network, a proposed cable
channel that would be a ``cultural C-SPAN,'' offering lectures,
readings and other symposiums featuring authors, scientists and
artists. ``The government has given the broadcast networks a preferred
seat on the bus for their new cable channels, while all the new
independent services have been pushed to the back of the bus.''
</P>
<P>
And with cable companies chafing under new rate cuts ordered by the
Federal Communications Commission, new channels such as Grossman's may
not get a better seat anytime soon. The cable operators say that the
government has severely restricted their ability to generate the
revenue needed to upgrade and expand.
</P>
<P>
``The FCC clearly intended to create incentives for new networks,
but the most recent rules have had the opposite effect,'' Grossman
said. ``They've helped to create a situation that discourages new and
innovative program services.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Horizons Network and Ovation Network, a proposed fine-arts network
whose executives include former National Gallery of Art curator Carter
Brown, recently asked the FCC to look at the impact of its regulations
on smaller networks. Kathleen Waldman, deputy chief of the FCC's cable
services bureau, said that the agency may do so.
</P>
<P>
``We are open to hearing arguments about whether we've provided
adequate incentives to add new programming and maintain investment in
public-interest programming like C-SPAN,'' Waldman said. ``We
obviously didn't intend for the rules to discourage diversity in
programming.''
</P>
<P>
The cable industry also has challenged the constitutionality of the
``must-carry'' rule, arguing that, under the First Amendment, the
government may not dictate the programming that cable operators offer.
A decision by the U.S. Supreme Court is expected soon. If it votes to
overturn the law, C-SPAN could win back some of the channel space it
has lost.
</P>
<P>
Some C-SPAN fans aren't waiting for the government to act, however.
They've mounted local campaigns to protest the replacement of C-SPAN
with fX. ``People are outraged that we are going to go off and they
are going to get reruns of `Dynasty' instead,'' Lamb said.
</P>
<P>
In McAllen, Texas, the announcement that TCI Cablevision planned to
drop C-SPAN in favor of fX prompted citizens to demand a meeting with
the mayor.
</P>
<P>
``I'm getting beat up by my customers, but I don't have a lot of
options,'' said TCI General Manager Neil Hamen. ``We have contract
obligations to take fX, we have to take broadcast signals, we're
channel-locked -- the people in Washington who passed the regulations
are reaping what they've sown.''

 HOUSEHOLD HINTS: Tips for Home and Garden 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AROUND THE HOUSE
</P>
<P>
-- When finished painting, wipe off excess paint from can and lid and
apply vegetable shortening around rims. This provides an airtight seal
but allows easy opening next time.
</P>
<P>
-- Welcome summer. Fill an empty fireplace with houseplants or a
bouquet of baby's breath.
</P>
<P>
-- A flexible, cloth measuring tape will easily measure irregularly
shaped objects for workshop projects.
</P>
<P>
-- Seal small holes in window screens with clear cement glue. The
repair will be almost invisible.
</P>
<P>
-- Store children's outdoor toys in 30-gallon garbage containers.
Label contents on top of each lid and keep container close to the play
area in your yard.
</P>
<P>
-- Update your front door with a fresh coat of paint and new
hardware; the change looks as good as a new door and is much less
expensive.
</P>
<P>
IN THE GARDEN
</P>
<P>
-- Determine the pH level of your soil by purchasing a soil testing
kit or calling your local extension agency. An abundance of mushrooms,
moss or fungi in the lawn is indicative of an imbalance and lime may
need to be applied to the soil.

 Networks Play Intriguing Game of Roulette for Fall (Hollywood) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
HOLLYWOOD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The competitive matchups disclosed by ABC, CBS, NBC and
Fox in their recently announced fall schedules are more intriguing
than usual, from the frontline battle of programs to the long-range
ambitions mapped out in executive suites.
</P>
<P>
For viewers, who will see 30 freshman series in the new prime-time
lineups -- 15 dramas, 13 comedies, one newsmagazine and ``The ABC
Family Movie'' -- several matchups are sure to draw major attention:
</P>
<P>
-- NBC is risking its top new series of this season, ``Frasier,'' by
pulling it from its cozy post-``Seinfeld'' slot on Thursdays and
sending it into head-to-head competition with ABC's ``Roseanne,'' one
of the best and most-established comedies on TV.
</P>
<P>
-- On Sundays, all eyes will be on Fox's newly acquired National
Football League games -- swiped from CBS -- and how their lead-in will
affect the tune-in for this highly watched night of TV, prized by
advertisers and networks.
</P>
<P>
With CBS reeling from a one-two punch by Fox, which also this week
swiped eight of its key stations in a daring raid that brought it 12
new affiliates overall, the thing to watch is whether -- and how -- the
football games begin to have an impact on CBS' audience domination on
Sundays with ``60 Minutes'' and ``Murder, She Wrote,'' both
long-running CBS series that have benefited in the past from the
football lead-in.
</P>
<P>
Fox, now possessing the football games -- and commentators long
associated with it, including John Madden, Pat Summerall and Terry
Bradshaw -- will use the contests to lead in to a new action drama,
``Fortune Hunter,'' and ``The Simpsons,'' which is returning to
Sundays. These shows will be followed by Fox's ``Married ... With
Children'' and a new comedy, ``Wild Oats,'' about a group of
20-somethings.
</P>
<P>
If football loosens CBS' hold on Sundays, ``The Simpsons'' and two
other returning, high-profile series that have registered only
mediocre ratings -- ABC's ``Lois Clark: The New Adventures of
Superman'' and NBC's ``seaQuest DSV'' -- will be in place to make yet
another assault at 8 p.m. on ``Murder, She Wrote.''
</P>
<P>
There are other intriguing matchups in the fall schedule, including
Fox's increasingly popular ``Melrose Place,'' which will be moved to
Mondays, taking on such sitcoms as ``Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,''
``Blossom'' and ``Dave's World,'' as well as ABC's weekly NFL game.
</P>
<P>
``Melrose Place'' could benefit from increased public attention to
Fox as a growing network force, but the odds are that it will still
have a rough time against the Big Three competition, although the
show's hold on young viewers is formidable.
</P>
<P>
A key player in Fox's youth-oriented lineup is producer Aaron
Spelling, who, in the coming season, will have three one-hour series
on the network: ``Beverly Hills, 90210,'' ``Melrose Place'' and its
new spinoff, ``Models Inc.'' The new show, with Linda Gray as the head
of a modeling agency, will follow ``Beverly Hills, 90210'' and try to
make inroads against its key competition, ABC's potent ``Home
Improvement'' and ``Grace Under Fire.''
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
By an odd twist, CBS, which has won the ratings crown for three
consecutive seasons, goes into the 1994-95 shootout as the underdog in
the eyes of many industry observers. Not only has the loss of football
and the coming defection of stations over the next 1 or 1½ years left
a negative public impression but, more important in an immediate
sense, CBS is running into the increasingly red-hot ABC network.
</P>
<P>
Dependent heavily on older-skewing dramas and unable to develop
many pivotal blockbuster comedies, CBS also will be without four major
sports happenings that helped it to the top in recent years: the World
Series, the Super Bowl, the Winter Olympics and the weekly NFL games.
</P>
<P>
ABC, which might have won this season's ratings race if not for the
Winter Olympics and the out-of-sight ratings propelled by the Tonya
Harding-Nancy Kerrigan rivalry, seems well-armed for the coming
season, with comedies galore -- 16 of them -- and many of them hits.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
In addition, ABC will have the Oscars, the Super Bowl and the World
Series. The network was a solid winner in the May ratings sweeps, and
it has come on strong as this season progressed. It had the No. 1
show, ``Home Improvement''; the top new comedy, ``Grace Under Fire'';
the leading new drama, ``NYPD Blue'' and the highest-rated freshman
newsmagazine, ``Turning Point,'' a midseason entry.
</P>
<P>
Strengthened by such other comedy hits as ``Coach'' and ``Full
House,'' ABC has had the luxury to ``hammock'' some other new
contenders, such as ``Thunder Alley'' and ``Ellen'' (formerly ``These
Friends of Mine''), between successful shows, thus helping them to
successful launches.
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, CBS and other networks were crowing that this has
been a significant season for the networks, which actually went up in
overall viewership despite new TV alternatives. The Fox station raid,
while painful for CBS -- which could become more vulnerable to
acquisition -- may be a further plus for networks and viewers because
Fox chose to invest in free, over-the-air broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
For the first time Fox is reaching the potential -- in its station
penetration -- to pass one or more of the Big Three networks in total
household ratings.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
With NBC moving both ``Frasier'' and ``Wings'' to Tuesdays, Fox
will try to move in on Thursdays by leading off with two of its
popular sitcoms, ``Martin'' and ``Living Single.'' Both have black
stars, but Fox dropped five other series with black headliners -- 
``South Central,'' ``Roc,'' ``In Living Color,'' ``Sinbad'' and
``Townsend Television.''
</P>
<P>
However, some breakthroughs may be occurring in the minority area.
Margaret Cho, a Korean American stand-up comedian, has a new sitcom,
``All American Girl,'' on ABC. And Latinos are starred in several
series, among them Michael DeLorenzo in the police drama ``Uptown
Undercover'' and John Leguizamo in a planned midseason comedy sketch
show, ``House of Buggin','' both on Fox.
</P>
<P>
Overall, despite CBS' three-year reign, despite the
``Roseanne''-``Frasier'' matchup, the key development of the new fall
season could be a closer realization of a true four-network
environment. Once upon a time, it was just CBS and NBC.

 Haiti -- Orphaned by Its Latin Neighbors 
 Arria was Venezuela's U.N. ambassador and participated in the 
 Security Council's consideration of the Haiti crisis. He is a 
 visiting diplomatic fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Haitians go home! And stay there! This is clearly the message to
the poorest inhabitants of our hemisphere. The message is most audible
in the United States, where the fate of the first democratically and
constitutionally elected government of Haiti has become a domestic
political issue, largely due to the pressure exercised by black
American political leaders.
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, the U.S. government has its share of responsibility in
the failure of the international community to restore the government
of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. But its involvement, limited as
it is, has served to shield the failings of the Latin American
countries to assume, effectively and honestly, their collective
responsibilities within the inter-American system.
</P>
<P>
Haiti, after all, is in the Caribbean, not on some faraway
continent. It is the second-oldest independent country in the
hemisphere (after the United States). It is also the world's oldest
black republic. It should be known more widely that many Haitians died
fighting for the United States in its war of independence, and that a
Haitian president, Alexandre Petion, generously helped Simon Bolivar
to finance the campaign of independence of Venezuela, Colombia, Peru,
Bolivia, Panama and Ecuador. As part of these recollections, I would
add that it was the Haitians who handed Napoleon I, emperor of France,
his first defeat.
</P>
<P>
Is is evident, then, that the Haitians have not been free-riders in
the defense of their rights or in their solidarity with the peoples of
the United States and of Latin America in their struggles for
independence.
</P>
<P>
The Haitians have -- and continue to live -- a tormented history,
from enslavement by the French to the dictatorships of the infamous
Duvaliers and their current heir, Cedras; from the richest
sugar-producing colony in the Caribbean in the 18th century to the
extreme poverty of today.
</P>
<P>
Even though Haiti is part of the Americas, the general impression
in the region is that its problems are, and should essentially be, of
concern only to the United States. This impression is confirmed by the
strictly ritualistic and formalistic interest expressed by Latin
Americans. The sacrosanct principle of self-determination has served
them well as an excuse not to get seriously involved in the tragedy of
this black and poor member of our community.
</P>
<P>
The ``Haitians keep out'' message comes not only from Florida,
which already has generously received more than its share of refugees,
but also from the Latin American countries that do not welcome
refugees and are, if only through passivity, effectively
discriminating against their poorest sibling.
</P>
<P>
For the future of inter-American relations, it is sad and
disappointing to witness once more -- as if the case of the U.S.
invasion of Panama were not enough -- how the Latin American
governments continue to yield their responsibilities to the United
States in affairs in their own back yards. Also how they have so
easily discarded their historical debt to Haiti, a once independent
and generous nation. Yesterday the leadership was surrendered to a
U.S. ambassador, Lawrence Pezzullo; today to William Gray. Are the
principles of regional sovereignty and independence of action less
important than the principle of self-determination? Or is it plainly
that Haiti is not worth the effort?
</P>
<P>
Today, the Black Caucus of the U.S. Congress and the leadership of
other black Americans such as Randall Robinson provide the main
support for President Aristide's return to Haiti. Was it necessary for
the cause of Haiti to resort to ethnicity? The sad answer is yes.
Haiti in some ways is becoming a black Bosnia. In the Balkans, the
Bosnians are considered Muslim and as such, non-Europeans not worth
fighting for. The Haitians are black, not Latin, and as such, it
seems, also, not worth fighting for. Their only recourse, then, is to
appeal to their black brothers in the United States to influence their
government to act.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, there are no black caucuses in Latin America to
speak on behalf of their black and impoverished brethren on the island
of Hispaniola. So, for their own domestic political considerations,
the nations of Latin America will let Washington carry the ball and
bear the costs that an intervention may incur -- as well as the censure
for violating Haiti's sovereign right to suffer alone. Only then will
Latin America find it useful to remember that Haiti does not belong to
the United States but to the Organization of American States.

 HOME WORK: Spotting Garden Gems in Tiny Backyards 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You've finished the renovation, the dust has settled and you're
tired of being cooped up in the house. Or maybe you're partway through
a painting project and the weather's just too nice to stay inside.
What are you going to do for a break? How about a little work in the
garden?
</P>
<P>
Whether you're an urban pioneer or suburban dweller, a pretty and
comfortable garden can provide an oasis of civility, a place to
refresh mind and body, soul and eye.
</P>
<P>
We were pleasantly reminded of this recently at the annual
Victorian Garden Tour put on by Baltimore's Union Square neighborhood
association. None of the dozen or more gardens on the tour is large,
and most are as narrow as the 19th century rowhouses they belong to.
But even the tiniest of these had some touches that made them special,
and all together they were an encyclopedia of clever gardening ideas.
</P>
<P>
The homeowners have devised various ways to give character to the
blank rectangles most started with. Here are some of our favorites:
</P>
<P>
-- Tiny fountains. In one small garden, a half whiskey barrel had
been filled with a liner and a little bubbler-type fountain. It had
rocks, plants and even a couple of goldfish.
</P>
<P>
-- Arbors. One enterprising homeowner used copper tubing to make an
arbor of arches from the side of the house to the fence on the other
side of a narrow areaway. He is training vines on the pipes, but in
the meantime they're decorated with strings of tiny white lights.
</P>
<P>
Another yard had a simple, old-fashioned wooden arbor - basically
posts with a piece of lattice on top - draped with grapevines. In the
cool space underneath, white wrought-iron furniture made a pleasant
spot to sit and enjoy the garden.
</P>
<P>
-- Tiny fences. The same garden with the copper arbor had a tiny,
ornate wrought-iron gate leading into a square rose garden. The owner
said he cut it down from a piece of fencing left over from the front
walk.
</P>
<P>
-- Raised beds. Since a lot of urban rowhouses have paved back yards,
raised beds can provide an environment for plants without demolition
and hauling. We saw both tall raised beds, 2½ to 3 feet off the
ground, and short ones, as tall as one railroad tie. (If you're
planning to grow vegetables, you might want to consider using wood
that hasn't been treated with chemicals to resist insects and decay.)
</P>
<P>
-- Brick patios or walkways. In one long-ish yard, there were two
paths: a straight one that followed the fence to the back gate, and a
curvy one that wandered between wide border beds. The meandering path
made the garden seem much larger.
</P>
<P>
Garden projects are among the easiest and most rewarding you can
undertake. Even an element as dramatic as a pond, if you have space
for it, is remarkably easy. You can buy a rigid black plastic liner
and dig a hole to fit it, or you can dig a free-form space and fit it
with a flexible liner. (Just be sure the liner is big enough to cover
the excavation.) Add a plant step about 9 inches from the top, if
you're planning to add water plants.
</P>
<P>
Line the excavation with damp sand, drape the liner over it, and
place bricks or stones around the edge to anchor it. Gradually fill
with water, adjusting the bricks as the liner sinks to fit the
contours of the pond. Trim the liner, leaving about 6 inches to fit
under the edging. Flat stones are the traditional edging, but bricks
will also work.
</P>
<P>
Brick walks and patios are also easy to build.
</P>
<P>
As with ponds, the hardest part is the digging. Mark the sides of
the path or patio, and excavate about six inches. It's best to install
a permanent edge; you can use pressure-treated 2-by-6s, held in place
by stakes driven below ground level, or you can use concrete and pour
permanent sides and bottoms.
</P>
<P>
If you're not using concrete, put 2 inches of sand in the bottom of
the excavation and tamp it down (you can buy or rent a hand tamper).
Level it a brick's depth below the top of the edging (about 3 inches),
using a board notched on each end to ride on the edging. (For a large
space such as a patio, level with the longest board you can
comfortably use; check for level by placing a level on the edge of the
board at intervals.)
</P>
<P>
Deciding what pattern to lay the brick in is one of the fun parts
of the job - will it be straight, herringbone, diagonal herringbone,
lattice, or something of your own invention? Just be sure to use a
brick that is designed for paving. Some old bricks aren't glazed, and
will crack and crumble. Tamp the bricks into the sand with a board and
fill the gaps with more sand.
</P>
<P>
Some people line the excavation with black plastic sheeting to keep
weeds from growing between the bricks. The walk may still need
occasional weeding, and because it's set in sand, it will move with
the heaving of the earth, so you may have to reset a brick every now
and then. A concrete foundation will offer a relatively weed-free and
perfectly level surface, but it's a lot more work, more expensive, and
it won't have the hand-made charm of the sand.

<P>
Where I grew up in Colorado, ``Jet Noise: The
Sound of Freedom'' was the top bumper sticker -- without the question
mark . My father was a federal employee, and we lived between an Air
Force base and the Denver airport. Even today, a large proportion of
Coloradons work for the Defense Department and its contractors.
Colorado historians tell us we've always had this love-hate
relationship with Uncle Sam. Lately, it's all hate.
</P>
<P>
Here in southern Colorado, the Wilderness of the Sangre de Cristo
Mountains forms our fortress walls. The mountains are the most
ecologically diverse of any in the great Rocky Mountain chain.
Motorized vehicles are forbidden in the wilderness, but its airspace
is vulnerable to any intruder. We have always lived with some jet
noise, but lately the sound of freedom has turned deafening.
</P>
<P>
The Air National Guard, along with its Air Force allies, began to
besiege the region's six counties with its Colorado Airspace
Initiative, which would increase annual ``sorties'' -- screaming,
ear-rending, tree-top-level dogfights -- by thousands, with no upper
limit. The area would become a permanent Military Operations Area.
</P>
<P>
We made the mistake of demanding an Environmental Impact Statement,
hoping that we could state a scientific case against the Guard's
initiative. In return, we got an endless series of public meetings,
``scoping sessions,'' lies, inaccuracies, contradictions and evasions
 -- all paid for with our tax dollars. Whatever its grasp of military
tactics, the Guard understands war by attrition.
</P>
<P>
Unless the Federal Aviation Administration, which rules on all
military airspace, rejects the initiative, the Guard will bomb and
boom us to kingdom come.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
You can't hear, see or smell the enemy until too late, until he has
blasted you from a clear sky, dipped his wings in a mocking salute and
screamed on to torture your neighbors with his sonic booms and his
radar-confusing flares and aluminum-silicate chaff. Treetop-level
sub-to-supersonic flights have reverberated through the valleys around
the Sangres for at least 20 years. During the Cold War, we put up with
the bombs and booms. We took it for granted that behind them lurked
some deep, dark reason.
</P>
<P>
Then the Cold War ended. Then the effects on livestock became all
too clear. Then the effects on wildlife and pack animals in the back
country started to show. And then came the earsplitting, heart-racing
effects on a growing army of retirees and a real-estate industry.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
The war with the Guard has turned uncivil. The main event pits
ranchers, realtors and recreationists against a decrepit wing of the
U.S. Air Force. It wasn't that long ago when the ranchers and
recreationists were squaring off over wilderness designation. Indeed,
they didn't strike a deal until last year. But the Guard has kept them
united.
</P>
<P>
The Guard is about as rusty a weapon as there is the nation's
arsenal. In the last 40 years, America has called up the Colorado Air
Guard exactly once. Furthermore, the economies around the Sangres are
changing, from traditional ranching and timbering to a mix of
organic-beef or bison ranching, including a thriving business in
ranching-for-wildlife. The recreation industry includes a booming
second-home sector for retirees. More than 40 spiritual communities
have made the Crestone area on the Sangres' west side a world center
for contemplative religions.
</P>
<P>
The Guard claims that the new Denver International Airport
restricts its airspace. In the face of rising local and statewide
opposition, serious budgetary concerns and major environmental
effects, it is determined to expand its training in the area. ``We're
in it for the long haul,'' said Maj. Thomas Schultz, public-affairs
officer for the National Guard at Buckley Air Base. He says domestic
training operations are increasingly important for the national
defense, now that overseas missions have been sharply reduced. ``If we
don't fly, we lose our combat readiness,'' Schultz asserts. ``This is
a matter of pride for Colorado: Its 120th squadron was the first unit
to be federally recognized in 1946. The Air National Guard was born
here.''
</P>
<P>
The residents of the valleys around the Sangres are not impressed.
That's partly because so many of them are retired military or veterans
themselves. Take Ray Koch, a naval-aviation veteran and former
aerospace engineer for Martin Marietta. He spent years designing more
sophisticated versions of the hardware and software systems that drive
schemes like the Guard's. He doesn't have much respect for them or
their systems, which he regards as Stone Age technology. ``The Air
Guard is a dinosaur,'' he says, adding that low-level flight training
has about as much relevance to contemporary warfare as Kit Carson's
pistols. Cheap, readily available surface-to-air missiles have
rendered the Guard obsolete.
</P>
<P>
Koch has a solution to the dispute. He has designed a demonstration
of the Guard's latest proposal to minimize impacts on our valleys and
our wilderness. F-16s would overfly specific noise-sensitive points at
typical airspeeds and power settings. Video and audio equipment would
record the effects. Flight-data systems would correlate with ground
data to validate speed, power setting, altitude and aircraft altitude.
</P>
<P>
If the Guard's planes perform as it claims, we will leave our back
yard open to them. If they perform as we claim, they will leave our
back yard forever. The Guard has yet to respond. And so we continue to
cringe when we consider the fire danger from crashing planes and
flying flares. Could it be that silence has become the sound of
freedom?

 Both Sides Must Listen in Black-White Dialogue 
 Hall is a columnist for The Sun. 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From time to time, Richard T. Seymour of Baltimore will come across
something in the news about blacks that causes him to shake his head
in disgust and exclaim, ``There they go again!''
</P>
<P>
``But then I'll catch myself and remember, `Wait a minute, they
aren't all like that,'' says Seymour. ``I'll think: Bill isn't like
that. Dave isn't like that. A lot of the black people I do business
with or come into contact with during the day -- they aren't like that.
I'm painting blacks with a broad brush. Does this mean I'm
prejudiced?'' Seymour asks me rhetorically. ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
So then I confess to Seymour that from time to time, I find myself
shaking my head with equal disgust about whites.
</P>
<P>
``So, you see, it's a Catch-22,'' says Seymour. ``The circle of
prejudice just goes around and around and on and on.''
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, I wrote a column about how some businesses exclude
black models from their advertising, thus sending a subtle message
that such firms do not welcome black patronage. It was the sort of
commentary that made Richard T. Seymour shake his head in disgust and
exclaim, ``There they go again!''
</P>
<P>
So Seymour -- who owns an advertising business -- sent me copies of
Ebony and Essence magazines. And he wrote me an angry letter pointing
out that nobody ever ``comes down hard on the rampant racism of `black
publications.''
</P>
<P>
``Blacks are always crying `race','' said Seymour after I called
him. ``I mean, fair is fair. You've got black magazines, you've got
black student unions on college campuses, you've got a Black
Entertainment Television station on cable and a Congressional Black
Caucus in Washington. Blacks get away with racism that whites would
never be allowed to get away with. If you're going to complain about
one, you've got to complain about the other.''
</P>
<P>
Actually, there were a substantial number of white models included
in the ads in the very issues of Ebony and Essence that Seymour sent
me. Nevertheless, I think he has a point: Most blacks, I suspect,
would be profoundly offended by a magazine that celebrated white
culture and heritage with the fervor that Ebony celebrates African
American culture. A Congressional White Caucus in Washington? No way!
</P>
<P>
Are blacks guilty of a double standard with regard to racism?
</P>
<P>
``First of all, the Congressional Black Caucus has never disallowed
white members -- we have approximately 26 associate members who are
white,'' said Rep. Kweisi Mfume, the caucus chairman, when I put my
question to him. ``Second, the caucus exists to leverage opportunity
and enforce change for black people. In the absence of a civil rights
movement, the caucus is one of the most important vehicles for change
that blacks have.''
</P>
<P>
Mfume said that most whites either are unaware of the continued
disparities between blacks and whites in this society or they don't
care.
</P>
<P>
``There is a feeling in the larger community that `We've done
enough for blacks. We don't want to do any more,'' said Mfume. ``But,
in fact, every major indicator suggests that the disparities are even
more stark than they were 30 years ago. I hope and pray for a time
when we won't need a black caucus,'' he said. ``But realistically, I
don't expect that time to occur in my lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
John H. Johnson, the publisher and chief executive officer of Ebony
Magazine , makes a similar point: ``Until the two races are meshed or
merged or integrated, you will need both `white' and `black' media,''
Johnson said in a 1984 interview, provided by his office. ``If we
somehow reach a point in this country when race will no longer be a
factor, then Ebony will simply serve all the people. In fact, Ebony
would be a greater success than its white competitors, simply because
black people have more experience studying and meeting the needs of
whites than white people have had studying and meeting the needs of
blacks.''
</P>
<P>
Seymour conceded he was unaware of many of the continued problems
that make blacks feel they have to organize for change.
</P>
<P>
And, I conceded something too: Maybe blacks are too quick to cry
``racism'' whenever whites question our goals. Maybe both sides must
learn to listen.

WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Journalists and the corporations that employ them are
worriers. We worry about the economic survival of the news business,
about the ``meaning'' and social utility of what we do, about our
ethics and status and about our ``relevance'' to a public that seems
increasingly bored and turned off by the ``news'' as we have
traditionally defined it.
</P>
<P>
Howard Kurtz, the media critic of The Washington Post, published a
book last year in which he said, ``The smell of death permeates the
newspaper business.'' A headline in the trade magazine Editor 
Publisher last week notes the trend line on our health chart:
``Newspaper Circulations Plummet.'' The journalistic outlook at the
television networks is not sunny, either. As audiences for news
programming decline, some TV executives wonder aloud whether it makes
sense to keep the network news divisions alive.
</P>
<P>
Advertisers are deserting us for ``new media'' serving the special
interests of a fragmented, narcissistic society -- ``the culture of
contentment'' -- in which consumption is the dominant theme. Our young
people, Jay Rosen writes, ``have available to them not only a
substitute source of news, but a kind of substitute universe, an
alternative culture that is centered around television but is, in
fact, more pervasive. This ``everywhere culture' -- the culture of
popular music, Hollywood, MTV, ``Entertainment Tonight', People
magazine -- generates its own notion of currency ... (and) is loosening
the very ground on which the newspaper stands.'' Half of these people
 -- 18 to 24 -- never read a newspaper, and great numbers never watch or
hear the evening news.
</P>
<P>
If ``citizenship'' is defined as active and informed participation
in public affairs and the political process, they -- the young in
particular -- have become noncitizens along with millions of their
elders. While our politicians and editorial writers preach to the
world about the joys and successes of democracy, half the American
electorate ignores our presidential elections. Turnouts in off-year
congressional elections and in local elections of all kinds are an
international joke.
</P>
<P>
There are close relationships among the decline of citizenship in
this country, the decline of interest in traditional definitions of
``news'' and the decline of journalism's large role in the life of the
society. Rosen notes correctly that, ``To pick up a newspaper and scan
the front page is to feel yourself a member of a world in which
politics and public affairs matter.'' That has been true since the
late 18th century, and journalists have assumed ever since that our
intense interest-some might say obsession-in these affairs is shared
by the general population. However valid that assumption may have been
in some golden era past, it obviously has little validity today.
</P>
<P>
Vast numbers of Americans are not only turned off by politics and
public affairs, as their lack of participation and their lack of
interest in political journals demonstrates; they have become actively
hostile. E. J. Dionne, an editorial writer at The Post, wrote a book
on the subject a couple of years ago: ``Why Americans Hate Politics.''
</P>
<P>
The corruption of government at all levels by lobbyists and special
interests of every description is a factor. The frequent incompetence
and lavish waste of government bureaucracies and officials is another.
The character flaws of political leaders and candidates, the cliches
and psychobabble that pass for political discourse, the malign
influence of political consultants who brainwash and mislead us with
deceptive and irrelevant political advertising contribute
significantly to the public's alienation.
</P>
<P>
So does the incompetence and superficiality of the press. Post
political columnist David Broder has identified a central problem.
``Citizens,'' he has said, ``now perceive the press as part of the
insider's world. ... We have, through the elevation of salaries,
prestige, education and so on among reporters distanced ourselves to a
remarkable degree from the people we are writing for and have become
much, much closer to the people (experts and politicians) we are
writing about.''
</P>
<P>
Our professional lives are tied up with (and greatly dependent on)
the political elite -- government officials, lobbyists, bureaucrats,
consultants, experts and academicians. We socialize with them, talk
the same language, have the same interests, live in the same
neighborhoods, share lifestyles, schools for our children, clubs and
poker games. It is no wonder that the pictures of the world we present
to the newspaper audience and the spin we put on them are, in the
strict meaning of the word, the ``propaganda'' of the ruling class.
</P>
<P>
Tom Koch, a journalist and author of books on journalism, makes the
same point: ``For twenty years content analysis studies have shown
that between 70 and 90 percent of our content is at heart the voice of
officials and their experts, translated by reporters into supposedly
``objective' news. People don't trust us anymore ... because the way
we quote and attribute and build factoids as if they were truth is a
lie. And folks are catching on.''
</P>
<P>
They not only do not freely give us their trust, they often do not
understand us at all. We write in the argots of politics and the
bureaucracy and the academic world, which is as comprehensible and
useful to the masses as the journals of quasars, black holes and
quantum physics.
</P>
<P>
Because of uncertain prospects in the 21st century, there is a lot
of talk in the press these days about reinventing ourselves through
the marvels of technology -- electronics and the ``information
highway,'' for example. Others see a solution in design and artistic
innovation. But until we re-examine and change the way we conceive of
``news,'' until we redefine the ``reliable source'' and until we learn
to use a language that is accessible and meaningful to the apathetic
public out there, neither the press nor our political system will be
cured of its problems.

 Nations Detoured to Power Over Law 
 McNeill, a former president of the American Historical 
 Association, is the author of ``The Pursuit of Power.'' 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
D-day's success on June 6, 1944, together with a Russian victory at
Stalingrad 15 months earlier, assured that Nazi ambitions for European
and world domination would not be realized.
</P>
<P>
But when the common enemy collapsed in 1945, what British Prime
Minister Winston Churchill called the Grand Alliance swiftly broke
apart, giving way to Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Many Americans were distressed when their hope for a peaceful
postwar world failed to materialize, but hard-nosed observers
recognized the new international alignment that emerged between 1946
and 1950 as a classic example of balance-of-power politics.
</P>
<P>
This was exactly what wartime presidents Woodrow Wilson and
Franklin D. Roosevelt had hoped to banish from the Earth by making
international law enforceable. How ironic, then, that the United
States found itself unexpectedly engaged in a ruthless game of power
politics instead of relying on international law.
</P>
<P>
Does half a century's experience since the shocking international
realignments of the 1940s make us any wiser? It is hard to tell.
</P>
<P>
Hopes and fears about international affairs are less intense than
they were 50 years ago. But the decay of Cold War alignments and
motivations, like the decay of the wartime alliance, puts the future
up for grabs in an unusually drastic way.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the peace-keepers of the United Nations can really keep the
lid on international conflicts if the great powers cooperate. Perhaps
a new balance of power among rival states will emerge to replace the
Cold War antagonism. Or perhaps changes within the leading states of
the Earth have altered public life so much that old-fashioned
balance-of-power politics has begun to decay -- not because peace has
broken out, but because other kinds of conflict have begun to limit
and distract attention from intergovernmental rivalries.
</P>
<P>
As far as I can tell, all three of these alternatives -- which find
their origin at least in part in the victory of D-day -- are live
options. U.N. peacekeeping has not been uniformly successful, but as
long as the great powers refrain from taking sides, local wars remain
local and sending in outsiders to keep combatants apart might become
habitual.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if the great powers quarrel, they can easily
form rival blocs and alliances as aforetime. Radically different
lineups seem possible.
</P>
<P>
The classic balance-of-power response to the eclipse of the Soviet
Union would require the American Cold War alliance to split up.
</P>
<P>
Fortress America would then confront Festung Europa under German
leadership once again, with a new Japanese Co-prosperity Sphere in
Asia to challenge both. Alternatively, the United States and Japan
might ally against China; Russia might join or oppose western Europe;
India might join or oppose China in Asia, and so on. Permutations are
innumerable, but according to this view, the balance of power is
immortal, even if unstable, and compels statesmen to form and break
alliances willy-nilly.
</P>
<P>
The third alternative is more interesting to think about. Balance
of power is only as permanent as the states and governments that play
the game. But states exist only in the minds of the people they
govern, and if enough people feel themselves alienated, governmental
power can dissolve with quite surprising rapidity. This was what
happened to the USSR.
</P>
<P>
Other states may face similar difficulties in the future.
Subnational identities on the one hand and transnational connections
on the other have modified national politics already. A tangle of
overlapping rights, duties, obligations and beliefs, if they increase
in the future as they have been gaining power of late, might weaken
national identities and restrict the sovereign power of existing
governments far more than they are restricted today.
</P>
<P>
None of these scenarios is likely to bring peace to the world. But
the way people organize themselves into groups and distribute loyalty
among different and often overlapping groups makes all the difference.
Divided loyalties and plural identities are incompatible with total
war and marginalize balance-of-power politics.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps divided loyalties have already multiplied to such a point
that international behavior is changing in ways no one imagined in
1944 and no one yet fully understands 50 years after the D-day victory
that prepared the ground to make it possible.

 SCHELL COMMENTARY: Somalia Was Not a Mistake 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's become something of a commonplace to say that foreign policy
should not be governed by television coverage. The most prominent
example of the alleged abuse, probably, is the American intervention
in Somalia. In late 1992, the public witnessed almost daily television
coverage of hundreds of thousands of Somalis starving to death, and in
January President Bush launched Operation Restore Hope, whose purpose
was to deliver food and other supplies to the afflicted. No doubt the
Bush administration's reasons for intervening were complex. It is
clear, however, that it never would have taken place without public
acceptance, and that public acceptance was primed by the television
coverage.
</P>
<P>
Naturally, the action was attended by debate regarding the purposes
and justifications for intervention generally in the post-Cold War
period. Some argued that any human catastrophe on the scale of the
Somali famine was justification enough for international intervention.
Others feared that intervention for humanitarian reasons would quickly
lead to political and military involvement, which would prove both
interminable and self-defeating. This warning seemed especially
pertinent inasmuch as the famine, initially caused by drought, was
greatly extended and protracted by a civil war in which control of
food had become a weapon among the contending sides. By the time of
the American intervention, food sent by the outside world was piling
up in warehouses in Somali ports.
</P>
<P>
Later developments seemed to confirm the fear of involvement. In
October of 1993, 18 American soldiers were killed in a battle with the
forces of the Somali warlord Mohammed Farah Aidid, and the corpse of
one was dragged through the streets. The television images of this
event proved as powerful in pulling U.S. troops out of Somalia as the
earlier pictures of starving Somalis had been in pushing the troops
in. Within days, President Clinton vowed to withdraw U.S. soldiers in
six months. They are now gone.
</P>
<P>
This sequence of events left in its wake a widespread belief that
international intervention inspired by horror at faraway events cannot
lead to anything good: A frivolous public, it seemed, had first
lightly demanded intervention and then abruptly abandoned support for
it at the first sign of adversity. The Somalia intervention became a
byword for futility. That characterization is especially potent in the
current debate over intervention in the genocidal proceedings in
Rwanda, where government forces have massacred some hundreds of
thousands of members of the Tutsi tribe, and Tutsis have retaliated,
though on a smaller scale. A recent editorial in The New York Times,
for example, warned that intervention in Rwanda might turn out to be a
repeat of the ``debacle'' in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
This characterization, however, overlooks certain facts of epic
proportion. The most important is that hundreds of thousands of lives
were saved. The U.S. Agency for International Development estimates
the number at 500,000, and Oxfam America, the independent relief
organization, confirms the figure. Peggy Connolly, who traveled widely
in Somalia for Oxfam America in the spring, recently told me she found
nearly universal gratitude among Somalis for the international
intervention, and for the crucial American role in particular. Farming
has resumed, she found, and communities are rebuilding. ``And the
civil war is over,'' she added -- though she agrees with other
observers that the long-term political future of the country is
worrisome.
</P>
<P>
There may be sound reasons for the international community's
reluctance to intervene in Rwanda, but an alleged ``debacle'' in
Somalia should not be among them. Nor, in this case, did television
coverage inspire bad policy. The public saw starving people, and
wanted something done. Something was done, and hundreds of thousands
lived who otherwise would have died.

 LITTWIN COMMENTARY: Aborting Basic Freedom Sends Chilling Message 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Let's say you're an anti-abortion protester. You think abortion is
murder. And so, you believe you must do whatever you can to stop it.
</P>
<P>
As a pro-life advocate, however, you don't believe in violence.
</P>
<P>
In fact, you completely disavow the hard-core radical fringe of the
movement, the kind of people who killed Dr. David Gunn and firebomb
abortion clinics. You don't believe you can be pro-life and
pro-violence at the same time.
</P>
<P>
But you'll do anything short of violence. Because your conscience
won't allow you to do anything less.
</P>
<P>
So, as you try to stop people from going inside abortion clinics,
you hold true to your beliefs in nonviolence. You practice civil
disobedience, in the tradition of Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
You sit in front of a doorway, and you shall not be moved.
</P>
<P>
It's against the law, of course, just like the civil rights sit-ins
were. But you're prepared to be dragged away by police. You're willing
to spend a few days in jail and pay a fine, if you must.
</P>
<P>
But now the cost has gone up.
</P>
<P>
Now, the president has signed into law a bill that makes it a
federal crime to blockade an abortion clinic or related medical
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Violent offenders can face up to $100,000 in fines and a year in
prison for a first conviction. You wonder why they single out violent
pro-life advocates. Aren't violent acts already illegal?
</P>
<P>
You hear the oft-quoted numbers -- that since 1977, there have been
36 bombings of clinics, 81 cases of arson, 131 death threats, 84
assaults, two kidnappings -- but you don't understand what they have to
do with you.
</P>
<P>
The person accused of killing Gunn is in jail. Firebombers are in
jail.
</P>
<P>
You never firebombed or threatened anyone. What you do is plead
with women who are going inside for an abortion to reconsider. Some
call that intimidation. You say it's an attempt to persuade a woman to
do the right thing.
</P>
<P>
Some people call you a zealot. Maybe you are. Surely, it's not
against the law to be a zealot in America.
</P>
<P>
But now nonviolent offenders, the people who participate in sit-ins
blocking the entrance to a clinic and maybe even those who simply
kneel and pray in front of the entrance, face a prison term of up to
six months and a fine as high as $10,000 for a first conviction.
</P>
<P>
An additional conviction can bring 18 months and $25,000 in fines.
</P>
<P>
What do you do now?
</P>
<P>
The people who write the law say they're not after lawful
protesters. The people who write the law say you can still picket and
speak out. You wonder, though, about the risks. Who knows how the law
will be enforced? Who can say exactly where picketing ends and
blockading begins? Isn't this what they call a ``chilling effect'' on
protest?
</P>
<P>
These days, you feel like you have little recourse other than
protest.
</P>
<P>
The courts continue to rule against your cause. Most of the state
legislatures have gone over to the pro-choice side. Bill Clinton has
brought RU-486, the abortion pill, to this country.
</P>
<P>
You understand you hold a minority position. But you figure one of
the great things about America is that the Constitution protects the
right to hold unpopular positions.
</P>
<P>
Now you don't know. You wonder how Clinton, a former professor of
constitutional law, doesn't see this law as a First-Amendment problem.
</P>
<P>
You wonder how the ACLU, the dogged defenders of the First
Amendment, the same guys who defend the rights of Nazis to march, can
support this law.
</P>
<P>
You wonder what would have happened if, 30 or 40 years ago,
Congress had passed a law aimed specifically at civil rights
protesters who sat-in at lunch counters. How many sit-ins would there
have been with a six-month jail term as a result?
</P>
<P>
You wonder what would have happened if they'd passed such a law
during the Vietnam era, singling out protesters who sat down in front
of draft boards.
</P>
<P>
Actually, you don't wonder.
</P>
<P>
You know exactly what's going on. They say they want to stop the
violence at abortion clinics. You know that's a phony issue. Existing
laws handle that problem. What the people who back the law want is to
stop you.
</P>
<P>
What they want is for you -- and the entire anti-abortion protest
movement -- to just go away.
</P>
<P>
And if, in the process, the liberal establishment chooses to
disregard and even endanger principles it once fought so hard to win,
that's just the price we'll all have to pay.

 Celestial Furnishing Are In, But for How Long? 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About the time a home furnishings trend shows up on a bathmat, it's
washed up.
</P>
<P>
So it is with heavenly objects. Not that you'd know it by scanning
the stores and catalogs: Suns, moons and stars still fill the shelves
and cover multiple pages. But such is the nature of these trends -- 
just when they're everywhere, they're goners.
</P>
<P>
``It is post-peak,'' pronounces Raymond Berger, vice president of
Plummer-McCutcheon, which gave two entire pages to the celestial theme
in its most recent catalog.
</P>
<P>
During the decorating-down years (on average, people replace
furniture only 1½ times during their lifetimes, designer Vladimir
Kagan says), we freshen our nests with small decorative items. They
are to furniture what accessories are to fashion -- affordably priced
additions that stretch the life span of the major, expensive pieces.
And they're the fuel that fires yard sales of the future.
</P>
<P>
Where a furniture style can take five to 10 years to max out, a
decorating theme might come and go in a matter of months. With two
years on the scene, celestial items have had a long run.
</P>
<P>
There is no consensus on its exact flash point, but early signs of
the celestial look include a snow globe at a German gift fair, a
cotton throw at a New York gift show and needlepoint pillows at a New
York craft fair. Within a few months of those isolated sightings in
1992, the sun, moon and stars motif began appearing on everything from
clocks, dishes, candles, linens, napkin rings and watering cans to
shower curtains. As prices go, the merchandise leans toward the low
end.
</P>
<P>
If the celestial theme came out of the blue, the reasons for its
popularity are equally obscure. The brilliant yellow and orange
graphics on a dark blue background hardly enhance the favored
furniture styles of the day, such as Mission, nor do they complement
the reigning palette of faded colors.
</P>
<P>
``Perhaps it has a sense of mysticism, or escape,'' Berger
suggests. ``When it was at its peak, we were in a recession.''
</P>
<P>
Mystical iconography had another brief fling last winter when
angels sprouted wings and took off, seemingly overnight. They rated a
Time magazine cover before degenerating into swap-meet fodder. Now,
though, angels appear to be getting a second life. Moons, stars and
suns in pastels are being mixed with angels for some fairly rococo
combos. American country is moving toward fussy Victorian style, and
cherubs and moons fit right in with the lacy furbelows.
</P>
<P>
Design trends have traditionally trickled down from such high-end
sources as a furniture style, a designer's line or even a museum show,
but these days they often start, as the celestial theme did, at the
mass-market level.
</P>
<P>
``The middle level is where all the action is,'' says color
consultant Leatrice Eiseman of the Eiseman Center in Seattle. ``We
have a three-tier system of price levels. There is the high end, or
designer realm, the middle ground and then the low end, discount-price
level. Now that it is trendy and permissible to talk about saving
money and shopping at Price Club and Target, there is a lot more
attention being paid to the middle level. The mass market is getting
more attention, and new things are being introduced at this level.''
</P>
<P>
Sunflowers were another graphic phenomenon that bloomed midfield,
as part of the American country look of several years ago. Cows and
gingham also figured into the farm scene, but sunflowers ultimately
struck out on their own to bedeck rugs, teapots, vases, linens, coffee
mugs and candlesticks. Some are designed to look like folk art, others
are done in dark, muted colors to complement Mission-style furniture,
and still others are as garishly bright and sickeningly sweet as
daisies and happy faces -- two overused devices from decades past. The
sunflowers are also starting to fade.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Chili peppers, ivy and fruit have also been popular in the
middle-price range but will probably have disappeared by this time
next year.
</P>
<P>
On an ascent are African-inspired items. Such fabrics as kente
cloth have caught on in the textile and fashion markets and fueled a
growing selection of African-like prints on linens and dinnerware.
</P>
<P>
``I think African-themed items will be a fairly important
classification,'' says Mary Morris, vice president of Ross-Simons,

Also on the rise is a home-wares trend influenced by a furniture
style referred to variously as Bloomsbury chic, palace trash,
neo-ancestral and shabby chic. About two years ago, the severely
trendy began collecting old chairs with moth-eaten, worn, velvet
upholstery and displaying them just like that -- decrepitly shabby. The
idea was to have furniture look as if it had been in the family for
generations -- as in old family, old money.
</P>
<P>
The decorative bits accompanying this theme are intentionally
mismatched, worn and patched. The plates are different from the soup
bowls, the mirrors need re-silvering, and the sofa cushions are
upholstered in one fabric, the back and arms in another.
</P>
<P>
Now, furniture manufacturers are reproducing the look. ``It's in
the $1,000-sofa range now,'' Berger says. ``I've seen slipcovers with
incredibly creative mixes of fabrics. One piece of upholstery may have
six fabrics on it.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
The shelves of American Rag Maison et Cafe in Los Angeles are
stocked with like-minded items. ``We are going for a mixture of
things, rather than one look. Stripes and patterns on pillows. We mix
two different types of plates -- things from cafes and things from flea
markets,'' owner Margot Werts says.
</P>
<P>
At stores with more moderately priced merchandise, wine glasses
with mismatched stems come as a set and pillows have a mix of
patterns. The Pottery Barn, for one, offers a sofa upholstered in
ticking stripes combined with faded cabbage roses.

 Homelessness: Putting Money Where the Concern Is 
 The following editorial appeared in Monday's Los Angeles Times: 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The most promising element of the Clinton administration's
ambitious new plan ``to break the cycle of homelessness and prevent
future homelessness'' is the amount of money requested from Congress.
The administration seeks an unprecedented $1.7 billion, which would
more than quadruple the funds now available to heavily impacted areas.
</P>
<P>
Washington would not dictate how the new money would be spent.
Rightly, that would be a local determination. By law, nonprofit
organizations -- the key players in the recent assault on homelessness
 -- must get 51 percent of the funds. That mandate would allow groups
that have long provided scarce social services and built affordable
housing to collaborate rather than compete for crumbs.
</P>
<P>
The administration's plan is expensive because the Clinton team
honestly acknowledges the scope of homelessness, and the complexity of
the multiple challenges. The federal plan cites recent studies finding
that between 500,000 and 600,000 people are homeless on any given
night.
</P>
<P>
Christopher Jencks, a sociology professor at Northwestern
University and the author of the new book ``The Homeless,'' believes
that the number of the ``visible homeless'' -- who live in shelters or
public places like doorways, parks and cars -- is between 300,000 and
400,000. Jencks links the recent increase in the numbers of aggressive
panhandlers and confused or babbling men and women pushing shopping
carts in large part to the proliferation of cheap crack cocaine and
government's failure to provide adequate mental health treatment.
</P>
<P>
Two of three single adults who agreed to the voluntary and
anonymous drug testing requested by the Cuomo Commission at New York
shelters tested positive for cocaine, according to Jencks. In family
shelters, 16 percent tested positive. Jencks puts overall drug use at
25 percent, and notes that it makes the users even less employable,
deprives them of money for rent, drives away friends and family
members who could give them shelter and in general prolongs their
homelessness. They need drug treatment, job training and additional
low-cost housing.
</P>
<P>
One of three homeless people is severely mentally ill, according to
Jencks. Many wouldn't be on the streets if states still operated the
warehouse-like mental hospitals that were common in earlier
generations. According to Jencks, these people require
hospitalization, outpatient programs, rent vouchers to pay for
board-and-care facilities or government support for relatives willing
to provide care.
</P>
<P>
Despite these daunting challenges, Henry G. Cisneros, the head of
the Department of Housing and Urban Development, promises to reduce
homelessness by one-third.
</P>
<P>
Helping sick people who hear voices, fear others and are prone to
violence is difficult. As the Clinton plan and the Jencks book
indicate, they need more than a place to live. Providing treatment,
services and financial aid will require a long-term commitment from
Washington.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration deserves credit for tackling a thorny
social problem with a request for significant new funds and a
well-thought-out plan of action that is long overdue. Now does America
have the political patience required to make this plan successful?

 Real Estate Ads Undergo Alterations (Narberth, Pa.) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NARBERTH, Pa.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lynn Duffy has been writing real-estate ads for so
long she could compose them in her sleep. A spacious home in an
upscale, secluded setting near jogging trails conjured up phrases like
``executive living,'' ``sports enthusiasts take note,'' ``quiet
neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
But that was before the ``red-light words.'' Duffy Real Estate now
avoids the term ``executive''; it could be racist, since most
corporate executives are white. Singling out ``sports enthusiasts''
could discourage the disabled. ``Quiet neighborhood'' could be a code
for ``no children.''
</P>
<P>
Duffy knows of firms that are even avoiding ``master bedroom'' (it
suggests slavery), ``walk-in'' closet or ``spectacular view'' (some
homebuyers cannot walk or see).
</P>
<P>
Real-estate agents in Philadelphia's affluent Main Line suburbs are
not suffering an attack of political correctness. Like their
counterparts in many states, they say they are afraid of being charged
with housing bias by increasingly vigilant, local fair-housing groups
and individuals who are filing more and more discrimination cases over
real-estate ads in newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Most complaints concern blatant violations of the federal Fair
Housing Act and state and local housing laws -- such as ads seeking
``adults only'' or ``no children.'' But a complainant listing her
religion as ``non-Christian'' has charged a Gannett newspaper in
Salem, Ore., with religious discrimination for an ad published on
Easter Sunday under a logo of a bunny in a flower basket bearing the
words, ``Happy Easter.'' The Department of Housing and Urban
Development is investigating.
</P>
<P>
And a Pennsylvania fair-housing official said a real-estate agent
recently pulled an ad for a ``rare find'' in Chester, Pa., after a
reader complained that it was racist to describe as ``rare'' a nice
house in a largely black community.
</P>
<P>
National civil-rights leaders are as upset about these complaints
as are real-estate agents and newspapers. They say they consider them
a ``trivialization'' of the act's intent and a diversion from the
fight against real housing discrimination.
</P>
<P>
University of Pennsylvania law professor Lani Guinier, who has
become a national voice on civil rights since the furor over her
failed nomination to a Justice Department post last year, sees the
struggle as a symptom of national confusion over how to communicate in
an age of growing sensitivity to individual differences.
</P>
<P>
``We have to find a way to establish the legitimacy of people's
concerns without allowing every concern to define the debate,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
Asked this month at a Senate hearing whether HUD would prosecute
the use of terms such as ``master bedroom'' or ``walking distance to''
trains, assistant HUD secretary Roberta Achtenberg, who oversees Fair
Housing Act enforcement, said firmly: ``HUD has never taken any such
position, and we would not under my administration.''
</P>
<P>
``If one of my members brought a complaint like that, I'd choke
them,'' said Shanna Smith, executive director of the National Fair
Housing Alliance, which works with local fair-housing groups across
the country.
</P>
<P>
But Achtenberg and Smith cannot stop individuals who feel aggrieved
from bringing complaints to state or local human-relations
commissions, regional HUD offices or state or federal courts.
</P>
<P>
Tim Kearney, program co-ordinator for the Fair Housing Council of
Montgomery County (Pa.), said that he hopes one day to test the law by
suing over gray-area words.
</P>
<P>
``If somebody didn't pick up the phone (to respond to a housing ad)
because they felt excluded by the wording, you have a complaint,'' he
said. ``All day long some people suffer stings and pangs of
discrimination, and it adds up. That's what civil rights is all
about.''
</P>
<P>
And a senior official of the Pennsylvania Human Relations
Commission, which enforces the state housing law, said there is no way
of knowing how a hearing officer would rule on any complaint, even
``master'' bedroom. ``We say to the newspapers and the Realtors,''
said the official, who insisted on anonymity. `When in doubt, leave it
out.' ''
</P>
<P>
This ambiguity is driving time-consuming efforts by real-estate
agents and newspapers to anticipate even far-fetched claims of
liability under the Fair Housing Act.
</P>
<P>
While the financial penalties are not always severe, the litigation
costs of cases that go beyond the complaint stage often reach tens of
thousands of dollars. And housing-law violations are grounds for
revoking an agent's license in some states.
</P>
<P>
The federal act bars housing discrimination in all forms, including
any notice or ad that ``indicates any preference, limitation, or
discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, handicap,
familial status or national origin or an intention to make any such
preference ...''
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for associations of real-estate agents and newspapers say
they receive calls every day from clients around the country, asking,
``Can I use this word?''
</P>
<P>
``In Hawaii, some people say, `We can't say the house has a
Japanese garden,' '' said Fred Underwood, vice president of the
National Association of Realtors. ``I answered, `Do only Asian
Hawaiians like Japanese gardens?'''
</P>
<P>
The main problem, he said, is there is no way to list all
discriminatory words, because many are in the eye of the beholder -- 
and there are so many beholders. ``A real-estate concern called two
HUD offices in New Jersey and asked about `walking distance to
synagogue and deli,' '' Underwood said. ``One office said it's fine;
the other said no,'' because it constituted religious steering.
</P>
<P>
The Philadelphia Inquirer now urges advertisers to say ``convenient
to (shopping)'' rather than ``walking distance.'' The Baltimore Sun
instructs its advertisers to say, for example, ``three blocks to ...''
Numerous newspapers and real-estate agents around the country have
foresworn phrases like ``convenient to jogging trails,'' for fear they
discriminate against disabled people, ``ocean view'' in deference to
the blind -- phrases cited in a 1991 complaint in Oregon -- or ``ideal
for empty nesters,'' which could be discriminatory against families
with children.

 Political Jockeying in Germany 
 The following editorial appeared in Monday's Baltimore Sun: 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The year was 1969. The site was Berlin. The circumstance was the
election of a new German president, a largely ceremonial post. The
stakes were nothing less than control of the Bonn government after
election of a new Parliament -- and a chancellor -- later in the year.
</P>
<P>
On that occasion, the Cold War was much in evidence as Soviet and
East German officials harassed the arrival of delegates to the
election assembly from all over Germany. But the ceremony went ahead.
And when it was over the election of the first Social Democratic
president since the Weimar Era in the '20s proved to be a harbinger
for the triumph of that party's leader, Willy Brandt, in late summer.
</P>
<P>
The key to Brandt's victory was the liberal Free Democratic Party,
which switched allegiance from the conservative Christian Democratic
Union to the Social Democrats. It was to reverse course in 1982,
putting in office the current chancellor, Helmut Kohl (but that is
another story).
</P>
<P>
What happened this week in Berlin was another presidential
election, this one in which the Free Democrats, reluctant and divided
as ever, stuck with the Christian Democrats rather than risk political
oblivion. Chosen president was Chief Judge Roman Herzog of the Supreme
Court, Kohl's choice but hardly a favorite in the country.
</P>
<P>
The question now in German political circles is whether, as in
1969, the Free Democrats will prove again to be the decisive element
in German politics. Only this time, as Herzog's victory indicated, the
FDP has determined to keep leaning right to support Kohl rather than
swing left to align itself with his SPD challenger, Rudolf Scharping.
Latest public opinion polls indicate that Kohl, though still behind,
is gaining as the economy improves.
</P>
<P>
Whatever the outcome, Germany is about to be denied the leadership
of its most popular politician. Not Kohl. Not Scharping. Not the FDP's
Klaus Kinkel. Rather, the nation will lose the services of Joseph von
Weizsaecker, who in his 10 years (the limit) as president has come to
embody the conscience of a country that still feels ``abnormal,'' a
nation haunted by its Nazi past. President von Weizsaecker has
constantly warned against neo-Nazi eruptions and against intolerance
toward foreigners. His successor, despite a bumbling beginning, must
do nothing less.

 Securities Litigation Can Be Confusing (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A growing number of Americans are being caught up in
securities litigation and are being forced to make potentially
important decisions with little understanding of what is going on or
what is at stake.
</P>
<P>
It is common today for investors to find in their mail a document
filled with dense language and fine print telling them something about
a company they have invested in. Figuring out what it is, and then
deciding what action to take is mission impossible for many investors.
But those decisions may make the difference between recovering money
and going without.
</P>
<P>
Often, as in the case of a failed company, a class action is
investors' only hope of restitution. But sometimes, as with Humphries,
joining the suit, intentionally or not, may prevent them from
participating in a better deal that may have been worked out by a
regulatory agency.
</P>
<P>
Such problems have become so widespread that the subject was taken
up at last week's meeting of the Securities and Exchange Commission's
newly formed consumer affairs advisory panel, said Louis M. Thompson
Jr., president of the National Investor Relations Institute, an
association of corporate investor relations officials.
</P>
<P>
``When investors are informed of a class action, (the notices) are
so legalistic they can't even understand what they are getting
involved in or are not getting involved in,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of investors apparently just throw these notices away,
but that in itself is a form of decision.
</P>
<P>
Typically, when a class action is brought seeking monetary damages,
the courts employ what is called an ``opt out'' procedure, meaning
that anyone who fits the definition of the class is automatically
included unless they take action to opt out, said Stephen J. Toll of
Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld Toll, which handles many class action
suits.
</P>
<P>
This makes it easy if you want in, but can be a pitfall for the
unwary -- or for anyone who for some reason doesn't get the notice.
</P>
<P>
People who don't get the notice, who throw it away as junk, set it
aside but forget it or otherwise don't respond, will be swept into the
class. And when the case is decided or settled, they will be bound by
the result.
</P>
<P>
In many cases, Toll said, investors first receive a notice that the
suit has been filed and that they may opt out if they wish to. Later
they may receive another notice that the case has been settled, and
that they may file a claim. Sometimes, he said, the second notice
offers another chance to opt out, but generally not. If not, then the
investor is locked into the settlement. If the investor doesn't file a
claim, he or she won't get any money, but will still be bound by the
settlement.
</P>
<P>
Sometimes when a case is settled before the class is certified by
the judge, the notice and claim form are combined, and an investor may
opt out at that point, Toll said.
</P>
<P>
If you get a class action notice, Toll and others suggested
thinking about it this way: How big is my investment and how good is
my claim?
</P>
<P>
If your investment is large and your claim strong, Brenner said,
``you're probably better off out of the class'' so you can sue on your
own. Since class actions lump weak and strong claims together and give
both kinds of claimants the same settlement, the good claims to a
certain extent subsidize the weak ones.
</P>
<P>
If your claim is strong, but your investment small, you are
probably better off in the class because it is not economically
practical to bring your own case.
</P>
<P>
And, of course, if your claim is weak, you are definitely better
off in the class.
</P>
<P>
In general, said Toll, ``the only reason to opt out is to preserve
your rights'' to sue.
</P>
<P>
Still, critics charge that many class action lawsuits are
frivolous. The stock goes down so somebody sues. Some studies indicate
that the plaintiffs individually don't get much money in these cases.
</P>
<P>
``I tend to be rather skeptical (of such suits) because the law
firms that bring them tend to make a bundle and the shareholders who
would be participating wouldn't get that much out of it,'' said Maria
Crawford Scott of the American Association of Individual Investors in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
In most cases, if an investor has suffered a loss because a company
or partnership went under, regulatory agencies do not become involved
and the class action suit may be the investor's best hope of salvaging
something from his or her investment.

 Anthropology: Violence Is Nothing New 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Death by violence was at least 50 times more common among ancient
peoples than it has been in the modern world, according to a new study
of ethnographic records and human remains found in ancient burials.
Still older prehistoric societies had violent death rates thousands of
times higher. Recurrent warfare appears to have been the chief reason.
</P>
<P>
``The price we pay in our modern civilization for being divided
into nation-states is far lower than what we would be paying if the
world were still tribalized,'' said Lawrence Keeley, an anthropologist
at the University of Illinois at Chicago, whose findings are being
published next year as a book by Oxford University Press.
</P>
<P>
Keeley calculated that if the world's current population were
undergoing warfare at the rate attributed to prehistoric peoples, 22
million people would die violently every year. In fact, the highest
estimate of violent deaths of all kinds during the entire 20th century
is around 100 million.
</P>
<P>
Keeley's study focuses on societies that lived between 12,000 years
ago and the present. Among the more recent tribal societies, the
annual death rate from violence -- averaged from estimates by various
anthropologists who studied them -- is close to 0.5 percent. In other
words, this is the percentage of people who die by violent means each
year. In the United States today, the comparable figure is around 0.01
percent -- 50 times less. (This is usually expressed as 10 violent
deaths per 100,000 population.)
</P>
<P>
In still older prehistoric societies, Keeley said, the violent
death rates, probably largely from warfare, appear to range between 1
percent and 40 percent. He cited one village site dated at A.D. 1325
in what is now South Dakota. ``There were 50 houses in this town,
which meant that around 800 people lived there. Every house in the
town had been burned to the ground.''
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists found a mass grave containing skeletons of more than
500 people. Of the skulls that could be found, 94 percent bore
scalping marks. Most of the bodies had been badly mutilated and left
to rot.
</P>
<P>
Keeley said it is a myth that ``pre-civilized'' life was peaceful
and happy, and that Western civilization is the root of all evil. ``As
societies evolve and become larger and more complex, less violent ways
of resolving disputes are institutionalized,'' Keeley said. ``What
prevents war is politics.''

 Scientists Surprised by Light Flashes From Earth 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The planet Earth is a flasher.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, several different scientific teams have detected
mysterious bursts of light in the upper atmosphere, apparently linked
somehow to thunderstorms. Scientists and others have seen them from
the ground, from airplanes, from the space shuttle and through robot
observatories in orbit. They have seen them in optical wavelengths and
in intense microsecond sizzles of radio waves -- and now in the form of
high-energy gamma rays.
</P>
<P>
A team using NASA's orbiting Gamma Ray Observatory, designed to
scan the cosmos for powerful celestial sources of the rays, reports in
the May 27 Science that it has seen at least a dozen Earth-flashes in
two years.
</P>
<P>
``The last thing we ever expected to see was gamma rays coming up
from Earth,'' said Gerald Fishman of Marshall Space Flight Center, who
led the team. ``But about a week after we reached orbit, we started
seeing flashes coming from below the spacecraft.'' Collaborating with
weather and lightning experts at Marshall, the team used old weather
satellite photos to determine that there were always storms nearby
when the flashes occurred. The bursts could originate in a rare type
of high-altitude electrical discharge above storms, possibly the
result of lightning bolts that punch through the top of a thunderhead.
</P>
<P>
Estimated to begin at altitudes no lower than about 19 miles -- well
above the storm cloud tops -- and to rise as high as 63 miles, the
flashes lasted from 1 to 8 milliseconds -- too short to pose any
danger. They carried the signature of emissions from million-volt
electrons decelerating rapidly (known as bremsstrahlung radiation).
About half had a double pulse, and one had five.
</P>
<P>
However, according to a companion commentary by Richard Kerr, to
create these effects would require superbolts -- 30 times more powerful
than normal.

 GOP Enlists Scholar for Assault on Cuomo 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
She is hardly a household name, but New York Republicans hope
Elizabeth McCaughey will make life as miserable for Democratic Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo as she did earlier this year for President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
McCaughey tore apart Clinton's health-care plan in a long and
devastating Feb. 7 New Republic article that forced the White House to
issue a point-by-point rebuttal and drew a rebuke from the president
himself.
</P>
<P>
Now she has been transformed from think-tank scholar to political
candidate as the New York Republican Party's endorsed candidate for
lieutenant governor, and one of her principal roles, says the man who
put her on the ticket, is to distinguish the difference between
Cuomo's rhetoric and his record.
</P>
<P>
``Betsy has done such a spectacular job on the health-care plan ...
I have no doubt she will do a tremendous job'' on Cuomo's record, said
state Sen. George E. Pataki, the Republicans' endorsed candidate for
governor and the man who put McCaughey (pronounced McCoy) on his
ticket. Pataki, who was the handpicked candidate of Sen. Alfonse M.
D'Amato, R-N.Y., said that, despite strains and schisms evident all
year, Republicans emerged from their state convention last week ``with
an overwhelming sense of optimism'' about the fall campaigns.
</P>
<P>
McCaughey, after a day crisscrossing the state, said she is eager
to serve. ``I've spent 25 years studying American government,'' she
said. ``I adore our system of government. It's the freest and most
enduring democracy every created, so the idea of participating as an
elected leader is very exciting to me.''
</P>
<P>
Most Republicans who endorsed her nomination had barely heard of
McCaughey, but her clash with Clinton has given her unique celebrity
status. After all, how many other candidates for lieutenant governor
have posed for Vanity Fair in a loaned designer gown?
</P>
<P>
``I was quite shocked by it myself,'' McCaughey said after seeing
the photo. A specialist in 18th-century history, she had hoped the
magazine would use a close up picture of her and an image of George
Washington.

 New Battle of Alamo Over What to Preserve (San Antonio) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SAN ANTONIO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If it had not been for the Daughters of the Republic
of Texas, there would not even be an Alamo today. Instead of this
familiar limestone shrine, this monument to liberty or death, there
would be just another downtown hotel.
</P>
<P>
For nearly 90 years, the Daughters have protected the Alamo,
restored it, tended it and treated it like the most precious real
estate in Texas.
</P>
<P>
And now, as the Daughters see it, this is the thanks they get:
</P>
<P>
Ethnic minorities have accused them of ignoring other claims to the
site. An adjoining park has been proposed that could, they fear, turn
the Alamo into Disney World. A new historical perspective has reduced
their heroes to lily-livered scoundrels. And at every turn, the
Daughters have been assailed as hidebound, amateurish and stubborn -- 
dowagers with nothing better to do than drink tea and plot more ways
to justify their blindered version of the past.
</P>
<P>
It has been most unpleasant.
</P>
<P>
``The Daughters are willing to look, listen and talk,'' said Gail
Loving Barnes of Odessa, who wears the ceremonial ribbon sash of the
group's president-general and speaks softly, but crisply, about the
controversies.
</P>
<P>
``We have been content all these years to work to preserve the
Alamo, the shrine to Texas liberty. We did not seek publicity. We did
not pat ourselves on the back. I realize now our foremothers should
have arranged for some positive publicity years ago, so people would
know what we were doing all along.''
</P>
<P>
Some critics have gone so far as to suggest the time has come for
the Daughters of the Republic of Texas to relinquish control of the
site, which draws 3 million visitors a year and ranks as one of the
country's more compelling attractions. That is a possibility the
Daughters can describe only as unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
``We will never give up, just to put it bluntly,'' Barnes said, as
other members shook their heads in emphasis.
</P>
<P>
They refer to themselves as The Daughters. There are about 6,600
members of this unique and exclusive group; to qualify, an applicant
must provide irrefutable evidence her ancestors were early colonizers
of what became Texas in the years before 1845.
</P>
<P>
History is greatly revered in the Texas scheme of things. Every
little Texan is taught that he or she lives in the most fascinating
state in the Union -- what other state was ever a country all its own?
</P>
<P>
Six of the top 10 tourist attractions here are historic sites, and
students begin learning Texas history in the first grade, largely due
to the Daughters' heavy campaigning. The names Jim Bowie, William
Travis and Davy Crockett, the shining heroes of the Alamo, are as
familiar to youngsters as Batman.
</P>
<P>
No battle is more sacred here than the siege of the Alamo, the
fight for Texas independence from Mexico. It has all the essential
stirring elements: an outnumbered band of patriots holed up for days
inside a former mission, a rousing agreement to fight to the death, a
brutal annihilation that paved the way to a greater triumph.
</P>
<P>
For 13 days in 1836, Col. Travis and 188 men managed to stave off
the ferocious Mexican Gen. Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna and his 4,000
well-armed troops. Finally, in the pre-dawn hours of March 6, the
Mexican forces stormed the fortress, slaying all but a few women and
children and burning the bodies of the resisters. Although Santa Anna
dismissed the conflict as a minor affair, he had lost 600 men.
</P>
<P>
Forty-six days later, the stage was set for the Battle of San
Jacinto, when Gen. Houston led his 800 volunteers to defeat the
Mexican army, and the Republic of Texas was born.
</P>
<P>
Incensed by the Alamo's fall and inspired by reports of the heroics
there, Houston's men coined a rallying cry that has since become a
standard expression in American language: ``Remember the Alamo!''
Texas switched from sovereign country to on of the United States in
1845.

The Daughters, founded in the 1890s as a historic-preservation
society, entered the picture in 1905, when the Texas legislature
granted them custodianship of the crumbling and neglected Alamo.
</P>
<P>
Clara Driscoll and Adina de Zavala, two founders of the group, had
saved the site from destruction; it was coveted for a new hotel. Since
then, there have been regular tempests at the Alamo, but the Daughters
agree the latest series of assaults -- depicting them as blue-haired
control freaks or worse, white supremacists -- has gone beyond normal
bounds.
</P>
<P>
One after another, critics have emerged to attack the fortress.
Gary Gabehart of the Inter-Tribal Council of American Indians says the
Daughters are wrong to concentrate solely on the siege, that the Alamo
should also honor the 921 mission Indians previously buried at the
site.
</P>
<P>
Gilberto Hinojosa, a dean at Incarnate Word College, wants more
emphasis on the Alamo's role as a mission. Historians have raised
doubts about the very worthiness of the heroes -- Houston may have been
an opium addict, Davy Crockett a sniveler.
</P>
<P>
David Anthony Richelieu's serious plan to expand the Alamo site to
its former football-field-sized proportions has filled the Daughters
with dismay.
</P>
<P>
``The DRT has had this little domain, and people are jealous,''
said Richelieu, a columnist for the San Antonio Express-News who has
closely followed the disputes and belongs to a special, city-appointed
committee to study the questions about the Alamo.
</P>
<P>
Visitors to the shrine on a recent afternoon hardly seem repelled
by the disputes. Dozens of people prowled the lush green grounds,
marveling at the smallness of the Alamo (the mission itself is tiny,
and the compound covers only 4 acres) and its surprising location.
</P>
<P>
Many first-time visitors expect the Alamo to be situated, alone, on
a windswept hill, but downtown San Antonio sprang up around the site,
and a Wendy's and a Woolworth's loom across the street.
</P>
<P>
The Daughters do not like it that lost in the controversy is the
fact the group has never charged for admission to the Alamo, meeting a
budget that now reaches $2 million a year with donations and the sale
of Alamo-shaped ashtrays and coonskin caps. Not a penny of tax money
has ever gone to the Alamo.

 Timing of Betrayal Prompts Questions (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Among the double agents that former CIA officer
Aldrich H. Ames has admitted exposing to Moscow was Oleg Gordievsky,
the KGB's onetime top officer in London and the most important Soviet
spy ever recruited by MI5, Britain's security service.
</P>
<P>
Problem is, Ames can't say exactly when he told Moscow about
Gordievsky.
</P>
<P>
The FBI had concluded it was on June 13, 1985, when Ames turned
over to a Soviet Embassy employee in Washington an envelope containing
a list of code-names or other identifying clues for all the Soviet
citizens he knew were in the pay of the CIA or allied governments. The
FBI fixed on that date using photographic, electronic and other
surveillance records that are supposed to have recorded all those who
visited the Soviet Embassy, sources said.
</P>
<P>
But the FBI did not consult with Gordievsky or read the book that
he wrote in 1990, the sources said. In the book, Gordievsky said he
was mysteriously ordered back to Moscow from London on May 17, 1985,
four weeks before the FBI has Ames turning over his list. Gordievsky
also wrote that on May 27, 1985, he was drugged, interrogated by KGB
officials in the Soviet Union and ``directly accused of working for
the British.''
</P>
<P>
Ames has said he cannot remember the date he passed the envelope,
but during an interview last month placed it ``some months'' after
March 1985. Neither MI5 nor the CIA wants it proven that Ames was not
the one who informed on Gordievsky because that would suggest another,
still undiscovered double agent inside either U.S. or British
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
The FBI, sources said, has been asked to review its finding.
</P>
<P>
Gordievsky himself announced after Ames's arrest that he believed
it was Ames who turned him in. ``He has the blood of a dozen officers
on his hands,'' Gordievsky wrote in an article in March. ``He would
have had my blood, too, had I not managed to escape before the KGB had
any evidence, other than Ames's tip-off, against me.''
</P>
<P>
Some British intelligence officials, although accepting the CIA's
apology, have come to believe that Gordievsky was uncovered by the
KGB's own counterintelligence work and that Ames's information only
confirmed an existing suspicion.
</P>
<P>
Motivated by his realization that the Soviet Union was a stagnant,
corrupt society, Gordievsky agreed to spy for British intelligence in
1974 while working as a KGB political intelligence officer in
Copenhagen. He rose steadily in the KGB in Moscow and arrived in
London in 1982. Three years later he was named chief of the KGB's
station in the British capital.
</P>
<P>
So impressive was Gordievsky's information that some of his reports
were hand-carried to then-President Ronald Reagan. They gave top
leaders in London and Washington what one former high-ranking CIA
official called ``an amazing look inside the Kremlin.''
</P>
<P>
From London Gordievsky would report on gossip he gathered and
conversations he had with visiting Soviet officials and KGB officers.
His reports covered China, Nicaragua, even the United States. The
information he conveyed about the internal workings of the Kremlin
``went way beyond any reporting we were getting,'' the former CIA
official said.
</P>
<P>
Only a handful of top CIA officials knew the material was coming
from a KGB source in London and from an individual senior enough to
assume charge on occasion of the Soviet Embassy there. Ames, along
with a handful of other officers in the CIA operations directorate,
was able to determine that MI5's source came from the KGB station in
London.
</P>
<P>
According to Gordievsky, he was unexpectedly recalled to Moscow in
a cable he received May 17, 1985, saying he would be formally
appointed head of the KGB's London operation and two Politburo members
wanted to talk to him. When he arrived in Moscow on May 19, he found
his apartment had been searched.
</P>
<P>
For a week nothing happened. Then he was taken to a KGB dacha
outside Moscow for a lavish lunch that included large amounts of
liquor. After the meal he felt drugged.
</P>
<P>
He was then subjected to sharp questioning for the rest of the day,
including accusations he had become a British agent. He denied the
charges and maintained his innocence.
</P>
<P>
Gordievsky was released, but his wife and children were ordered
back from London and he was told he would not be allowed to serve
outside the Soviet Union again. He was relieved of duties and told he
had to report to KGB headquarters for a new assignment on Aug. 3,
1985. Gordievsky wrote in his book that he believed the Soviets were
waiting to see if they could catch him secretly meeting with MI5
agents.
</P>
<P>
On July 19, without giving notice to his family, Gordievsky and MI5
agents carried out a bold escape plan. He was picked up by MI5 agents
on a street outside Moscow while jogging with a KGB guard just yards
away. He was smuggled out of Russia through a route that remains
secret.

 Once-Divisive Loan Guarantees Can Help Build Mideast Peace 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The issue of Israeli settlers and settlements in the West Bank and
Gaza cannot go long ignored. If mishandled, the fate of the settlers
will undermine the prospects for later stages of Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the $10 billion U.S. loan-guarantee program -- just two
years ago the single most contentious issue in U.S.-Israeli relations
 -- could serve as a vehicle of conciliation and peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin has courageously said that
peace is more important than settlements. So far he has given no
indication of how, or under what conditions, settlements might be
removed. But Israel has the capacity on its own to adopt non-coercive
policies that could at least reduce the magnitude of the settler
population, leaving until later negotiations the precise details of
how settlements will be dealt with in a final peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
When the Camp David accords were signed in 1978, some 10,000
Israelis lived in the West Bank and Gaza (beyond the expanded
municipal boundaries of Jerusalem). Then, during the 1980s, the
Israeli government intensified substantially its financial incentives
to lure more Israelis to settle in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The goal was to make it impossible for any future Israeli
government to relinquish the area. As a result, more than 130,000
Israelis now live in the territories, excluding those in expanded
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
American aid, up until 1991, contributed to the settling of the
West Bank by cushioning what would otherwise have been a substantial
drain on the Israeli budget in the form of subsidies to settlers. Now,
when peace is a real prospect, the time has come for the United States
and the Israeli government to reverse the financial incentives.
</P>
<P>
An appropriate instrument for this is the $10 billion
loan-guarantee program authorized by Congress in 1992 to provide
housing for hundreds of thousands of Jews expected to emigrate from
the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Since actual immigration has turned out to be less than
anticipated, the loan guarantees -- now largely unused -- could
facilitate emigration from the territories by financing housing within
pre-1967 Israel for tens of thousands of returning Israeli settlers.
</P>
<P>
Here's how such a program might work:
</P>
<P>
-- Relocation assistance would be made available to families that
agree to leave apartments and homes in the territories.
</P>
<P>
-- These properties would become the property of the Israeli
government and might at some later date be transferred to
Palestinians, within the context of final status negotiations.
</P>
<P>
-- The amount of assistance provided would decline over time. In the
first year, $100,000 per family might be made available. This could be
reduced in $20,000 increments each year, so that settlers waiting
until the fifth year would receive only limited compensation. In
short, those who leave early will be rewarded.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are approximately 25,000 Israeli families living
in the territories. If, in each of the next five years, 4,000 families
took advantage of the program, the cost to the Israeli government
would be just over $1 billion dollars, a limited part of the total $10
billion in U.S.-guaranteed loans.
</P>
<P>
A program of this sort will not draw the most ideological of the
settlers from the territories, and it can also be expected that
smaller groups of extremists committed to violence will not leave in
response to financial incentives. But polls show that even now more
than 30 percent of the settlers are ready to leave if compensation is
provided. And this number will grow once the process is started.
</P>
<P>
The program could be implemented unilaterally by the Israeli
government; no negotiations with the Palestinians are required; and no
coercion would be involved. Moreover, it would still leave open the
future of the settlements themselves and of those settlers who remain.
</P>
<P>
By agreement, those issues are to be dealt with in the final-status
negotiations, which according to the Declaration of Principles are to
``commence as soon as possible but not later than the beginning of the
third year of the interim period.''
</P>
<P>
The advantages of assisting the settlers to leave now are
compelling.
</P>
<P>
By reducing the size of the settler population, the problem of
dealing with settlements in the final status negotiations will be
significantly easier, both to negotiate and to implement. Indeed, if
this is not done, the settlement question may prove ``a deal breaker''
in the final status talks.
</P>
<P>
A government-assisted exodus of settlers would also send the
clearest possible signal to the Palestinians that the Israeli
government is serious about ultimately withdrawing from the West Bank.
This would greatly strengthen the position of Palestinian moderates
who have been negotiating with the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a major return of Israeli settlers from the territories
would help limit violence in coming years. With respect to extremists
on the Israeli side, it would demonstrate that the effort to create
permanent facts on the ground has failed and that Israelis were
leaving the territories regardless of attempts by extremists to
disrupt negotiations.
</P>
<P>
An exodus of settlers from the territories would also refute the
claim of Palestinian extremists that the only way to end the
occupation is to mount violent attacks on Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The precedent of ample compensation paid to settlers who left the
Sinai when peace was achieved with Egypt has created an expectation of
compensation among Israeli settlers. They will not leave without it,
and the real choice is whether the process begins now or in five
years. Logic says do it now.

 Betsey Wright, Clinton's Loyalist Opposition (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
She is a web of contradictions -- a woman whose name is
almost synonymous with loyalty to Bill Clinton but who has a way of
giving him bouquets laced with stinkweed.
</P>
<P>
Betsey Wright, President Clinton's longtime chief of staff during
his Arkansas governor days and now a Washington lobbyist, is widely
regarded as smart and politically savvy. But for some reason, she says
things on occasion that make other Clinton advisers cringe.
</P>
<P>
She coined the phrase ``bimbo eruptions'' in an interview during
the presidential campaign -- on the spur of the moment, she later said,
because she couldn't bring the term ``gold digger'' to mind. It was
meant to be snide, putting down the women who claimed past liaisons
with Clinton, but quickly took on its own life among Republicans and
the media. ``Nobody ever told her to say anything about it,'' says a
former Clinton campaign aide. ``She just came out with this quote.''
</P>
<P>
Most recently, she has been at the center of a small controversy
over her statement, as quoted in a novella-size article about Hillary
Rodham Clinton in The New Yorker, that ``a great many people (are)
talking very seriously'' about a potential Hillary run for the
presidency. Such comments come at a bad time, when polls are showing
renewed suspicion of the first lady's power after she'd attempted to
put those concerns to rest. Wright denies making those remarks. But
opinion in Clinton circles is split.
</P>
<P>
``Sure she said it,'' says one White House staffer. ``She wants to
be the center of attention. And she becomes the center of attention
and realizes that it doesn't help her, so she backs off.''
</P>
<P>
``I have never heard her in public or private utter anything that
was not in support of Bill and Hillary,'' says Bev Lindsey, executive
director of the Department of Arkansas Heritage and wife of White
House senior adviser Bruce Lindsey. ``I know Betsey wasn't out there
saying some of those things that were quoted in the article.'' Bev
Lindsey adds that she also was misquoted in the piece.
</P>
<P>
Clinton campaign strategist James Carville, who has often clashed
with Wright, is giving her a sort of backhanded benefit of the doubt.
He suspects that Connie Bruck, author of the New Yorker piece, ``set
out to get somebody to say that'' and persisted until someone did. It
was ``the journalistic equivalent of a forced confession,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
The normally talkative Wright wasn't returning calls last week. But
Bruck is standing by her quote -- and she says she didn't browbeat
Wright to get it. ``You couldn't browbeat Betsey -- that's my sense of
it,'' she says. ``I didn't feel that she intended to harm Hillary and
Bill. Was I a little surprised that she would say something that I
realized when printed could be startling? Yes, I was surprised.''
</P>
<P>
If Bruck was surprised, others weren't. Some speculate that Wright
is seeking a subtle form of revenge because, after years of devoted
service to Clinton, she wasn't given a leading role in the
presidential campaign. Others speculate that if Wright's performance
is sabotage, it isn't conscious. Either way, some Clintonites have
been asking themselves: With friends like Wright, who needs Rush
Limbaugh?
</P>
<P>
-- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
The Texas-born Wright has been a lifelong political player. She met
Bill and Hillary Clinton in 1972, when all three worked on George
McGovern's presidential campaign in Wright's home state. After Clinton
became governor of Arkansas, then lost his re-election bid in 1981,
Wright relocated to Little Rock. That's when she began a relationship
with Clinton that she would subsequently describe as ``almost
symbiotic.''
</P>
<P>
Wright was happy to be Clinton's lightning rod, associates say, and
to absorb the bolts that otherwise would have struck her boss. In
exchange, however, she demanded control -- no scrap of paper passed
through the office without her involvement.
</P>
<P>
She was a renowned workaholic who virtually never took time off -- 
showing up between 5 and 6 a.m. each day and staying late. So when she
abruptly departed for a rare vacation in August 1989, Arkansans
noticed.
</P>
<P>
``I am told that Bill and Betsey have been at each other's throats
lately, but that this is not particularly unusual,'' Arkansas
Democrat-Gazette political columnist John Brummett wrote then. ``Their
relationship apparently is volatile, love-hate.'' Clinton blamed
Wright for a political initiative that had put him into uncomfortable
conflict with state legislators, Brummett continued. ``Her
abrasiveness used to get on my nerves and I considered her too
protective of the boss. But now I realize that Bill needs protection
sometimes, and Betsey has kept him out of a lot of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
Wright's vacation turned out to be permanent, and the transition
was handled none too smoothly. If Wright felt that Clinton had pushed
her toward the door -- or at least failed to support her adequately -- 
she never said so publicly. She served at Clinton's request as head of
the state Democratic Party, throwing herself into an ambitious and
relatively expensive program of organizing the machine. In September
1991, with the party more than $25,000 in debt, she resigned. She had
``spent far too much'' on 1990 elections, she acknowledged. Wright
herself hadn't been paid for months.
</P>
<P>
-- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
In 1992, she contacted the presidential campaign after Gennifer
Flowers surfaced with her allegations about an affair with Clinton.
She knew the real dish on Flowers, Wright said later, and others in
the campaign didn't. In her view, these newcomers -- James Carville,
George Stephanopoulos and the others -- permitted the Flowers story to
get bigger than it should have.
</P>
<P>
Wright joined the campaign team -- but she never fit in very
comfortably. With her sense of proprietorship, Wright was not fated to
get along with the campaign's ``white boys,'' as some insiders dubbed
them. ``Can you imagine what happened when Carville started screaming
and yelling and Betsey didn't shut up and started screaming and
yelling back at him?'' one campaign aide says. But Wright wasn't
someone to be dismissed lightly. She knew Clinton very well. Everyone
assumed she had nuclear capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Those who are loyal to Wright -- and they tend to be longtime
Clinton allies with Arkansas roots -- maintain that the ``War Room''
crowd was harder on Wright than they should have been.
</P>
<P>
Brummett says Wright recounted to him a meeting with Carville and
Stephanopoulos in which they criticized her because some of Clinton's
potential liabilities had not been resolved in the past. ``One said,
`How could you let Bill Clinton be governor for 10 years and not
answer the marijuana question?' And she began to cry.'' But Wright
also maintained that she had tried -- that on some points, Clinton was
hard to manage. ``And what did Carville and Stephanopoulos get him to
do?'' Brummett asks. ``He stood up and said he didn't inhale.''
</P>
<P>
Wright acknowledged some of the stress she felt during the campaign
in tearful comments that she made at a post-election forum of campaign
players at Harvard. She complained bitterly about attacks on Arkansas
and Clinton's record as governor, including some that came from within
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
But at the same forum, Wright continued with remarks that didn't
necessarily favor Clinton. A reporter asked Carville why Clinton never
denied having an affair with Gennifer Flowers.
</P>
<P>
``He certainly did,'' Carville replied. ``He said it any number of
times.''
</P>
<P>
``Now, what he said, James, was ... '' Wright interjected. ``Let's
not do a slick Willie here.'' He had said that Flowers was lying,
Wright explained. ``And she was, and she has been lying since she was
3 years old.''
</P>
<P>
A defense of Clinton, perhaps -- but one that raised the very
possibilities that Carville had been attempting to dispel.
</P>
<P>
-- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
After the election, Wright came to Washington. She never had a job
in the administration -- and said she didn't want one. After years of
service, she said, she was broke. It was time for her to earn some
money and, pushing 50, time to prepare for her retirement. She joined
the Wexler Group, lobbying with some success on behalf of the American
Dietetic Association and the American Forest and Paper Association.
Wright has demonstrated that she can tap straight into Bill or
Hillary's office at least to get her clients a hearing, even if their
wishes aren't always granted. The relationship ``has been a good thing
for her, for us, for our clients,'' says Anne Wexler.
</P>
<P>
Arkansans are much warmer to Wright than the crowd that gathered
around Clinton during and after the presidential campaign. They know
she is complicated and volatile, but she also is one of them -- 
certainly more so than the boys in the War Room. They recognize her
past loyalty to Clinton and offer their own support.
</P>
<P>
``Arkansans have an appreciation of the history,'' says Skip
Rutherford, a Little Rock attorney who formerly chaired the state
Democratic Party and worked in the Clinton campaign. ``The truth of
the matter is, she came in and helped Bill Clinton after a stunning
defeat. She helped position him for a '92 victory.'' The Carville
crowd ``got Bill Clinton as he was -- a national candidate,'' he says.
``We saw Bill Clinton coming out of the ruins of an upset defeat. And
what we saw was Betsey Wright rebuilding the tower.''

 More U.S. Firms Cut off Health-Care Coverage of Retirees 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Retirees are increasingly finding themselves on their own when it
comes to health-care coverage.
</P>
<P>
A new survey shows that most companies in the United States cut
employees off from all coverage the moment they retire, and those that
continue to provide coverage shift most of the cost onto the retiree.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide study of 2,395 employers by A. Foster Higgins Co.,
a New York-based benefits consulting firm, shows that among large
companies -- those with 500 or more employees -- workers who take early
retirement are somewhat more apt to get continued coverage than those
who have reached age 65 and are eligible to receive government health
insurance under Medicare.
</P>
<P>
Among large companies, 46 percent provide some form of coverage for
early retirees, while only 39 percent provide insurance for
Medicare-eligible retirees. But fewer than one in five large employers
is willing to pay the entire cost of health care for retirees, while
40 percent of the companies that do offer some form of health-care
coverage require the retiree to pay all the costs.
</P>
<P>
Even at full cost, however, it may be cheaper for a retiree to buy
coverage from his or her ex-employer than to buy an individual
insurance policy.
</P>
<P>
Stephne Behrend, the managing consultant who conducted the survey,
one of the larger of its kind in the United States, said it showed a
continuing ``gradual erosion'' in employer health-care benefits for
retirees. ``Each year we've seen a significant number of companies
that say they've terminated their benefits for retirees,'' Behrend
said.
</P>
<P>
A new Census Bureau study shows a similar decline in employer
health-care coverage for active workers. The overall percentage of
workers covered by employer health plans, it concludes, dropped from
66 percent in 1979 to 61 percent in 1993. Labor Secretary Robert B.
Reich said the Census report shows a drop in coverage in every
category of workers and employers.
</P>
<P>
Behrend said that this year Foster Higgins revised its survey
methods to gauge better what's taking place among smaller companies.
``What we get is a much better picture of smaller companies and just
how limited post-retirement benefits are from smaller companies,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
The survey, she said, shows there is not a great difference between
large and small companies when it comes to health care benefits for
active employees. ``The difference really happens in the smaller
companies when you get to the post-retirement area,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey report, ``small employers are much less
likely to offer retiree coverage; only 8 percent offer coverage to
retirees under age 65 and 9 percent offer it to Medicare-eligible
retirees,'' generally people age 65 or older.
</P>
<P>
Benefit consultants have long maintained that the availability of
health care benefits is often a major factor in retirement decisions
by employees. The Foster Higgins survey underscores that.
</P>
<P>
``Whether or not an employer offers retiree coverage appears to
have some effect on employees' retirement decisions, since most
employees are not eligible for Medicare until they reach age 65. ...
Two-thirds of those retiring were under age 65,'' according to the
survey.
</P>
<P>
Among small companies, people tend to hang on longer so that they
can move straight to Medicare. At companies with fewer than 500
employees, the survey showed, 70 percent of those retiring were over
age 65.
</P>
<P>
The survey also said that 73 percent of small employers required
both early retirees and Medicare-eligible retirees to pay the full
cost of any company-provided insurance benefits.
</P>
<P>
Behrend said that even with the retiree paying the full cost,
however, it provided some advantage for the retiree because it often
guaranteed the continuation of coverage regardless of preexisting
medical problems.
</P>
<P>
The Foster Higgins survey showed that the cost of providing health
care benefits to retirees rose an average of 7.9 percent last year.
The average cost per retiree was $2,735 in 1993, compared with $2,534
the year before.
</P>
<P>
When the age of retirees is considered, there is a dramatic shift
in costs to the company. The survey shows that the average cost for
early retirees, those under age 65, was $5,216 per employee. The cost
for people 65 and older, who can tap Medicare, averaged $1,786.
</P>
<P>
This is particularly relevant in today's work force as major
corporations, often those with the most expensive health-care plans,
continue to reduce the size of their work force and turn to new
technology to become more competitive.
</P>
<P>
During the first three months of the year, an average of more than
3,000 jobs was lost each day as the result of corporate downsizing.
That number began to slow slightly to fewer than 2,000 jobs a day in
the second quarter of the year. Many companies have used retiree
health benefits to lure older employees to leave.

 Longtime Los Angeles Times Reporter Paul Green Houston Dies (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul Green Houston, a longtime Washington
correspondent for the Los Angeles Times and author of its popular
weekly ``Washington Insight'' column, died late Sunday after a
two-year battle with colon cancer. He was 52.
</P>
<P>
Houston joined the Los Angeles Times in 1965 as a staff writer in
Los Angeles and was assigned to its Washington bureau in 1972. He
first covered the California congressional delegation before his beat
was expanded to include all of Congress. He served a term as chairman
of the Standing Committee of Correspondents, the organization of news
reporters assigned to Congress.
</P>
<P>
Houston played a prominent role in The Times' coverage of the
Watergate affair, including the impeachment proceedings against former
President Nixon, and later the Iran Contra scandal. Several years ago,
drawing on his experience and contacts, he took over the newspaper's
Washington Insight column, which features behind-the-scenes glimpses
of the capital's processes of power.
</P>
<P>
``He had the best sources of anyone on the Hill,'' said Times
Washington Bureau Chief Jack Nelson. ``I covered impeachment with him,
and he had better sources than I did. He was extremely well-liked.''
</P>
<P>
Said House Speaker Thomas J. Foley, D-Wash., ``Congress had a good
many journalists covering the Hill in recent years, but Paul Houston
was in the handful of the best. Few had covered it longer or better.''
</P>
<P>
Houston, who was named after the Pulitzer-prize winning playwright
and family friend Paul Green, was born into a writing family in Chapel
Hill, N.C. His father, Noel Houston, was a prize-winning journalist
and novelist who authored the best-selling 1946 novel ``The Great
Promise.'' His mother, Kay Replogle Houston, was a noted gardener and
cook.
</P>
<P>
Houston demonstrated an early interest in journalism in his high
school years and then as an English major at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill where he wrote for the Daily Tar Heel and was
assistant sports publicity director for the university. He was
graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1963.
</P>
<P>
After graduation, he moved to Houston where he worked as a reporter
for the Houston Chronicle for a year, and then joined the San
Francisco Examiner, where he worked for another year. In 1968, at 25,
he became the youngest recipient of the Nieman Fellowship for
journalists at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
He was an avid sportsman who enthusiastically pursued tennis, golf
and body surfing, and, in fact, scored 81, with two birdies, in a golf
match four days before entering the hospital for the last time this
month. He was also a devoted cook, reader, trombonist and punster.
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his widow, Virginia; two daughters, Katherine and
Susanna; and a sister, Diana Houston, all of the Washington area.

 50-Year Workers Remember a Different Capital (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What's approximately 48,000 years old, has 1,394 legs,
is steady, generally healthy and likes to work? Those are the combined
stats -- more or less -- of the 697 men and women who have been in
federal government service here 50 or more years. Most were in their
20s, or teen-agers, when they came to work before D-Day. They have
been on the job longer than the average American has been alive.
</P>
<P>
At a time when the federal government is pushing early retirement
and paying workers $25,000 bonues to leave, people who stick around
for 50 years stick out! Some are the institutional memory of their
agency.
</P>
<P>
All the club members were on the job before President Clinton was
born, before TV or CDs or PCs, and when the outcome of World War II
was still in doubt. Their Washington was a boom town where movies were
run night and day to accommodate shift workers, and where women vastly
outnumbered men in most government offices.
</P>
<P>
Most walked or took the trolley (10 cents) to work. About that time
The Washington Post launched a ``Government Girl Plane Drive.'' The
idea was to get $1 from G-girls (that was a legal term in those days)
to buy a warplane for both the Army Air Corps and the Navy. The White
House supported the drive. Each aircraft was to be named GOVERNMENT
GIRL and each would carry a logbook with the names of all donors.
Donors names were posted in front of the Post building.
</P>
<P>
It was a different town and time.
</P>
<P>
One who remebers is Bernice Watson. She's with the Federal
Mediation and Conciliation Service. Mid-June marks her 50th year in
government. Like thousands of other G-girls (including my mother) she
was recruited from small towns to come to Washington. Many planned to
work for the duration of the war, then go home. A lot of them are
still here.
</P>
<P>
Watson and the late Muriel Fortenberry Freeman, came fresh from
high school to be civilian clerk-typists in the brand-new Pentagon
building. The young ladies, from Magnolia, Miss., took the 26-hour
train from New Orleans to Washington's Union Station. After signing
forms, they were taken to their government-approved rooming house at
No. 2 Logan Circle. A vigilant landlady insured that no men -- 
patriotic locals and Nazi spies were equally suspect -- ever got above
the first floor lounge area. Watson giggled when she remembered the
lounge ``dance band'' a nickelodian that supplied tunes for
not-too-close dancing. Working a 5 and a half day week for $38 left
little time or money for exotic entertainment.
</P>
<P>
Like many of the wartime temps, Watson stayed and added to the
city. Her son, Lawrence Thomas, is now a lieutenant in the
Metropolitan Police Department. She still lives in town.
</P>
<P>
Why has she worked so long?
</P>
<P>
``Well, I had a good reason, I needed the money,'' she said. Now
she works because otherwise ``I'd go crazy. ... You have to get out of
the house.'' She likes the FMCS, and it likes her. If you can't be at
her June 15 luncheon party, raise a glass from wherever for that
hang-tight, hang-tough 50-year bunch.

 How Raju Went From New Delhi's Slums to Film Fame 
 in `Little Buddha' (New Delhi) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW DELHI, India
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nine-year-old Raju and his big brother, Mantu,
had a carefully choreographed scam they pulled on unsuspecting
tourists.
</P>
<P>
The two boys would leave their home in the slums for the city's
busiest market center, where they would target a well-shod Westerner
on a stroll. The fleet-footed Mantu would sneak behind him and squirt
shaving cream on the back of a shoe. Raju of the sweet face and big
doelike eyes would step into the tourist's path, point to his shoes
and say, ``Hey, man, your shoes are dirty. I clean them.'' He'd then
fleece the tourist at 10 times the going rate for a shoeshine, more if
the guy looked rich and overly gullible.
</P>
<P>
Suresh ``Baba'' Varma, a movie production executive who splits his
time between Los Angeles and India, frequently walked past the little
scam artists and would tease Raju, the more gregarious of the pair:
``Some day I'll make a film and give you a chance to be a star.''
</P>
<P>
``Ha,'' scoffed Raju, a rail-thin boy small for his age. ``No you
won't. Nobody gives me a chance.''
</P>
<P>
But in nothing less than a Cinderella story for the poor shoeshine
boy, one of 11 children of a Rajasthani Gypsy who fed his family by
making plaster gods and idols, Varma kept his word.
</P>
<P>
In the summer of 1993, Varma was in Katmandu, Nepal, screening
children for the role of a child Buddha in Bernardo Bertolucci's
``Little Buddha,'' the tale of a Buddhist teacher believed to be
reincarnated in three modern-day children. ``I feel like I looked at
every single kid in Nepal between the ages of 7 and 10,'' says Varma.
</P>
<P>
But none of the youngsters seemed right for the role. One day Varma
spotted the Delhi shoeshine boys on the streets of Katmandu -- pulling
their same old tricks. Raju and 11-year-old Mantu had joined their
nomadic father on his annual migration to Nepal, following the holiday
selling season for plaster gods and goddesses. Varma pulled them into
a scooter rickshaw and took Raju for an audition.
</P>
<P>
``I believe in karma,'' says Varma. ``I know the script. I see his
face -- this kid had a lot of energy in his face. I know this is the
boy. He's the one.''
</P>
<P>
One week Raju Lal Sehansra was pulling his scam on the streets of
the city by day and living in fetid slums by night, and the next week
he was practicing lines in a foreign tongue, wearing chic new Western
clothes and learning to love alien foods such as spaghetti, which he
had to eat with a fork instead of his fingers.
</P>
<P>
In the months of on-the-scene filming of ``Little Buddha'' in Nepal
and Bhutan, Raju experienced the kind of lifestyle about which poor
Indian families dare not even fantasize. For his scenes, he was draped
in colorful robes and perched on a throne as a young lama. He watched
his favorite movie, ``Home Alone,'' dozens of times. He was showered
with toys and Western clothes he'd only seen from the outside of the
stores. Not to mention that he was paid $12,000 -- more money than his
father could expect to make in a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
The conversion from shoeshine boy to movie star was not always
easy. The language barrier was a major problem. The producers hired
Mantu, who spoke more English than his little brother and was a faster
study, to coach Raju and ended up casting him in a small part in the
movie.
</P>
<P>
In Katmandu, Varma helped relocate Raju's entire family to the
biggest house they'd ever occupied. The good deed ended in disaster.
After a few weeks, Raju's father -- whose skills in plaster had been
put to work on the movie set and even landed him a bit part as a
mechanic in ``Little Buddha'' -- approached Varma and pleaded, ``Please
take us out of here. I was living in the slums. If I had to go to the
toilet I'd just walk out anywhere. Here we have to wait in line. I
want some fresh air. I feel like I am in jail.''
</P>
<P>
At the end of the shoot, there were promises of more movies, maybe
even one based on Raju's own life. Indian advertisers wanted to hire
him to plug their products on television. Varma vowed to get the boys
out of the slums. He hired dancing instructors to coach them and
planned to enroll them in Delhi's best schools.
</P>
<P>
But with ``Little Buddha'' now playing in the United States -- it
opened in Europe months ago, to mixed reviews -- the Cinderella tale is
dimming. Raju has had no new movie offers, and Delhi's private schools
refused to admit the two brothers because their family is from a poor,
low caste and their father has spent a large chunk of their earnings
on extravagant village weddings for two of his older children.
</P>
<P>
The movie production company has put the remaining money in a trust
and allows the family to draw only the monthly interest. Even so, that
amount is more than the entire family earned each month making idols,
shining shoes and selling maps at inflated prices to tourists. So, for
the most part, their father has stopped working and Raju and Mantu
hang out in the slums, doing occasional interviews and hoping for
another movie offer.
</P>
<P>
Like many of India's poorest people, the boys' 47-year-old father,
Jai Lal Sehansra, doesn't think much about the future: ``We are small
people. We can't have big dreams. My only dream is that all my
children grow up and get married and become good people. That is
enough for us. There is no basis for dreaming. If you can't have it,
why dream at all?''
</P>
<P>
But Raju and Mantu do dare to dream.
</P>
<P>
``In the future I want to be a big actor,'' says Raju. ``Before I
didn't think about it.'' And that has given the other children the
incentive to dream. ``If my brothers become so famous, why shouldn't
I?'' says 11-year-old Meera, a delicate-faced girl wearing braided
pigtails and a tiny nose stud.
</P>
<P>
Has temporary stardom and a taste of life beyond the narrow alleys
of the slums changed the two boys?
</P>
<P>
Their mother, Parvati, looks up from the bucket of black water
where she is washing her cooking pots just outside the front door of
the house. ``I don't see any change. They sit and eat roti the same
way.''

 Midterm Election Blues: Democrats Try to Shift 
 Focus From Clinton (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Democrats love to call theirs the party of
compassion, and so their reaction to losing a Kentucky House seat last
week was all the more unusual: They shot the wounded.
</P>
<P>
Joe Prather, the former Kentucky Democratic chairman and state
Senate leader who lost his election to Congress on Tuesday, was
attacked by his own party leaders for running a lousy campaign.
Democrats sounded like the Americans in Vietnam: They had to destroy
the village to save it. After losing two House seats in a month, and
every key race over the past year, the Democrats were desperate to
tell people -- particularly their own nervous candidates -- that these
losses had nothing to do with President Clinton's unpopularity or with
the party's policies. That was not selling, even among many Democrats.
</P>
<P>
Democratic leaders are the first to admit that this is likely to be
a tough year. Internal forecasts say the party could lose from 18 to
more than 30 House seats this fall. Losses on the high end of that
range would wipe out Clinton's majority in the House.
</P>
<P>
Several things are working against the Democrats this year that go
beyond the normal cyclical trends of midterm elections:
</P>
<P>
-- Voters are still angry at Congress and incumbents. That puts the
Democrats, with far more incumbents, in greater jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
-- Retirements have hit Democrats harder than Republicans, and these
open-seat races are more susceptible to switching parties than seats
with an incumbent running for re-election. That was the case in
Kentucky, where the late Rep. William H. Natcher (D) had held the
Republican-leaning district for four decades. There are 46 open seats,
and the number is likely to grow.
</P>
<P>
-- Redistricting turned once-safe Democratic districts into
competitive ones. The Democrats still hold a greater share of House
seats than is their share of the national vote for the House, but
Republicans believe the last round of redistricting helped to level
the playing field in many districts.
</P>
<P>
-- Republicans appear to be assembling a quasi-independent force of
grass-roots workers, including religious conservatives, anti-tax
activists and term-limits advocates, who could offset organized
labor's aid to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
That is why Democrats want people to believe their problems have
nothing to do with them. But the Oklahoma and Kentucky special
congressional elections showed that in some parts of the country,
particularly in Southern and border states, Clinton is a growing
liability to Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
In Oklahoma, the Democratic candidate kept his distance from
Clinton (and lost), and in Kentucky, Republican Ron Lewis wrapped
Clinton around Prather and, when Prather failed to fight back,
snatched away a seat that had been in Democratic hands for 129 years.
</P>
<P>
The lesson, expressed vigorously by Clinton and other top Democrats
after Prather's loss was: Fight back. They said Democrats who had run
from Clinton over the last year -- such as Prather and Virginia's Mary
Sue Terry and Texas's Bob Kreuger -- got beat.
</P>
<P>
And those who didn't? Well, they got beat too, but not so badly.
Exhibits A, B and C were former Georgia Sen. Wyche Fowler, former New
Jersey Gov. Jim Florio and former New York Mayor David N. Dinkins.
</P>
<P>
To this reasoning by Democrats, Republican National Committee
officials literally howled.
</P>
<P>
``I suggest Democrats in November take David's (DNC Chairman David
Wilhelm) advice and adopt a ... Jim Florio, David Dinkins strategy,''
RNC Chairman Haley Barbour said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
But there was a more serious point Clinton and Wilhelm tried to
make to their fellow Democrats. With the economy growing, inflation
low and the possibility of action on health care reform, the Democrats
may have a message of success to take to voters this fall.
</P>
<P>
When Republicans lost 26 seats in 1982, two years after Ronald
Reagan won the presidency in a landslide, unemployment had just hit 10
percent. This year it has been falling, and gross domestic product has
been rising. Interest rates? The Democrats will blame their increase
on Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
Democrats do not believe they have received enough credit from the
voters for that record. Whether because of Clinton's foreign policy
problems, the nagging questions about Whitewater and his personal life
that have eroded public confidence in his character or the
still-uncertain fate of health care, the Democrats have not been able
to sell themselves nationally.
</P>
<P>
Republicans are eager to see the fall elections turned into a
national referendum. They argue that perceptions of Clinton,
particularly in the South, have been shaped by controversy over
homosexuals in the military, by the belief that his health care plan
is a big-government approach and by the belief that his fiscal policy
is to tax first, cut spending later.
</P>
<P>
But presidential pollster Stanley Greenberg said the Republicans
may be overly confident in their belief that voters want to abandon
Clinton and the Democrats. ``There's denial that there was any
criticism of the '80s in the 1992 election,'' he said. ``The special
elections reinforce that denial and may mislead them in how '94 will
be defined and how '96 will be defined.''
</P>
<P>
Health care may hold the key to the Democrats' future. Successful
passage of a reform bill that ultimately guarantees coverage for all
Americans could cap Clinton's first two years in office and give
incumbents something real on which to campaign. Failure to pass
anything could, in turn, bring disgust with gridlock back to center
stage.

 India Withers in Near-Record Heat (New Delhi) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW DELHI, India
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even for India, notorious for heat and dust,
this summer has been a sizzler.
</P>
<P>
How hot has it been? On Monday, New Delhi sweated though its
hottest afternoon in a half-century, with the mercury shooting up to
114.8 degrees.
</P>
<P>
In the arid, mostly desert state of Rajasthan to the southwest of
the Indian capital, at least 71 people have died over the past few
days of heat stroke, news reports said. In the towns of Phalodi and
Jhalawar, it was an overpowering 118.4 degrees. Dust storms were
forecast for some areas.
</P>
<P>
Rajasthan's chief minister, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, said more than
22,000 villages were in the grip of a severe drought caused by the
two-week heat wave. The state will spend almost $65 million on aid and
make-work programs for farmers whose crops have been singed in the
fields, he said.
</P>
<P>
New Delhi's wide streets were deserted during much of the day as
wary residents avoided the burning sun and searing breezes that felt
as if they were venting from a brick kiln. Electric current ebbed and
surged throughout the day, sometimes failing entirely, as the already
overtaxed power grid strained to run all the air conditioners and fans
in this city of more than 8 million people.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Like the British before them, many of India's high and mighty fled
the burning plains of northern India for the cooler hills. On a single
day recently, 10 government VIPs were sighted in Dehra Dun, ostensibly
on some official business.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Manmohan Singh went to unveil a statue of Buddha
at a hospital. Rajesh Pilot, minister of state for external security,
was chief guest at a function staged by the Indo-Tibetan border
police. Pressed by a reporter, he admitted he intended to relax in the
coolness of the nearby hill station of Mussoorie for four days.
</P>
<P>
For those left behind at lower altitudes, no relief was in sight,
forecasters warned. Ram Snehi, director of the Safdarjung
Meteorological Office in the capital, said Monday that over the next
few days ``the maximum temperature may, at the most, show a difference
of about a half a degree only, but no dramatic change is expected.''
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
May is generally the hottest month of the year for Delhi. The
weatherman's outlook was bad news for people across North India, who
must expect another month of intense heat before the arrival of the
cooling rains of the monsoon, expected to reach Delhi June 29.
</P>
<P>
May 29, 1944 remains the hottest day on record in India's capital,
with the temperature peaking at 117 degrees.

 Disks Cheaper by the Megabyte (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You hit the ``enter'' or ``return'' key and that soft,
comforting clicking begins. A colored light blinks on and off. Your
hard disk, working faster than a waiter at a wedding banquet, is
serving information by the millions of bits.
</P>
<P>
We hear endlessly of rapid-fire advances in microprocessors. But
just as important in keeping personal computing on that ever-upward
plane are faster, cheaper, higher-capacity hard disks. And their gains
are just as amazing.
</P>
<P>
Don't think so? Consider these numbers.
</P>
<P>
In a little more than a decade storage costs have been cut by close
to 99 percent. That is, in 1982, according to research firm Dataquest
Inc., the price of hard disks worked out at about $75 per megabyte (1
million characters) of data. On average, hard disks sold back then
could hold a mere 6 megabytes of information.
</P>
<P>
But in 1993, the price of hard disks worked out to 92 cents per
megabyte. The average disk size was 240 megabytes. That's progress.
</P>
<P>
So, look at it like this way: the Windows revolution and the advent
of multimedia computing happened because companies have built hard
disks big enough to hold the bloated software that these innovations
require. The disk makers have names like Quantum Corp., Seagate
Technology Inc., Connor Peripherals Inc. and International Business
Machines Corp. They are huge operations; they sold about $9 billion
worth of hard disks for PCs and laptops in 1993, according to
International Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
But few consumers know their names (with the exception, of course,
of IBM). That's because most of these companies' production is
overseas, typically in Singapore or Malaysia. It also is because most
people don't know what kind of hard disks they have -- it just comes as
part of the computer.
</P>
<P>
The hard disk is a holdout in the computer world -- it's among the
last components with moving parts. Its interior would warm the heart
of a Swiss watchmaker. It is a miniature world of metal and motion -- 
discs that spin, heads that move back and forth in jerky robot -- like
motion to fetch data and electric motors that keep the whole unit
alive.
</P>
<P>
When a hard disk fails, it is usually more painful than anything
else that can go wrong with your computer system. You can replace all
other components quickly and go on as before. But a failed hard disk
can destroy years of information. (Don't forget to make those
backups!)
</P>
<P>
But mostly what hard disks do is sell, not fail. The market is so
vibrant that it has been unfazed by a potentially troubling
development: the appearance of compression software. It used to be the
only way to get bigger capacity was to buy a bigger disk. Now
companies such as Microsoft Corp. and Stac Electronics Inc. have sold
millions of copies of software that shrinks the size of other software
and data files, meaning you can get more onto the old disk.
</P>
<P>
But Crawford Del Prete of International Data Corp. says compression
is being used mainly in laptops, where it's hard to upgrade the disk.
On easy-to-upgrade desktops, he said, prices are low enough so
``people are willing to spend and upgrade'' the old way, by buying a
new disk.
</P>
<P>
How long will the hard disk remain? You can count on a long, long
time. While there are two major competing technologies, the CD-ROM and
what's called ``flash memory,'' each has drawbacks that make it
unsuitable as the disk's successor.
</P>
<P>
The CD-ROM, which has become commonplace these days, makes a
wonderful storage medium, holding about 650 megabytes of information.
But access time is much slower than with hard disks (that file your
hard disk can fetch in one second may take a CD-ROM five or 10
seconds).
</P>
<P>
Plus there's the lack of erasability. CD-ROMs, as we know them
today, can't record once they've left the factory. There are erasable
optical units out there, but they are two and three times the price of
hard disks. And even if costs came down, there is still the problem of
slow access time.
</P>
<P>
Flash memory is the other alternative. This is a memory chip that
can store any information you want and, unlike its Random Access
Memory cousins that hold data electronically in your computer, doesn't
forget everything when the machine is turned off. Ideally, it would
make a wonderful replacement -- low power, small size, an end to those
darned moving parts.
</P>
<P>
Ideally, I said. Flash memory has found a fast-growing market in
such things as PCMCIA cards used in laptops and personal digital
assistants. Prices are coming down by about 50 percent a year. But the
technology remains far too expensive for general desktop use.
Dataquest figures that flash sold in one megabyte dollops is about
where hard disks were a decade ago -- $75 per megabyte.
</P>
<P>
So, it would not generally make sense to store a 20-megabyte
Windows program in flash when you could do the job for about
one-fiftieth the cost with a hard disk.
</P>
<P>
Consider, too, that hard-disk makers have hardly come to a
standstill in product improvement. Manufacturers are shrinking the
size and raising the durability of hard disks to the point that
popping them into mobile devices makes more sense all the time.
</P>
<P>
And the basic, full-sized product is always getting stronger. Each
year, engineers make progress on two basic challenges: One, building
recording heads that are faster and more sensitive and, therefore, can
inscribe more information on a smaller piece of ``real estate'' on a
disk; two, developing materials that can hold information at denser
ratios.
</P>
<P>
The other force that is bringing prices down is economies of scale.
Even without technological advance, prices would probably fall as more
and more computers are sold. Annual world demand for desktop drives is
about 50 million units, up from basically nothing in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Phil Devin, Dataquest's disk specialist, expects that storage costs
will fall from 1993's 92 cents per megabyte to 9 cents by 1998.
Imagine that. Or wait and see it for real. It's only four years away.

 Shot Fired at Hosokawa (Tokyo) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A right-wing nationalist Monday fired a single gunshot near
former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in a hotel lobby. He was
unhurt.
</P>
<P>
Police and members of Japan's secret service arrested the
assailant. Press reports said he told police he was angry at
Hosokawa's apologies last year for Japan's aggression in World War II,
and at Hosokawa's inability to end Japan's long-running recession.
</P>
<P>
The assailant was identified as Masakatsu Nozoe, 52, said to be a
member of a nationalist fringe group that maintains Japan was in the
right when it invaded East Asian countries and attacked Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
As Hosokawa walked through the hotel lobby after a political rally,
Nozoe fired a single shot from about 30 feet away, witnesses said. The
bullet hit the ceiling. Nozoe reportedly told police later that he had
not intended to shoot Hosokawa.
</P>
<P>
For many Japanese, Hosokawa is the epitome of change here. Last
summer, he was a leader of the political revolution that ended four
decades of one-party conservative rule.
</P>
<P>
Hosokawa's successor, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, has basically
taken the same stance on apologies for the war. But he gave in to
right-wing pressure earlier this month when he canceled plans,
originally made by Hosokawa, to have Emperor Akihito visit the Pearl
Harbor Memorial in Honolulu during a trip to the United States in
June.

 Somalia Talks Postponed Again (Nairobi)

NAIROBI, Kenya
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Somalia's on-again, off-again peace talks were
once again postponed after the main feuding parties failed to show up.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said this latest delay, prior to a U.N. Security Council
decision on the future of the operation, appeared to increase the
likelihood that the Clinton administration would prevail in its
attempts to cut it short. The ``nation-building'' has cost $1.5
billion so far but yielded few results.
</P>
<P>
``Of course, it looks bad,'' said a senior U.N. diplomat here
speaking of this latest postponement. The talks, originally scheduled
for April but postponed four times, were supposed to prepare a
full-fledged national reconciliation conference to choose a new
government.
</P>
<P>
Somalia has been without any government since dictator Mohamed Siad
Barre was overthrown in January 1991 and the country descended into
anarchy. Diplomats had called these talks the Somali factional
leaders' last chance to reach a compromise and set up a government
before the Security Council voted to shorten the mandate of the U.N.
mission to just six more weeks. But antagonists Ali Mahdi Mohamed, the
country's self-styled ``interim president,'' and Gen. Mohamed Farah
Aideed, the strongman of South Mogadishu, did not show up.

 U.S. Ready to Indict Rostenkowski (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal prosecutors plan to seek an indictment Tuesday
against House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski,
D-Ill., unless he makes a last minute offer for a plea agreement,
sources familiar with the case said Monday.
</P>
<P>
By Monday afternoon, Rostenkowski still had not accepted a deal and
sources said that -- barring an immediate overture by the influential
lawmaker -- the waiting was over.
</P>
<P>
``The government is ready to go,'' one source familiar with the
negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
Other sources said that the government's case was already set for
presentation to a grand jury. Tuesday is the ``day'' another source
said.
</P>
<P>
After more than two weeks of discussing the possibility of a plea
bargain, Rostenkowski last week declined to accept a deal in which he
would plead guilty to a felony and spend a limited amount of time in
jail, sources said. U.S. Attorney Eric H. Holder Jr. gave Rostenkowski
until over the holiday weekend to ponder his fate.
</P>
<P>
Options for Rostenkowski appear to have run out, as has his tenure
as chairman of Ways and Means, a committee that puts him in the
forefront on President Clinton's health-care legislation as well as
major trade, welfare and tax bills.
</P>
<P>
If the grand jury returns an indictment punishable by at least two
years in prison, under normal procedures of the House Democratic
Caucus, Rostenkowski would have to step down from the committee
chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
A plea bargain would give him a slight chance of retaining his
chairmanship. Caucus rules do not require a member convicted of
criminal charges to resign from office or leadership positions,
although such members are likely to face an ethics investigation and
disciplinary actions. House Republicans have indicated that they would
seek to have Rostenkowski removed from the chairmanship if a plea
agreement is struck.
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors have outlined a broad case against Rostenkowski
of conspiracy to defraud the government in what has been described as
``kitchen sink'' approach alleging abuses of official accounts for
postage, leased automobiles, office space, supplies and personnel.
Rostenkowski has publicly denied all the allegations.
</P>
<P>
The FBI has investigated whether several so-called ``ghost
employees'' in Rostenkowski's Chicago office received pay for work
never down. The probe also examined whether Rostenkowski purchased
personal and gift items through his expense account at the House
Stationary Store. In addition, the prosecution's case also reportedly
examines whether government leased cars were used primarily for
personal use rather than official business and if Rostenkowski and
other lawmakers traded postage vouchers and stamps for thousands of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski, completing his 36th year in Congress, entered plea
discussions in an effort to reduce or eliminate any prison sentence
while avoiding a lengthy legal battle. He also wanted to try to retain
his chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
The talks broke down as the government remained adamant that
Rostenkowski must do jail time and plead guilty to a felony that is
reflective of the breadth of the overall allegations against him.
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski is said to be frustrated that the government's case
originates from the initial investigation into the so-called House
Post Office scam. He views those initial allegations as bogus and
generally believes that the subsequent questions of wrongdoing are
petty.
</P>
<P>
Should he be indicted, the stage will be set for one of the more
acrimonious and lengthy legal battles in recent memory, said sources,
including one who described the resulting litigation in terms of
``nuclear war.''

 Palestinian Authority Gets Off to Rocky Start (Jericho) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
JERICHO, West Bank
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Palestinian official, just arrived with the
new police force from Jordan, waxed eloquent on the telephone last
week to his wife back home about life in Jericho.
</P>
<P>
``It's like heaven,'' gushed Abu Yassin. ``Psychologically, it is
poetry to be in my homeland.
</P>
<P>
``But we are living in hell,'' he admitted to her. ``The weather is
very bad. There is no bed -- I sleep on the floor. And to eat, I have
to go out to pick fruit from the banana fields.''
</P>
<P>
Such is the mix of emotions and complications that has marked the
start of Palestinian autonomy in Jericho and the Gaza Strip. The first
10 days after Israeli withdrawal have served up a salad of close
calls, doomsday predictions, angry threats and cautious whiffs of
optimism.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian autonomy has gotten off to a predictably rocky start.
There is little sign so far of a Palestinian government to replace the
civil administration that left with the Israeli army.
</P>
<P>
The last Israeli paycheck to civil servants here runs out Tuesday,
and no one has stepped in to pick up the payroll. Palestinian
soldiers-turned-police still are trickling in from scattered bases in
the Middle East, but they have no supplies and little equipment.
</P>
<P>
They have to borrow gas from Israel to put in their patrol jeeps,
donated from the United States. Officers declared it unseemly for
their men to take handouts of food from local residents, but they had
no other provisions. The Israeli army started slipping combat rations
to the new arrivals.
</P>
<P>
Yasser Arafat was still in Tunis, Tunisia, trying to appoint a
national council. Other Palestinian figures balked at joining him and
sharing blame for the mess.
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, it is Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin who finds
cheer amid this gloom.
</P>
<P>
It is ``a good start ... a good chance for the future,'' he said
last week on a tour of the Gaza Strip. ``Things were carried out in a
much better way than I thought.
</P>
<P>
``I had deep fears about ... the way things would take shape,'' he
said. But ``on the Palestinian side, a real effort was made to
coordinate and understand.''
</P>
<P>
The prime minister may have been practicing a little damage
control. Public opinion polls showed a sharp dive in Israeli support
last week for continuing the five-year autonomy process; 63 percent
said stop now, according to one poll.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Israeli newspapers worked themselves into a froth over the first
mishaps involving Palestinian police. Last Monday, a Palestinian
soldier shot out the tires of an Israeli who ignored a checkpoint. On
Tuesday, the new officers improperly arrested three armed Israelis. On
Wednesday, a Palestinian private stopped at gunpoint an Israeli
general. News photos showed Israeli and Palestinian soldiers faced off
with guns, a hair-trigger away from disaster.
</P>
<P>
But the disaster did not happen. Nor did other dire predictions
that autonomy would bring civil war among Palestinian factions, or a
revolt in other areas, or a slew of fresh terrorist incidents. In all,
last week, things were relatively quiet.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
In a background briefing to Israeli reporters, top Israeli army
chiefs went out of their way to compliment the Palestinian police.
</P>
<P>
The crisp-uniformed Palestinians look smarter than the determinedly
sloppy Israeli soldiers, admitted a senior Israeli officer. And ``when
an Israeli brigade replaces another, it is much less organized than
what we have seen so far from the Palestinians,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
But flattery and understanding could not hide obvious shortcomings
in the Palestinian takeover. Although they have had eight months to
plan their transition, the Palestinians have arrived with no mechanism
to continue government services.
</P>
<P>
Israel's civil administration said that it spent about $70 million
a year on government services to the Gaza Strip and Jericho. With the
additional cost of police salaries, the Palestinians may need three
times that amount.
</P>
<P>
``The Palestinian national authority is in financial straits,''
lamented the Arabic daily Al-Quds . ``Before the end of this month it
has to have $20 million in Gaza and Jericho.''
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians protest that international donors so far are
deadbeats and have not backed up their pledges with cash. In part, the
donor countries are wary of handing over money to the historically
corrupt PLO; in part they prefer financing concrete projects over
daily expense vouchers.
</P>
<P>
``They are insisting on specific projects that they can put a
plaque on, praising the donors. There is no money for operating
expenses,'' acknowledged one Israeli official.
</P>
<P>
(Optional Add End)
</P>
<P>
The Israelis do not acknowledge any responsibility for the
situation. For 27 years, Israel silenced, imprisoned or deported
emerging leaders of the Palestinian people. As for facilities, Israel
this month left behind equipment ranging from computers to telephones
in some offices, but stripped others bare.
</P>
<P>
Israel, too, has been less than faithful to its signature,
Palestinians complain. Israel has released fewer than 1,000 of the
5,000 prisoners it had promised to free promptly after May 4.

 Pope Unequivocally Reasserts Ban on Women Priests (Vatican City) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
VATICAN CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a stern veto, Pope John Paul II reasserted a ban
against women priests Monday, ordering Catholics to end internal
debate and obey historic teachings.
</P>
<P>
In a righteous, authoritarian apostolic letter addressed to his
bishops, Pope John Paul marked his first day back in the office after
four weeks in a hospital for a broken leg.
</P>
<P>
His resounding ``no'' to any possibility of a greater religious
role for Catholic women in their church was the second time in a week
that the Vatican has crossed swords with assertive Catholic women.
Before returning to the Vatican Friday, Pope John Paul accepted an
English translation of the church's new catechism that women's groups
have denounced as sexist for its language.
</P>
<P>
Monday's 1,000-word letter, ``On Reserving Priestly Ordination To
Men Alone,'' is remarkable for its bluntness and the absolute
authority that Pope John Paul asserts ``in order that all doubt may be
removed regarding a matter of great importance.
</P>
<P>
``I declare that the Church has no authority whatsoever to confer
priestly ordination on women, and that this judgment is to be
definitively held for all the Church's faithful,'' Pope John Paul
writes in the letter.
</P>
<P>
Fundamentals of their faith make it impossible to ordain women as
priests, the pope tells his bishops, noting that Christ ``acted in a
completely free and sovereign manner'' in selecting only men as his
apostles -- the first priests. Still, Pope John Paul laments, despite
an all-male priesthood unbroken across two millennia, ``in some places
it is nonetheless considered open to debate.''
</P>
<P>
No more, in the pope's view. An accompanying Vatican commentary
said the letter ``confirms a certainty which has been constantly held
and lived by the church.'' As such, the pope's views are not to be
regarded as new, or an opinion, or a matter of discipline, ``but as
certainly true.''
</P>
<P>
``Therefore, since it does not belong to matters freely open to
dispute, it always requires the full and unconditional assent of the
faithful, and to teach the contrary is equivalent to leading
consciences into error,'' his commentary says.
</P>
<P>
Pope John Paul, 74, who has been increasingly outspoken in recent
months, will host a private meeting at the Vatican Thursday with
President Clinton, who may get a papal lecture for his support for
abortion.
</P>
<P>
In a debate the Vatican no longer wants to hear among Catholics,
advocates of women priests say Christ's choice of disciples was
determined by customs and laws of the time, not because he sought a
unisex ministry.
</P>
<P>
(Optional Add End)
</P>
<P>
Pope John Paul's vigorous restatement of the ban may have been
prompted in part by the ordination of the Church of England's first
women priests in March, an innovation that effectively scuttled
reunification talks between the two churches. Thousands of Anglicans
and hundreds of Anglican priests have turned to Catholicism. The
Vatican is accepting even married Anglican priests as converts -- and
priests -- despite its own ban on married priests.
</P>
<P>
Lobbying among Catholic activists for women priests has increased
since the Anglican ordinations, a Vatican official noted.
</P>
<P>
Pope John Paul has now fired an unanswerable broadside in response.
</P>
<P>
``The pope clearly intends for the ban to stick, because he comes
right up to the brink of infallibility with this teaching. Still, it
is not infallible, and therefore it is open to possible change by some
later pope,'' said one senior theologian.
</P>
<P>
Under Catholic dogma, popes are infallible in matters of faith and
morals when the say they are giving infallible teachings.

 Dictators Block Foreign-Policy Goals (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stubbornness of dictatorships has become one of
the Clinton administration's chief foreign-policy vexations.
</P>
<P>
Leaders in Haiti, China, and most recently North Korea, have found
a way to thumb their noses at top U.S. diplomatic priorities.
</P>
<P>
Haiti's corrupt military regime showed no sign last week of
buckling under to newly tightened U.S.-inspired economic sanctions
aimed at forcing the return of elected President Jean Bertrand
Aristide.
</P>
<P>
A clique of elderly Chinese generals and Communist Party bosses
successfully called Washington's bluff by ignoring the threat of new
tariffs on exports to the United States unless they improved their
human-rights record.
</P>
<P>
Then North Korea's communist regime on Friday appeared to rule out
critical international inspections of spent fuel rods at a nuclear
reactor north of its capital, giving every indication the country will
never allow the outside world to perform inspections needed to learn
how much plutonium it may have accumulated for nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
These dismal results of earnest U.S. diplomacy have not been
flattering to America's self-image as a world leader, and if President
Clinton's recent comments are any indication, they are provoking some
re-examination not only of his expectations for U.S. foreign policy
but also the administration's often blunt and demanding style of
dealing with recalcitrant foreign leaders.
</P>
<P>
As one senior U.S. official explained, when Clinton arrived at the
White House, he shared a popular notion that foreign relations is an
extension of domestic U.S. business relations -- a matter of rules and
regulations in which the threat to sue, or impose legal sanctions, is
a vital negotiating tool.
</P>
<P>
Clinton had criticized President George Bush for ``coddling
dictators,'' for example, and indicated he supported pursuing punitive
measures such as economic sanctions if other nations did not comply
with U.S. demands.
</P>
<P>
Recalling a statement by Dean Acheson that sanctions are
essentially a declaration of war without the willingness to use force,
the senior official said Clinton had a misplaced faith that they could
be used to alter other nations' internal priorities, without the
direct compulsion of a military attack.
</P>
<P>
``Sanctions did not get (General Manuel) Noriega out of Panama'' in
1989 and they did not force the Iraqi military to withdraw from Kuwait
in 1991, the official said, calling America's persistent faith in
sanctions ``pathetic.''
</P>
<P>
But several officials said the frustrating experience of the last
few months appears to have humbled the president's ambitions. At a
White House news conference on Thursday, Clinton not only rejected
future threats of higher tariffs on trade with China, he also
counseled a more patient style of diplomacy, noting that ``a great
society, so large and with such built-in habits, does not change
overnight.'' He compared the challenge of improving human rights there
to the reduction of ``crime and violence'' in U.S. society -- a goal
that would take years to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
Clinton had struck a similar theme of the limits of U.S. influence
in a May 25 speech to the U.S. Naval Academy's graduating class, where
he noted that many of the world's ``most tearing conflicts ... will
rarely submit to instant solutions.'' Noting that the resolution of
the Cold War took decades, he said ``we must often be willing to pay
the price of time, sometimes the most painful price of all.''
</P>
<P>
In addition to lowering expectations about quick results, Clinton
also seemed last week to be pointing the way to a less confrontational
style of diplomacy. Revealing what could be taken as a personal
epiphany of sorts about the limits of U.S. powers of moral suasion, he
said that ``no nation likes to feel that every decision it makes for
the good, to do something that's right, that makes progress, is being
made...only because of external pressure from someone else.''
</P>
<P>
Clinton was trying to explain why China had rebuffed Washington's
insistent entreaties to treat its people more like the United States
treats its citizens. But several U.S. officials said they believe the
lesson may also be relevant to Haiti and North Korea, which also have
repeatedly ignored urgings that they respect U.S.-defined ``norms'' of
international behavior.
</P>
<P>
The officials suggested that in both cases, Washington has backed
itself into a corner by using or threatening to use sanctions unlikely
to produce instant policy shifts. The officials said Clinton might
have understood the magnitude of the challenge earlier had he listened
to U.S. intelligence experts instead of the strains of popular opinion
supporting tough demands and blunt threats.
</P>
<P>
A number of classified studies reported last winter, for example,
that the Chinese leadership was beset by worry about growing internal
unrest, officials said. The studies also said key Chinese officials
were jockeying for power, anticipating the death of aged leader Deng
Xioaping, and would be unlikely to risk supporting any liberalization.
They also reported that Chinese leaders were not taking seriously
Washington's threat of higher trade tariffs -- even though the threat
was not lifted until last week.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. intelligence community report similarly predicted last fall
 -- correctly, it seems -- that North Korea would not accede to demands
for nuclear-related inspections that would reveal the size of its
stockpile of plutonium, a key ingredient of nuclear arms. Other U.S.
intelligence reports have expressed skepticism that the economic
embargo of Haiti would prompt its military rulers to resign soon.
</P>
<P>
In its dealings with both of these stubborn dictatorships, the
Clinton administration might soon be faced with the same choice it
faced last week with China: to continue to pursue a policy that has
not worked, or to face up to a further humbling of American
foreign-policy ambitions.

 Vladivostok Church Returns to the Fold (Vladivostok, Russia) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
VLADIVOSTOK, Russia
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sun was still high and the day was warm,
so by the time he reached the top step, the Rev. Myron Effing was
sweating and puffing.
</P>
<P>
He had taken visitors up some splintering outdoor wooden stairs, up
a hillside strewn with garbage and weeds, past flimsy lean-tos with
laundry billowing from clotheslines, and finally to a simple, solid
red-brick building overlooking a square.
</P>
<P>
``Here it is,'' said the 53-year-old Roman Catholic priest, a
little out of breath. ``It's our pride right now, our joy.''
</P>
<P>
The object of Effing's affection was a church with a history as
tragic and grim and, now, as full of hope as Russia's own history in
this century.
</P>
<P>
For 58 years, it was not a place of worship, but an archive of the
Soviet state. It was in the state's hands for so long that people
forgot it had ever been a church at all, and some bureaucrats even
disputed it, despite abundant evidence and explicit testimony to prove
it.
</P>
<P>
The Communists had built a radio tower to jam foreign broadcasts
atop a higher hill nearby, as if to remind those below that the
party's authority was loftier even than God's.
</P>
<P>
Then last New Year's Eve, after a two-year struggle, Effing
reclaimed the building from the government and proclaimed that the
Church of the Most Holy Mother of God -- and the Roman Catholic Church
 -- had returned to Vladivostok, at last. But as Effing knew better than
anyone, that meant the real work was only about to start.
</P>
<P>
It is the lone Catholic church in this boom town of 700,000 people,
and these days it is very much Effing's church -- his work in progress,
his personal crusade.
</P>
<P>
A native of Indiana, Effing had spent much of his adult life
teaching in seminaries in the American Midwest and recruiting young
men for the priesthood. In 1986, he went to Guam and spent four years
there as rector of a seminary. He returned to the United States in
1990 as a university chaplain in California, but before long, he said,
he grew tired of church politics there.
</P>
<P>
His aim was to find a place where there were no other priests, and
Russia seemed like ideal virgin territory. He appealed to the bishop
of Novosibirsk in western Siberia -- the nearest diocesan seat to
Vladivostok, though it is four time zones away. The bishop had no idea
whether any Catholic church had ever existed in Vladivostok but told
Effing to go ahead and see whether a parish could be organized there.
</P>
<P>
At the time, Vladivostok was still a closed military city, barred
not only to foreigners but also to Russians who lacked special
permission to enter. On an invitation from the city, Effing arrived in
1991 and discovered there had indeed once been a parish and a church.
Rebuilding them would become his vocation.
</P>
<P>
``When we first came we didn't have anything except our suitcases
and a computer,'' he said. ``We had to borrow the money to buy our
plane tickets from San Francisco. ... When I first saw the church I
felt mostly pity because it was in such a rundown condition. And I
felt pity that such a strong Catholic community in the past could
build such a good building only to have everything taken away.''
</P>
<P>
The building he found had been finished, or nearly finished, in a
rush in 1922 as the Bolsheviks, on their way to victory in Russia's
Civil War, approached Vladivostok. It was a cathedral, the seat of a
diocese, but architecturally it was hardly distinct from countless
red-brick churches built in cities in America's eastern seaboard about
the same time. Yet the panoramic setting, high above the city
overlooking Golden Horn Bay and its bustling harbor, was magnificent.
</P>
<P>
The supression of the church began soon after the Bolsheviks
arrived. The parish, which included 5,000 Catholics in the city and
10,000 more in the surrounding Maritime Territory of Russia's Far
East, soon began to dwindle as priests and lay people left or were
expelled or killed.
</P>
<P>
When the atheistic Communists finally confiscated the church in
1935, as they had confiscated everything else, the explanation was as
simple as it was laughable: There were no more Catholics around, so
who needed a church?
</P>
<P>
Inside the structure, they built three floors where before there
had been soaring space and stained-glass windows, and they stacked
shelves with documents and books. The altar, the crucifix, the pews
and everything else from the interior were removed.
</P>
<P>
This was how Effing found it when he arrived 2 1/2 years ago. He
set about persuading city officials that the building should be
returned to the Catholic Church. He collected affidavits from old
people who remembered that the building had been built with private
funds.
</P>
<P>
Effing found a marble crucifix that had been dug up 20 years
earlier near the church by a crew laying a cable and reclaimed it to
use in a shrine commemorating martyrs of the parish. Workmen began
digging to see whether anything else that might once have belonged to
the church still lay underground.
</P>
<P>
Last November, the parish celebrated its first Mass on the top
floor inside the church, and on Dec. 31 Effing was formally presented
with the keys to the building -- a place of worship at last for his 250
parishioners.
</P>
<P>
On Sundays he says Mass in Russian, then preaches in English, using
a translator. A few months ago he conducted his first full-fledged
wedding, a young American man marrying a Russian. An older couple who
had been married for decades also came to have their union blessed in
the church.
</P>
<P>
Effing now wants to restore the church to its original condition, a
task made more difficult since the plans for the interior have
disappeared. The cost of repairing the church is astronomical -- 
$700,000 to shore up the crumbling facade alone, Effing reckons. The
nearest pipe organ he knows of is in Irkutsk, Siberia, 1,500 miles to
the west. And he expects that his goal to reclaim land around the
church will turn into a new fight with city authorities.
</P>
<P>
But Effing said he has decided that rebuilding the church, and
Vladivostok's Catholic community, will be his life's remaining work.

 `Flintstones' Leaves the Rest in Its Dust (Hollywood) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
HOLLYWOOD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What do you call $37.5 million in the box-office till?
</P>
<P>
Certainly not pebbles.
</P>
<P>
Hollywood on Monday was calling the Memorial Day weekend gross for
Universal Pictures' ``The Flintstones'' something ``wonderful'' and a
``great start for the summer.''
</P>
<P>
Starring John Goodman as Fred Flintstone, the live-action version
of the Hanna-Barbera animated TV series that was a hit in the 1960s,
established a record -- ticket-price inflation notwithstanding -- for a
Memorial Day weekend opening, based on preliminary estimates. It
surpassed the $37 million taken in by Paramount Pictures' sequel
``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' in 1989, when ticket prices
were somewhat lower. Both films are associated with Steven Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
``The Flintstones'' also helped propel ticket sales for the overall
movie business approximately 10 percent ahead of last year's Memorial
Day weekend, which is the traditional beginning to the summer season.
Hollywood invests heavily in summer fare from which it hopes to derive
40 percent of an entire year's box-office receipts.
</P>
<P>
``After weeks of a springtime box-office slump, this certainly
bodes well,'' said John Krier of Exhibitor Relations Co., who noted
that there are ``many big titles to come,'' including Walt Disney's
animated ``The Lion King,'' which industry insiders have picked as
this summer's expected box-office champ. It opens June 15.
</P>
<P>
``The Flintstones'' was launched with a massive marketing campaign
 -- notably a tie-in to McDonald's restaurants -- but to mixed reactions
from the critics who thought the audience for the movie would be
children.
</P>
<P>
``A lot of people thought this movie wasn't going to work, or that
it would be only for kids,'' said Universal Pictures chairman Tom
Pollock, whose studio released last summer's ``Jurassic Park''
(another Spielberg picture and the industry's all-time box-office
champ). ``But when you have a Friday night where families comprise
only about half the business, it means that the other half are adults
and teens on dates.''
</P>
<P>
It also meant that about 40 percent of the weekend audience headed
directly to ``The Flintstones' '' hometown of Bedrock, and it might
appear that the stampede left other films in the proverbial dust. But
not quite.
</P>
<P>
``Maverick,'' another remake of an old TV show with Mel Gibson as a
card shark of the Old West and a cast that also bills Jodie Foster and
James Garner, delivered an estimated big $18 million in the
Friday-through-Monday period. That brought the total for the Warner
Bros. release after two weekends of national release to just over $40
million.
</P>
<P>
Paramount Pictures' ``Beverly Hills Cop III'' drew an estimated
$15.5 million in its debut. The film is the third in the series
starring Eddie Murphy as a Detroit cop who finds adventures in Beverly
Hills.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
For Murphy, the opening was the strongest of his last three movies.
His film ``Boomerang'' opened on a peak summer weekend in 1992 to
$13.6 million. ``The Distinguished Gentleman'' scored $10.5 million in
its first weekend during the Christmas season in December 1992.
</P>
<P>
The box-office figures released Monday were based on industry
estimates for Friday through Monday. Final results will be released
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In fourth place was the Andy Garcia-Meg Ryan alcoholism drama
``When a Man Loves a Woman'' with $7.1 million, followed by the late
Brandon Lee and ``The Crow'' in fifth with $6.3 million and ``Four
Weddings and a Funeral'' in sixth with $2.7 million, estimates show.
</P>
<P>
Spike Lee's ``Crooklyn'' finished seventh with $1.6 million, while
``With Honors'' was eighth with $1.4 million. ``Little Buddha'' was
ninth with $834,000 and ``3 Ninjas Kick Back'' was 10th with $745,000.

 Suspected Right-Wing Extremist Shoots at Japanese Leader (Tokyo) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A suspected right-wing extremist fired a shot yards away
from former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa Monday in apparent
protest over Hosokowa's open apologies for Japan's actions in World
War II.
</P>
<P>
Hosokawa was not harmed. The bullet hit the ceiling of a Tokyo
hotel, where he had spoke at a political party meeting.
</P>
<P>
Security guards quickly tackled the gunman, who was identified as
Masakatsu Nozoe, 52. He later told police that he was upset by
Hosokawa's statements on Japan's role during World War II and his
economic policies, Japanese news reports said.
</P>
<P>
Police refused to confirm those reports, but they said Nozoe was
believed to be a member of an extremist right-wing group and that the
shooting may have been politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after his election last summer, Hosokawa became the first
Japanese prime minister to candidly state that Japan had waged a war
of aggression during the 1930s and 1940s. He offered apologies on
behalf of Japan for the consequent suffering and encouraged
revelations about suspected atrocities.
</P>
<P>
The comments were widely applauded throughout Asia and broadly
endorsed even in Japan. But they were deeply resented by a small
fringe of ultra-nationalists, commonly referred to as the country's
right wing, who believe the expansionist policies in China and
Southeast Asia were proper and the attack on Pearl Harbor a justified
pre-emptive strike against the United States.
</P>
<P>
Since Hosokawa's resignation last month in the midst of government
gridlock and allegations of financial improprieties, the
forthrightness that marked his tenure has receded.
</P>
<P>
A June trip by Japanese Emperor Akihito to the United States had
included a stop at Pearl Harbor, planned by the Hosokawa
administration. That has been canceled by the administration of
Hosokawa's successor, Tsutomu Hata. which has already been far less
adamantly forthright about Japan's past provocations.
</P>
<P>
Japan has hundreds of right-wing groups that make no apologies for
the nation's militant past. They advance their views by driving around
in vans with speakers, but they do not have a wide following and
generally have been nonviolent.
</P>
<P>
Since late last year, however, that appears to have changed. The
liberal Asahi Newspaper has been attacked several times recently,
including an incident last month when hostages were taken and held for
several hours. In the fall, a Japanese right-wing leader in the same
group committed suicide while visiting the Asahi, using handguns.
</P>
<P>
That incident and Monday's raise strong questions about Japan's
vaunted control of firearms. It is commonly thought that the major
crime syndicates have amble supplies, but it is rare that they are
used against outsiders.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Flush with confidence, the local police have been slowly reducing
security for former prime ministers, in some cases eliminating it
altogether -- but not for Hosokawa.
</P>
<P>
According to sources quoted by the Kyodo wire service, threats
against Hosokawa have been made since last summer by right-wing
groups.
</P>
<P>
Police official Kiyotaka Osaki said the shot was fired from about
10 yards away from Hosokawa. ``I'm just glad no one was injured,''
Hosokawa said after the attack. He declined to comment on the gunman's
possible motive.
</P>
<P>
Japan's wartime past has been been the focus of national attention
recently because of remarks by a Cabinet minister that Japanese
atrocities in Nanking, China's wartime capital, in 1937 were
exaggerated. The remarks ignited a storm of protest in Asia and the
official was forced to resign.

 Palestinian Authority Faces Monetary Crisis (Jericho) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
JERICHO, West Bank
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not even a month old, the Palestinian
Authority is facing a crisis that could bring its collapse -- an acute
shortage of cash.
</P>
<P>
Although promised $2.4 billion for economic development over five
years, the new Palestinian administration has virtually no funds with
which to operate -- no money to pay its police and civil servants, no
money to maintain local hospitals, trash collection and other public
services, no money for its own telephones and office lights.
</P>
<P>
``The situation is very, very serious,'' said Saeb Erekat, the
authority council member for local government. ``Our institutions are
brand new, and they need money to operate and meet the people's needs.
Without money, they won't function. The whole effort could fail for
the lack of start-up funds.''
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leaders fear that public support for the self-governing
authority, which already is controversial as a product of many
difficult compromises with Israel, will decline rapidly if it falters
in any way; thus, inability to pay its workers, maintain public
services and expand the economy could lead to a loss of legitimacy and
perhaps rebellion.
</P>
<P>
Freih Abu Meddein, a Gaza Strip lawyer with responsibility for
justice on the authority council, warns of possible food riots in Gaza
if the new administration does not receive enough assistance to begin
full operations and to launch its initial development programs.
</P>
<P>
``We had many promises that we would get the money as soon as we
signed the Cairo agreement on autonomy,'' Abu Meddein said in Gaza
City. ``It has been nearly four weeks, and we have received only a
fraction of our immediate and most urgent needs.''
</P>
<P>
The crisis is so serious that Israel Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
is looking at ways to assist the Palestinians, perhaps by continuing a
public works program that employs 16,000 in the Gaza Strip, perhaps by
lending the Palestinian Authority some of the operating funds it will
need for June. ``I am worried because, if it will not work, it will
not take more than three months ... until there will be no food,''
Rabin said over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Senior Israeli officials have sketched alarming scenarios of
possible riots, bloodshed and even civil war for the impoverished Gaza
Strip, home to more than 850,000 Palestinians, if the new authority
does not establish itself fast and effectively -- with the money to
back it up.
</P>
<P>
Amid the mounting concern, Faisal Husseini, a senior Palestinian
Authority member, sought to assure the Palestinian police and civil
servants Monday that they would be paid in June.
</P>
<P>
``The money's there,'' he told a news conference in Jerusalem,
alluding to a $19 million emergency fund.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials estimate the Palestinian Authority will need $600
million to $700 million a year to administer the Gaza Strip and the
West Bank; the Palestinian police force alone will cost about $105
million. Local revenues may come to only $200 million to $300 million,
depending on local tax rates.
</P>
<P>
The development program, starting with the 27-year backlog of
public works but reaching well beyond to the industrialization of some
regions and the the rehabilitation of agriculture in others, will cost
at least as much on an annual basis, Palestinian economists say. The
World Bank says that international pledges for the first year of
self-rule total $720 million.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
The money has been slow in coming for these reasons:
</P>
<P>
-- Western donors, mistrustful of Arafat, his secretive ways and past
profligacy, have insisted on full accountability of how their money is
spent. Arafat, wanting to ensure his own control of the funds, was
slow in staffing the Palestinian Economic Council, approving its
bylaws and appointing a Western investment bank, Morgan Stanley Asset
Management, to oversee it.
</P>
<P>
-- Many Western governments prefer to finance specific projects -- and
to give contracts to their own companies, thus boosting their exports,
as well as providing foreign aid. This has led to a proliferation of
proposals to PLO headquarters in Tunis for projects such as the
construction of airports, offshore generation of electricity and a new
telephone system, while immediate needs have been ignored.
</P>
<P>
-- The Palestinian Authority's own tax collections will probably not
start for months. A new tax system must be adopted to replace the one
imposed by the Israeli army during its occupation; the new
administration would like to lower the burden carried by local
businessmen to foster an economic resurgence.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Erekat said he hoped the Western countries that pledged extensive
economic assistance and development advice last September when Israel
and the PLO signed the autonomy agree will now free substantial
amounts to underwrite the authority's operations.
</P>
<P>
``We were born without a penny, and we are told that our ability to
cope will test our readiness to govern ourselves,'' Erekat said
bitterly. ``In a sense, this is right -- if we can run Gaza and Jericho
without cash, we are miracle workers.
</P>
<P>
``Instead of real help, we are getting one delegation of experts
after another, flying in first-class and business-class from around
the world, spending money on hotels and meals that we could use to pay
salaries, and then telling us they will make a recommendation after
the summer,'' he said.

 Non-Aligned Nations' Focus Shifts to Economic Issues (Cairo) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
CAIRO, Egypt
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The world seemed to be sliding inexorably toward
violent confrontation, if not nuclear disaster, that day in 1961 when
the leaders of Egypt, Yugoslavia and India declared themselves
officially out of the running of the Cold War, laying the groundwork
for a network of nations that would be neither of the East nor the
West.
</P>
<P>
The Berlin Crisis threatened superpower confrontation in the middle
of Europe; an ill-fated U.S.-backed attempt to topple the Marxist
regime in Cuba foundered near America's southern shores; disputes
broke out over nuclear testing around the globe; superpowers still
extended their military and colonial influence in large areas of
Africa and Asia.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, the Non-Aligned Movement created by Yugoslavian leader
Josip Tito, Egyptian President Gamal Abdul Nasser and Indian Prime
Minister Jawharlal Nehru convenes here for its 11th Council of
Ministers in a dramatically changed world.
</P>
<P>
Not only is there no longer any East-West axis with which to be
non-aligned, Yugoslavia, host of the first meeting of the Non-Aligned
Movement in Belgrade, has for the first time been refused an
invitation.
</P>
<P>
The new world's confrontations are erupting along religious and
nationalistic frontiers, and the new Yugoslavia will find itself
competing for a chance to debate foreign ministers of break-away
Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina over an appropriate response to the
long-running Balkan civil war.
</P>
<P>
Iran, embroiled in mounting disputes with the Arab world over its
support of Islamic fundamentalist militants, will send its foreign
minister to Cairo for the first time since the 1979 Islamic revolution
in Iran.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, one of whose first actions as a new
black-majority-led government was to join the Non-Aligned Movement,
will sit at the table with nations that spent decades reviling
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
For the 108 disenfranchised, non-aligned countries that represent
two-thirds of the world's people, the battles this week are more
likely to shape up over trade policy than national liberation -- the
widely loathed GATT agreement, economic relief for debt-ridden nations
and access for Third World goods to the world's major markets.
</P>
<P>
``There is really a different agenda coming. Well over half of the
active members are concerned about getting northern markets open to
their products. They're concerned about being shut out. They're
concerned about changing the terms of credit,'' said Tim Sullivan, a
political analyst who has studied the Non-Aligned Movement.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has pushed since the last summit of movement leaders in
Jakarta in 1992 to merge the Non-Aligned Movement with the Group of 77
developing nations, effectively undercutting its political role and
focusing squarely on the economic frontier between developed countries
and the Third World.
</P>
<P>
``When you consider the new economic realities of the world, it is
important to try to identify certain commercial interests and
formulate government positions which put us in a better negotiating
position when dealing with the West or developed countries,'' said
Nagui Ghatrify, foreign ministry spokesman for Egypt, which for years
capitalized on its non-aligned status by playing off the Soviet Union
against the United States.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Officials of the non-aligned movement say the political crises that
have been bungled or ignored by the world's superpowers -- the chaos in
Rwanda, Somalia and Liberia -- can perhaps best be addressed closer to
home.
</P>
<P>
Several nations at this week's meeting propose to discuss a new
peacemaking and peacekeeping role for non-aligned nations, similar to
plans under discussion by the Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
Non-aligned nations also are almost certain to continue the push
for a greater voice for the Third World in the United Nations, with
the most popular proposal being a permanent seat on the Security
Council for a developing regional power such as Egypt, Brazil or
India.

 Clinton Remembers U.S.' War Dead at Arlington Cemetery (Arlington) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ARLINGTON, Va.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the cusp of the 50th anniversary of D-day,
President Clinton remembered America's war dead Monday as ``the
backbone that secured our nation's liberty'' as thousands gathered at
Arlington National Cemetery to pay homage to the fallen.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a throng of veterans, families and friends, Clinton said
``it was the independence and the can-do confidence of the sons and
daughters of American and the other democracies that won the day'' on
June 6, 1944, when allied soldiers stormed the beaches of northern
France and lay the foundation for Adolph Hitler's defeat.
</P>
<P>
The president leaves Wednesday for an eight-day trip to Italy,
France and Britain, his first visit to those countries since taking
office. A highlight will be ceremonies to commemorate D-day's golden
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 Allied soldiers were slain or wounded in the
Normandy landing, which Clinton said started a battle that ``was not
just between two armies. It was as clearly as any conflict in all of
human history a battle between two ways of life.''
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he mourned the suicide earlier this month of Lewis
Puller Jr., a disabled Vietnam War veteran who wrote a Pulitzer-Prize
winning book after returning from the conflict. Puller was the son of
the most decorated Marine in history.
</P>
<P>
``This morning when I got up I thought of Lew Puller and the
countless other heroes he has joined and the terrible sacrifices men
and women have been willing to make for this great land,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
He laid a red-white-and-blue-flowered wreath at the Tomb of the
Unknowns at the cemetery earlier in the day. The president also hosted
a White House breakfast for veterans, telling them the nation must be
vigilant in fighting to uphold its freedoms.
</P>
<P>
``We owe our liberty and prosperity to the strength and valor of
those who fought'' in World War II, he told the veterans. ``But we
also inherit the responsibility of defending that gift.''
</P>
<P>
Clinton's Arlington Cemetery speech was greeted with warm applause
from the 4,000 people packed into an open-air amphitheater.
</P>
<P>
He ignored a lone heckler, who shouted ``Go back to Oxford, you
traitor, draft-dodger.'' Clinton's avoidance of the military draft
while studying in England in the late 1960s brought harsh criticism
from veterans during his 1992 presidential campaign, and last Memorial
Day -- his first as commander in chief -- he met with heckling and a
cool reception when he spoke at the Vietnam Veterans' Memorial.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
The president tried to comfort families of Vietnam soldiers still
missing in action by underscoring ``our solemn obligation to find
answers for those whose loved ones served but were never accounted
for.''
</P>
<P>
He urged parents to teach their children about World War II,
offering as an example the story of a Missouri elementary school
librarian who brings D-day veterans and other war survivors to speak
to students every year.
</P>
<P>
``To honor, we must remember,'' he said. ``Today, somewhere in
America, a curious child rummaging through an attic will stumble upon
his grandfather's insignia patches, a pocket guide to France, a metal
cricket, a black-and-white photo of a smiling young man in uniform.
But learning about those times and those deeds must be more than
accidental.''
</P>
<P>
Veterans of wars from World War I to the Persian Gulf war knelt or
laid flowers among the rows of white headstones that blanket the
gentle green slopes of the cemetery. Soldiers from a nearby Army base
planted small American flags in the soil in front of each of the
250,000 graves last week.

 Times Syndicate 
 Clinton Outlines China Policy (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Clinton, striving to demonstrate continued
American pressure to end Chinese human rights abuses, has outlined a
five-point program ``to support forces of constructive change in China
while strengthening the U.S.-China relationship.''
</P>
<P>
The program, described in an article appearing Tuesday on the
opinion pages of the Los Angeles Times, consists of steps by the
administration, American businesses and human rights organizations to
push China to improve human rights conditions, even though they no
longer will be linked to U.S. trade privileges.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the administration announced it would effectively end
the effort to link China's human rights record with its status as a
most-favored-nation -- MFN -- trading partner.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's article also clearly is part of the president's new
campaign to do better at explaining his foreign policy to Americans.
Clinton told The Times on Friday that controversies and apparent
shortcomings in his foreign policy were not the result of staff
weaknesses but of his inability to communicate effectively on key
issues and decisions.
</P>
<P>
Among the most controversial of those policies was his decision to
renew China's MFN status, despite Beijing's failure to comply fully on
human rights issues, as required by Congress and a presidential
executive order last year.
</P>
<P>
``Annual debates linking MFN to human rights threaten to block
needed progress on security and economic issues while yielding little
if any progress on human rights,'' Clinton wrote in the article. ``We
must pursue our human-rights agenda with China in a way that does not
isolate China. We can't help change human rights in China if we're not
there.''
</P>
<P>
The five points he outlined include:
</P>
<P>
-- Transmitting new foreign broadcasts to China, including the new
Radio Free Asia.
</P>
<P>
-- Supporting American organizations assisting private Chinese groups
working on human rights issues.
</P>
<P>
-- Developing voluntary standards for U.S. companies doing business
in or with China.
</P>
<P>
-- Promoting international attention to and support for human rights
in China.
</P>
<P>
-- Banning the import of Chinese guns and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
In context of D-day commemorations this week, the president said:
``We must not waver in the challenge of advancing those same values -- 
freedom and prosperity -- in Asia and especially China. It is in this
region that many of the profound challenges to America's national
interest can be found; it is in this region that our generation's
progress will in large part be measured.''
</P>
<P>
Relations with China should be put in context of broader U.S.
interests in the Asian-Pacific region, of which America is an integral
part, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
The president commends the Chinese government for recent steps,
including the release of two dissidents, verbal acceptance of the U.N.
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and moves toward ending the
jamming of Voice of America broadcasts. But he underscores that these
are insufficient to constitute real progress.
</P>
<P>
He calls his program ``new and vigorous,'' although each of the
individual points has been debated or acted on before.
</P>
<P>
(Optional Add End)
</P>
<P>
In the 1992 presidential campaign, Clinton pledged to make
improvement of China's human rights record a prerequisite for renewal
of its most-favored trading status and to launch Radio Free Asia to
make available new foreign media outlets to the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Congress passed authorization of Radio Free Asia this spring,
despite China's vigorous opposition on grounds that it amounted to
interference in its internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Establishing voluntary principles for U.S. businesses -- an idea
tried with disputed impact in South Africa -- is a long-standing option
borrowed from parties who oppose using MFN as leverage on human
rights.

 New Croatian Money Anathema to Serbs (Zagreb) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ZAGREB, Croatia
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Croatia Monday revived a currency used during a
pro-Nazi World War II regime as part of celebrations marking the third
anniversary of independence.
</P>
<P>
In dumping the dinar and embracing the kuna, the government of
President Franjo Tudjman seemed likely to complicate peace efforts by
riling rebel Serbs, who occupy 27 percent of the country. For them and
for many others, the kuna evokes memories of the brutal Ustashe regime
of Ante Pavelic.
</P>
<P>
In a ceremony at the Croatian National Bank, avoided by much of the
foreign diplomatic corps, Tudjman marked Statehood Day by exchanging
dinars for kunas -- printed in Germany. The notes, he said, are the
most beautiful in the world and are ``the final act on the bumpy road
to the independent and sovereign Croatian state.''
</P>
<P>
In a region where nationalism is the dominant coin of political
discourse, where an ethnically revealing first name can trigger a
violent response, the resurrection of a currency with an echo of
Croatia's fascist past is provocative. By all accounts, Croatia's
Serbs suffered under the Ustashe regime. They are led today by
hard-liners determined not to negotiate with the Croatian government.
The Serbs took up arms against Croatia when it declared independence
from Serb-dominated Yugoslavia in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Monuments to Yugoslav and anti-fascist heroes such at Marshal Tito
have been replaced by those to Croat nationalists, and Serbian words
have been purged from the language.
</P>
<P>
At root is the question of whether there is room in Croatia for
Serbs and other ethnic groups if the government continues to take such
steps.
</P>
<P>
Asked during a Saturday night television interview whether the
reintroduction of the kuna would harm relations with Serbs, Tudjman
replied: ``Serbs in Croatia must understand they are a minority.''
</P>
<P>
Slavko Goldstein, a leader of Croatia's tiny Jewish community and a
publisher in Zagreb, said he believed Tudjman's move, despite his
personal history as a veteran of the war against the Ustashe state,
would offend those in Croatia who suffered. Effectively, the new
currency is the monetary version of a swastika.
</P>
<P>
Goldstein and other analysts hypothesize that Tudjman ordered the
new currency as part of his policy of balancing moderates within his
party with nationalists, such as Defense Minister Gojko Susak, the
architect of the failed policy to carve out a Croatian protectorate in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, several leading moderates have broken with
Tudjman. The main issue has been Tudjman's refusal to get rid of Susak
and other extremists who oppose Croatia's recent decision to back a
peace deal between Bosnian Croats and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the kuna could have consequences for that deal
as well. Nationalist Croat officials in Bosnia have said they plan to
use it in Croat-held territory there instead of the Bosnian dinar, as
ordered under the peace deal. Kuna is Croatian for marten, a type of
weasel, whose pelts were bartered in Roman times. Croatia's brief
medieval kingdom used a coin boasting the image of the kuna.

 Clinton Faces Delicate Task on D-Day Anniversary Trip (Arlington) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ARLINGTON, Va.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the midst of a quiet ceremony at Arlington
National Cemetery Monday, President Clinton's tribute to the nation's
war dead was interrupted by a protester who shouted the sort of
comment that gives sleepless nights to the White House aides planning
this week's European tour.
</P>
<P>
``Go back to Oxford, you traitor, draft-dodger,'' a man yelled from
the rear of the white marble amphitheater before being hurried out.
</P>
<P>
Apparently taken aback, Clinton stumbled over the next few words of
his speech, which was intended not only to mark Memorial Day but also
to lay the groundwork for the eight-day trip to Italy, England and
France that starts Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The trip, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Normandy
invasion, offers what should be a White House public relations dream,
with major speeches and heart-tugging ceremonies scheduled at the
sites of some of the climactic battles that helped the United States
earn its mantle as the world's champion of democracy.
</P>
<P>
But even some of his own senior aides worry that the trip instead
will remind Americans of Clinton's efforts to avoid the draft during
the Vietnam war and underscore questions about his performance as
commander-in- chief since becoming president.
</P>
<P>
In fact, he is going back to Oxford -- as a Rhodes Scholar there,
he helped organize Vietnam anti-war demonstrations -- although that
stop has been hastily rescheduled from the middle of the trip to the
end, in part to avoid the inevitable comparisons with the veterans of
World War II.
</P>
<P>
``I think this trip looms a lot larger for him than it would for
another president,'' historian Michael Beschloss said. ``The president
who didn't serve in the military and Vietnam is speaking on D-day -- 
and beyond that, a president who is known for spending less time on
his role as a world leader than most presidents do.''
</P>
<P>
He has been buffeted by complaints that his policy toward Haiti,
Bosnia, Somalia and elsewhere has been wavering and hesitant. Only 40
percent of those interviewed in a Washington Post-ABC News poll this
month said they approved of his handling of foreign policy; 53 percent
disapproved.
</P>
<P>
But the trip also could increase his stature, as foreign travel
often does for presidents. ``It could be that the speeches will be so
good and the reception so warm and the relations with leaders in Italy
and France and England so obviously enhanced that this will be a help
for him,'' Beschloss said.
</P>
<P>
The journey begins Wednesday with a flight to Rome, where Clinton
will meet with Pope John Paul II and with the new Italian prime
minister, Silvio Berlusconi. Later, Clinton will meet with Prime
Minister John Major at Chequers, the country retreat of British prime
ministers, and with French President Francois Mitterrand in Paris.
</P>
<P>
One topic will be the very current problem of Bosnia. ``The big
issue is whether the great powers are going to be able to hold
together in some kind of common policy in Bosnia that is respectable
enough for them to defend,'' said Charles William Maynes, editor of
Foreign Policy magazine.
</P>
<P>
(Optional Add End)
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, on the 40th anniversary of D-Day, President Reagan's
emotional address to the former U.S. Rangers at Pointe du Hoc was
perhaps the most memorable speech of his presidency. ``It was the
beginning of `morning again in America,' '' the dewy-eyed theme of
Reagan's 1984 re-election campaign, recalled Michael Deaver, a top
aide who helped plan that trip.
</P>
<P>
Actually, Reagan had spent World War II making training films on a
Hollywood set, but with his patriotic persona and his trillion-dollar
defense buildup he was treated as a hero at such occasions.
</P>
<P>
In his speeches, Clinton will reminisce about the war record of his
father, William Jefferson Blythe II, who spent two years in North
Africa and Italy in an Army unit that rebuilt trucks and jeeps. After
returning safely home, he was killed in a car accident six months
later, three months before Clinton was born.

 Summer Hiring Surge Forecasted (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. business executives intend to hire more employees
this summer than at any time over the past five years, says a report
released Monday by the country's largest temporary-help firm, Manpower
Inc.
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee-based Manpower's quarterly employment survey of more than
15,000 companies nationwide showed that 29 percent of the firms
responding to the survey expect to undertake additional hiring during
the summer while 7 percent plan staff reductions.
</P>
<P>
``These hiring projections confirm a full return to pre-recession
job conditions . . . despite a lingering downsizing in some
companies,'' said Mitchell S. Fromstein, Manpower's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
Manpower's survey is closely watched, partly because it correctly
signaled a sharp slowing of economic growth in 1989, as well as the
economy's uneven recovery beginning in early 1991. The new survey
forecasts the jobs' outlook for the permanent U.S. work force for the
months of July, August and September.
</P>
<P>
Unmployment nationwide has gradually dropped, reaching 6.4 percent
in April. The Labor Department is scheduled to report its job
statistics for May on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The hot issue for economists is the impact that continuing job
growth and lower unemployment might have on wages and price inflation.
Some say the economy is now approaching ``full employment,'' or the
level of employment at which companies have to compete to hire workers
and workers begin to demand higher wages, thus fueling inflation.
</P>
<P>
DRI/McGraw-Hill Inc., a research firm based in Lexington, Mass.,
said in a report this month that the unemployment rate is nearing 6.2
percent, which is the figure the firm has set for full employment.
Despite the Federal Reserve's raising of interest rates, it said,
unemployment is expected to fall to 6 percent by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
At 6.2 percent, said Cynthia Latta, a DRI/McGraw-Hill analyst, the
lower unemployment rate ``will put some upward pressure on wages.''
</P>
<P>
However, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich last week told Reuter
Financial Television that the unemployment rate at which inflationary
pressures develop may be lower than in the past. Because of
technological advances and competition from overseas, the average
American worker ``is in no position to demand wage increases,'' Reich
said.
</P>
<P>
Fromstein said that he did not believe the Fed's actions in raising
interest rates would affect Manpower's projections for summer hiring,
although they could affect jobs over the longer haul.
</P>
<P>
Fromstein said that for the first time in several years, the
economy showed hiring strength in both manufacturing and the wholesale
and retail trade businesses. Both are considered indicators of a
rising economy, according to Manpower.
</P>
<P>
The survey forecast the weakest hiring prospects in transportation,
public utilities, education and other service industries, some of
which helped account for job growth in earlier recovery stages.
</P>
<P>
Manpower said that Midwestern companies are expected to lead the
nation in hiring in the summer quarter.
</P>
<P>
It said that its survey of Southern employers, confirms that the
South is in a period of ``general employment expansion.''
</P>
<P>
The recession-wracked West and Northeast, both of which had lagged
behind other regions in job growth, also will make gains during the
summer quarter, Manpower said.
</P>
<P>
Separately, the Association for Manufacturing Technology in McLean
said on Sunday that orders for U.S.-made machine tools rose 11.7
percent in April, reaching the highest level in 12 months.
</P>
<P>
Economists see this as another sign of future economic growth,
because manufacturers use machine tools to make a wide range of
products.

 U.S. Aims to Head Off Threat of African Famine (Addis Ababa) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A high-level U.S. aid delegation said
Monday it aims to mobilize an urgent global response to food shortages
in eastern Africa before they grow into full-blown famine.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia, which was devastated 10 years ago by starvation that
claimed hundreds of thousands of lives, this year risks becoming the
center of a famine in which as many as 20 million people in nine
countries could risk death, said J. Brian Atwood, head of the U.S.
Agency for International Development. Famine threatens a swath of
eastern Africa from Sudan to Tanzania, Atwood told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Relief workers in Ethiopia report hundreds of deaths since the
current round of food shortages began here and scores of fresh graves
in villages in the south of the country. Most of those in danger are
victims of recurrent drought. Here, as in surrounding nations, the
annual summer rains failed last year and food stocks are desperately
low. But Atwood said about a third of those at risk this year are in
danger because of wars-notably in Sudan, Somalia and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Atwood said the mission, which includes representatives of three
main U.S. charities, is part of a new Clinton administration effort to
shift U.S. policy from chronic emergency gear to crisis prevention. He
said the administration aims to step up cooperation with what it has
called ``a new breed'' of pragmatic African leaders in Ethiopia,
Eritrea and Uganda. President Clinton hopes to use the mission ``to
raise consciousness of this issue at the highest possible levels'' and
win more aid for eastern Africa from European governments and Japan,
Atwood said. ``This is a desperate situation and we need to respond to
it now to avoid what could become a major famine as soon as August if
the rains fail'' again, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team -- which includes the heads of CARE, Catholic Relief
Services and the International Rescue Committee as well as the leading
congressional campaigner on hunger issues, Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio -- 
will go to Europe this week to seek multilateral support for a program
to head off another famine. Atwood said the more than $1.5 billion
spent by the U.S. government in an effort to halt starvation and
anarchy in Somalia had spotlighted in Washington the need to prevent -- 
rather than respond to -- humanitarian calamities in Africa. So, he
said, has ``the holocaust'' in Rwanda, where the United Nations has
estimated that 200,000 people have been killed in tribal massacres and
battles.
</P>
<P>
``Just the other day we made a decision to contribute $35 million
additional to handle this disaster'' in Rwanda, he said. ``One wonders
if we had had that $35 million in the previous two years whether we
could have done something to avoid the killing.''
</P>
<P>
Atwood said that, with the new focus on ``crisis prevention,'' the
administration seeks to make Africa a top priority for development
assistance ``on a par'' with Russia and Eastern Europe. U.S. officials
have voiced a commitment to working closely with leaders in Ethiopia,
Eritrea and Uganda who have emerged in recent years. Those leaders,
who have stressed pragmatism in economic development and in mediating
conflicts in the region, ``have started on a success story, and with a
little bit of help, they can turn things around in their own countries
and, eventually, affect the whole region,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
But the goal of ``sustainable development'' in the Third World to
prevent underdeveloped nations from falling into chronic crises has
long been a goal of the international community and has proven
difficult to fulfill. Crises such as famines or wars often force the
diversion of development aid funds into emergency relief. With
pressures remaining high in Washington and other capitals for budget
cutting, and a public perception that Africa is a ``bottomless pit''
for aid money, it is not clear whether the U.S. administration and
other donor governments can allocate sufficient funds for both.
</P>
<P>
Atwood said U.S. disaster assistance worldwide is about $1.6
billion, about twice what is spent on development aid that could
permit stricken countries to become less dependent. He called that ``a
poor ratio'' that should be reversed.

 Cash Crunch Threatens Palestinian Rule (Gaza City) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the euphoria that followed Israel's
troop withdrawal begins to fade, anxiety is growing over the critical
lack of money to govern and rebuild the new Palestinian autonomous
areas of Gaza and Jericho.
</P>
<P>
The cash crunch threatens every part of Palestinian society, which
has been left to fend for itself with this month's hand-over of civil
and security powers from Israel. The Palestine Liberation
Organization, while steadily asserting its control, is broke.
</P>
<P>
The PLO's best hope for financial relief is rich donor countries -- 
and they have moved slowly, and cautiously, to translate promises into
hard cash.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian police force, for example, has received less than
half of the promised donations of equipment from the West and will be
forced to borrow Israeli communications equipment just so officers can
talk to each other in the field. France promised to provide a $2
million system -- the most urgent of the police force's unmet
requirements -- but has only just begun the weeks-long selection and
purchasing process.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, about 13,000 public employees responsible for tax
collection, licensing, education, health services and more in Gaza and
Jericho aren't sure their next paycheck at the end of June will be
covered. Palestinian hospitals, to be cut off from Israeli subsidies
Wednesday, have no way to pay for patients' food and for expensive
referrals to Israeli institutions.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, of the $1.2 billion pledged by donor countries for
emergency reconstruction of the infrastructure in Gaza and Jericho,
only about $60 million has been received by the World Bank, which is
trustee for the donations.
</P>
<P>
``Thank God we had the vacation (for a Muslim feast) and people
were celebrating,'' said Riad Khouderi, president of Gaza's al-Azhar
University. ``But after that, what if people are still stepping over
garbage in the streets and the schools remain in such poor condition?
Even to get rid of all aspects of the occupation -- to get rid of
fences, iron bars and road blocks -- it takes money, people, and trucks
that we don't have.''
</P>
<P>
According to Western diplomats and PLO officials present at
meetings of the donor countries, the urgency of the cash crisis is
well understood. But the bureaucratic machinery in various nations
that should translate those good intentions into money in the bank has
proved cumbersome.
</P>
<P>
One problem is that most of the money already promised to the
Palestinians is earmarked for specific reconstruction projects in Gaza
and Jericho. An additional $14 million has been pledged to help the
Palestinian police pay operating costs, but little of it has actually
reached the hands of self-rule officials.
</P>
<P>
The United States, for example, promised $5 million for the police
more than two weeks ago. The money has not yet been delivered. Nor has
the $5.7 million promised in April by the European Union. The first
six months' estimated budget for the police, including salaries and
fuel costs, is $40 million.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
One possible mechanism for alleviating the crisis and bypassing the
legal constraints on donors is just now being worked out. Diplomats
involved in the process said donor countries may be asked to give
money to the private Johan Jurgen Holst Fund, set up in memory of the
late Norwegian foreign minister who brought the PLO and Israel
together for peace talks.
</P>
<P>
It has fewer restrictions than other World Bank funds, and donors
could specify that money contributed to it be used for operating costs
in Gaza and Jericho.
</P>
<P>
Still, it could be weeks before the details are worked out. A
crucial senior-level meeting of representatives of the donor countries
has been rescheduled several times since the Israel-to-PLO hand-over
in Gaza and Jericho. The tentative date is now sometime around June 9,
according to one diplomat, who said earlier meetings were canceled
because of the ``technical'' problems of getting the right people
together at the right time.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Another problem has been continuing friction between the World Bank
and the PLO over jurisdiction, planning responsibilities and ultimate
control over how the donors' money will be spent. The World Bank has
insisted on strict accounting procedures, on tying money to specific
projects and on distancing PLO chairman Yasser Arafat from the levers
of control.
</P>
<P>
``Donors don't feel comfortable with Arafat, and now he's in a
mess,'' said Salah Abdel Shafi, a leading Gaza economist. ``Authority
has been transferred to the PLO by Israel, but the donors remain very
conservative.''
</P>
<P>
Complicating matters further, the PLO is only now finalizing
appointments to the 25-member Palestinian Authority that will govern
Gaza and Jericho. Political infighting among Palestinians continues to
prevent the naming of city councils in the Gaza Strip and Jericho.
</P>
<P>
Without the authority and without municipal councils, there is no
one to solicit bids and sign contracts for redevelopment projects.
That means there is no one to receive donations -- if anyone cares to
help subsidize the day-to-day costs of self-rule -- other than Arafat
himself, a situation that in itself could further delay donations.

 Hungary's Newly Elected Ex-Communists Must Now 
 `Create Capitalists' (Budapest) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BUDAPEST, Hungary
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three slightly sheepish officials of the
Hungarian Socialist Party -- the former Communists -- sat sipping coffee
and discussing the strange turn of events here: their restoration to
power by the voters in the midst of a national drive to create a
free-enterprise economy.
</P>
<P>
``It's a great problem,'' Gyula Horvath, a self-employed handyman,
said of Sunday's election. ``Workers are not members of the party any
longer. . . . It seems it is the task of the Socialist Party that we
have to create capitalists now.''
</P>
<P>
Josef Kalapacs, the party's local campaign chief, is a good example
of the curious role reversal in which the party finds itself caught.
Formerly a skilled worker at the state-owned Csepel steel plant here,
Kalapacs is now a shareholder in a struggling pipe-making enterprise
spun off from the now defunct steel mill. ``We have reached the stage
where people are forced to become entrepreneurs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The third party official, Tamas Huszar, is also a former Csepel
employee and another new entrepreneur, having set up his own
construction firm. He has also switched allegiance from the old
Communist Workers Party to the Socialists, who sprang from the reform
wing of the authoritarian regime that was ousted in 1990 after a
45-year rule.
</P>
<P>
It is hard to image what Karl Marx might say if he could hear these
three ``socialists'' airing their capitalist aspirations. All three
readily agreed, for example, that the state ``should get out of the
economy,'' although they had differing views on just how quickly this
should happen and what residual role government should play.
</P>
<P>
But such views reflect a central paradox of post-Cold War Eastern
Europe -- namely, that a growing number of constituents of the former
ruling Communist parties are budding entrepreneurs whose interests are
far removed from those of the once exalted proletariat.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Hungarian Socialist Party -- which will form this
country's new government in coming weeks -- is a hodgepodge of
conflicting interest groups. There are unreformed old-style Communist
apparatchiks, labor union leaders, reformed social democrats,
struggling small entrepreneurs and a new capitalist aristocracy of
``Red Barons,'' born out of the old party elite.
</P>
<P>
But swelling the flood of roughly 1.5 million new Socialist voters
on Sunday, according to the Hungarian Gallup polling organization,
were people from all walks of life with fond memories of the security
and social welfare benefits of the old Marxist government and a
distrust of the hazards of free-market democracy.
</P>
<P>
``There has been quite a shift in the (Socialist) voter profile,''
said Gallup spokesman Robert Manchin. ``It is much more anti-market,
anti-privatization, more for egalitarian values and social
redistribution. They are the traditional, old-time socialist
supporters.
</P>
<P>
``This is something that should bother the Socialist Party and
everybody else, since they didn't run on a traditional socialist
program, but its (supporters want) to go back to egalitarian
solutions.''
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the Socialist victory, the question being asked by
Hungarians and foreigners alike is which faction of the highly
eclectic party will prevail in the coming struggle to define its
economic and social policies.
</P>
<P>
Will it be the more orthodox, old-time socialists and labor
advocates led by Sandor Nagy, whose name was listed second on the
party's election slate? Or the faction led by Laszlo Bekesi, the
party's most prominent economic reformist, who was listed third on the
slate and is likely to become the next finance minister? The party
will meet in convention here Saturday to outline its policies and
formally choose its nominee for prime minister.

 Rosty Rejects Plea Agreement; Vows to Fight Charges (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A defiant Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., rejected a
proposed plea bargain with federal prosecutors Monday night and vowed
to fight in court efforts to convict him of an alleged conspiracy to
defraud the government out of several hundred thousand dollars.
</P>
<P>
``Federal prosecutors threaten to indict me if I fail to plead
guilty to a series of crimes I did not commit,'' Rostenkowski said in
a written statement. ``I will not make any deals with them. I did not
commit any crimes. My conscience is clear and my 42-year record as an
elected official is one I am pround to once again run on.''
</P>
<P>
The statement by Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, came the day before sources have said United States
Attorney Eric H. Holder Jr. would ask a grand jury to indict the
Chicago Democrat. Holder's office declined comment Monday. Barring a
last minute overture by Rostenkowski, prosecutors planned to indict
him Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
``The government is ready to go,'' one source familiar with the
negotiations said. Other sources said that the government's case was
already set for presentation to a grand jury, regardless of whether
they heard from Rostenkowski by the deadline.
</P>
<P>
After more than two weeks of discussing the possibility of a plea
bargain, Rostenkowski, 66, last week declined a deal in which he would
plead guilty to a felony and spend a limited amount of time in jail.
</P>
<P>
Options for Rostenkowski had run out, as had his tenure as chairman
of Ways and Means, a committee that puts him in the forefront on
President Clinton's health care legislation as well as major trade,
welfare and tax bills. If the grand jury returns an indictment
punishable by at least two years in prison, under normal procedures of
the House Democratic Caucus, Rostenkowski would have to resign from
the committee chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski made clear last night he stood ready to step aside
from his leadership role and battle to salvage his political life.
</P>
<P>
``If I am indicted I will temporarily give up the
chairmanship....but will continue to serve as an active member of
Congress,'' Rostenkowski said. ``...If I am indicted, I will fight in
court. I will present a compelling case to the jury which will, I am
confident, find me not guilty....
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski's action and the anticipated indictment clouds the
political horizon for key issues such as health care and sets the
stage for Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla., to take the reins of Ways and
Means.
</P>
<P>
Three key Democrats on Ways and Means said they were not surprised
by the chairman's decision and said the committee would rally around
Gibbons in the fight for health care. But they conceded that, as
representative John Lewis, D-Ga., put it, ``It will be much more
difficult without him.''
</P>
<P>
Lewis, Rep. Jake Pickle, D-Tex., and Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.,
all said they expected no challenge to Gibbons' becoming acting
chairman under House Democratic Caucus rules. Pickle, who is No. 3 in
seniority said, ``There is a remote possibility that 50 members could
petition the Democratic Caucus to change the rules, but I doubt that
will happen.''
</P>
<P>
Rangel, who is next in seniority behind Pickle, and Lewis, who is
close to both the White House and the House Democratic leadership,
echoed the view that Gibbons would take over without a serious
challenge.
</P>
<P>
Rangel said he thought the committee's consideration of health care
would go forward ``ninety percent as normal.'' He said Gibbons ``will
probably work very closely with Rostenkowski to find consensus among
the committee's Democratic members.''
</P>
<P>
A senior committee Republican, Rep. Clay Shaw of Florida agreed
that there was nothing surprising about the chairman's decision. ``You
don't check your citizenship at the door when you go to Congress,''
Shaw said, ``and he is entitled to a fair trial. If he feels he's not
guilty of the charges, he should fight them.''
</P>
<P>
Shaw said that he thought Rostenkowski would have faced great
difficulty in delivering a health bill to the President's
specifications, but said with the ``disruption'' of the change in the
chairmanship, ``this probably backs us up a ways.''
</P>
<P>
A plea bargain would have given Rostenkowski a slight chance of
retaining his chairmanship. Caucus rules do not require a member
convicted of criminal charges to resign from office or leadership
positions, although such members are likely to face an ethics
investigation and disciplinary actions.
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors have outlined a broad case against Rostenkowski
of conspiracy to defraud the government in what has been described as
``kitchen sink'' approach alleging abuses of official accounts for
postage, leased automobiles, office space, supplies and personnel.
Rostenkowski has publicly denied all the allegations.
</P>
<P>
The FBI has investigated whether several so-called ``ghost
employees'' in Rostenkowski's Chicago office received pay for work
never down. The probe also examined whether Rostenkowski purchased
personal and gift items through his expense account at the House
Stationary Store. In addition, the prosecution's case also reportedly
examines whether government leased cars were used primarily for
personal use rather than official business and if Rostenkowski and
other lawmakers traded postage vouchers and stamps for thousands of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski, completing his 36th year in Congress, entered plea
discussions in an effort to reduce or eliminate any prison sentence
while avoiding a lengthy legal battle. He also wanted to try to retain
his chairmanship. Such talks are considered normal and will not affect
his trial, should he be indicted.

 Clinton Hails D-Day on Memorial Day (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an alabaster-white amphitheater surrounded by a sea
of headstones, President Clinton told a packed audience of veterans
and visitors Monday never to forget those who had died fighting for
freedom.
</P>
<P>
``Fifty years ago the world learned just what Americans are capable
of,'' Clinton noted during a Memorial Day service at Arlington
National Cemetery. ``World War II was an era of sacrifice unequal in
our history. It was the energies of free people who turned the tide''
against totalitarianism.
</P>
<P>
The 50th anniversary of the D-Day invasion of Normandy echoed
throughout Clinton's speech. Straining to see and hear him from her
wheelchair was retired Army nurse Dorothy Fearn Olsen, who had treated
D-Day casualties during her 19 months as a combat nurse.
</P>
<P>
Afterward, she recounted helping the wounded at the Battle of the
Bulge and being among the first medical units at the liberation of the
Buchenwald concentration camp. She was only 24. Olsen recited a list
of nurses who had served in U.S. wars, beginning with Clara Barton in
the Civil War and ending with Frances Slanger, a little-known nurse
who was killed in Belgium before the Battle of the Bulge.
</P>
<P>
``There had been various letters written by GIs to Stars and
Stripes thanking the nurses for being there,'' she said. Slanger
``wrote a very beautiful letter that ended . . . ``It's an honor and a
privilege to be there when you open your eyes and say, ``Hiya, babe.'
'' Clinton's speech in the cemetery's Memorial Amphitheater came just
before noon. Earlier in the morning, before placing a wreath on the
Tomb of the Unknowns, he and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton had
been the hosts for a breakfast for World War II veterans and leaders
of veterans organizations.
</P>
<P>
During his speech Monday, Clinton said the endless rows of graves
along the hillside of Arlington are reminders of ``the high cost of
freedom.''
</P>
<P>
The famous are there among them, he said. ``But far more numerous
are Americans who are not famous, are not legend, but whose deeds are
the backbone'' of democracy.
</P>
<P>
``Let us also hold a special place for all our living veterans,''
he urged. ``We owe them a lasting debt of gratitude.''

 Service Draws Families of Vietnam's Delayed Casualties (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Washington awoke on Memorial Day morning, 11
families sat in folding chairs on a grassy hill and, far away from the
day's more elaborate events, cried in each other's arms.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam Veterans Memorial ebbed like a black wave in the
distance. The names of their loved ones could not be on that granite
wall, because unlike the dead whose sacrifice was etched there, their
loved ones had died after the fighting ended -- of Agent Orange
poisoning, of injuries that never healed, in suicides. In a war that
has seemed exiled from the brotherhood of conflicts, these dead are
the lost veterans. The Friends of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, which
decided they had been forgotten long enough, held Monday's ceremony to
honor them.
</P>
<P>
It brought nine members of the Reynolds family, ages 14 months to
74 years, from Palo Alto, Calif. It brought Jennie LeFevre from Shady
Side, Md., to honor a husband killed by Agent Orange. It brought Diana
Steele from Newport News, Va., bearing a grief almost unimaginable:
Her husband and father had both taken their own lives within nine
months of each other. ``Merciful God, we ask your tender blessing on
all who are gathered here,'' said writer Joe Galloway, who covered the
Vietnam conflict. ``You have brought beside you the souls of some good
soldiers who suffered greatly long after their war was over and who
are loved and missed deeply.'' '
</P>
<P>
More than 3 million Americans served in Vietnam. Among them were
58,190 who were killed or missing in action, about 450,000 wounded in
action and an estimated 117,000 who have since died.
</P>
<P>
``You know and I know what really cut their lives short,'' Galloway
said. ``And who among us dares judge them for the way they lived or
the way they died?''
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two veterans were honored, among them Pulitzer Prize-winning
author Lewis Puller Jr., of Alexandria, who took his life this month.
Their names will be entered in an honor roll displayed near the
Vietnam Veterans Memorial. After speeches and prayers, the families
walked to the Wall. At the foot of the polished panels, they placed
red carnations, a white spider mum and tributes for their lost loved
ones.
</P>
<P>
Diana Steele left her husband's Purple Heart. She said Robert
William Steele was diagnosed with depression just after the war. The
Army soldier killed himself in 1983, she said, because ``the
experience of Vietnam was so traumatic for him. He was such a gentle
man. He couldn't deal with it.'' He was 37.
</P>
<P>
Patricia Codd's husband and Diana Steele's father, Nicholas Joseph
Codd Jr., served in the Army in 1966, then again in 1970 and 1971. He
committed suicide at age 51 in 1984. ``He made nine suicide
attempts,'' said his widow, who lives in Hampton, Va. He rarely spoke
of war, but once he shared a memory.
</P>
<P>
``They were on an ambush,'' Patricia Codd said. ``They heard a
noise. They opened fire. It turned out to be women and children. He
talked about having to pick them up and put them in body bags.''
</P>
<P>
Codd had five children and 12 grandchildren ``who will never know
him,'' she said. ``We're hoping this will put all of this to rest. But
I don't think it'll ever be over.''
</P>
<P>
Jennie LeFevre, 62 and gray-haired, wore white tennis shoes, white
slacks and an orange T-shirt that said ``Widow of Agent Orange
Victim.'' Her Air Force husband, Gerald Henry LeFevre, died in 1989.
``These men need their own wall,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
The Reynolds family mourned Terrence Michael Reynolds, dead at 25.
He served in the Army in 1966. He suffered wounds that left him a
paraplegic and kept him hospitalized for 2½ years. In 1970, he died of
a heart attack related to his injuries. ``I miss him terribly,'' said
one of his sisters, Kathy LeVain. ``After 25 years, I still miss
him.''
</P>
<P>
Reynolds's son, mother, a brother, two sisters, three nephews and a
brother-in-law came to honor him. They showed a faded black-and-white
photo of a young man in a hospital bed with large expressive eyes,
dark eyebrows and a mischievous, yet sad smile. ``He was quite a
prankster,'' said another sister, Melinda Burnham. ``He was always
cracking me up. Always making people laugh,'' offered his brother, Jim
Glanville. ``That's how I'd like him remembered.''

 Rostenkowski Decides to Fight Fraud, Abuse of Office Charges (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., said Monday that he has chosen to fight charges
of fraud and abuse of his public office, rather than making a deal
with federal prosecutors to plead guilty to lesser offenses.
</P>
<P>
``I have always fought for what I believe in. I strongly believe
that I am not guilty of these charges, and will fight to regain my
reputation in court,'' Rostenkowski said in a statement issued Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came on the eve of Tuesday's deadline by the government
to accept or reject its plea-bargain arrangement. ``That is a far more
attractive arrangement option than pleading guilty to crimes that I
did not commit,'' Rostenkowski said.
</P>
<P>
The decision appears to make it certain that he will be indicted on
a series of felony charges -- possibly as early as Tuesday, sources
familiar with the case said. A Justice Department spokesman declined
to comment on Rostenkowski's announcement.
</P>
<P>
The Chicago lawmaker's lawyers had urged him to consider the deal
being offered by U.S. Attorney Eric Holder, a Clinton administration
appointee. Although it was understood to have meant a one-year prison
term and his resignation from Congress, the bargain would have spared
Rostenkowski and his family the humiliation of a public trial and
possibly a longer prison term.
</P>
<P>
Under the rules of the House Democratic Caucus, an indictment on
felony charges punishable by a prison term of more than two years
would mean that Rostenkowski would have to relinquish his
chairmanship, until and unless he were acquitted.
</P>
<P>
The implications of his removal go far beyond the effects on the
35-year congressional career of a single lawmaker. Rostenkowski, whose
legislative deal-making skills are considered unparalleled in
Congress, is one of President Clinton's most crucial allies in the
administration's uphill efforts to pass comprehensive health care
legislation this year.
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski, 66, was considered so vital to the passage of the
health bill that Clinton went to Chicago to campaign for him earlier
this year, when it appeared that he faced a strong challenge in the
Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
The Ways and Means Committee has already begun its deliberations on
the health bill, and it now appears it will lose its chairman just as
it is to start its voting after Congress' weeklong Memorial Day
recess. Ways and Means is one of five committees in Congress that have
jurisdiction over the bill.
</P>
<P>
In the last few days, as negotiations between Rostenkowski and
federal prosecutors reached a critical phase, a pall had settled over
the House. While few House members had been willing to discuss it on
the record, the situation had seemed to overshadow all the House's
official business, and was the topic of many whispered conversations
in the corridors and cloakrooms of the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
Although the chairman had agonized over the choice before him, the
idea of pleading guilty had gone against all his instincts, friends
said. ``He finally came to closure late this afternoon,'' spokesman
Jim Jaffe said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The helm of the committee is expected to pass to the second most
senior Democrat, Rep. Sam Gibbons of Florida. Though genial and
well-liked, Gibbons has not been tested on such major legislation. His
expertise is in trade matters.
</P>
<P>
Though Rostenkowski would relinquish the chairmanship, he could
still exert considerable influence as a member of the committee. The
Democrats on the panel are fiercely loyal to him, and have received
many breaks for their constituents from him in the past. Also, he
hired the Ways and Means Committee's entire staff.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski is represented by Robert S. Bennett, a leading
Washington attorney well known for his defense of public officials and
others accused of white-collar crimes. It is expected that Bennett,
who also is representing Clinton against a sexual harassment suit
filed by Paula Corbin Jones, could delay any trial until after the
November elections.
</P>
<P>
The federal investigation of Rostenkowski has been under way for
more than two years.
</P>
<P>
Among the charges that probably would be included in an indictment:
</P>
<P>
-- That between 1985 and 1991, he illegally converted stamps from the
House Post Office to cash for his personal use. A key witness against
him is likely to be former House Postmaster Robert V. Rota, who
pleaded guilty to misdemeanor embezzlement charges last July.
</P>
<P>
-- That he improperly used office funds to buy lavish gifts for
friends from the House Stationery Store. On the advice of his lawyers,
Rostenkowski earlier reimbursed Congress for about $82,000 of
purchases, without admitting wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
-- That he converted government-leased cars to his personal
ownership.
</P>
<P>
-- That he used government funds to pay ``ghost employees'' -- people
who were on his payroll but did no work.
</P>
<P>
All told, the charges could be such that the chairman would face a
lengthy prison term, if convicted.

 Muhammad Disregarded Security Plan (Riverside) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
RIVERSIDE, Calif.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
University of California officials said Monday
that Khallid Abdul Muhammad, the controversial Nation of Islam figure
shot in the legs here Sunday night, disregarded an elaborate security
plan by continuing to answer questions outside the gymnasium where he
had just given a speech.
</P>
<P>
The alleged gunman has been identified as James Edward Bess, who
authorities said is a member of a ``subset of the Nation of Islam'' in
the Tacoma, Wash., area. Bess was severely beaten by a crowd of
bystanders and had to be rescued by police. He is under heavy guard at
a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
Muhammad, 43, is listed in stable condition at another local
hospital. He was an aide to Louis Farrakhan, head of the Nation of
Islam, until he was demoted following a national outcry over
antisemitic remarks he made during a speech last November in New
Jersey. Some members of the crowd that beat Bess shouted that the
gunman worked ``for the Jews.''
</P>
<P>
Minutes after leaving the gym, Muhammad was shot at close range
while standing at the top of some steps about 100 yards from the gym
entrance on the University of California at Riverside. The security
plan drawn up by campus police and Muhammad's bodyguards had called
for him to exit quickly through a rear door and leave by car.
Authorities had no explanation for why Muhammad did not follow the
plan.
</P>
<P>
Five of his bodyguards were also wounded in the attack. Only one of
the bodyguards was wounded seriously enough to be in the hospital
tonight.
</P>
<P>
The investigation into the shooting is being handled by University
of California campus police, who would not speculate Monday on the
motive for the attack.
</P>
<P>
According to Leon Forrest, former editor of the Nation of Islam's
newspaper, Muhammad Speaks, the shooting of Muhammad by a disgruntled
Nation member is reflective of ongoing leadership problems in the
organization. It was not uncommon for people to join the Nation and
then leave, often over ideological differences or a belief that power
was not distributed in an equitable way, said Forrest, now chair of
African American studies at Northwestern University.
</P>
<P>
Joseph E. Lowery, president of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference, said he regarded the shooting, which he deplored, as an
``internal conflict'' in the Nation of Islam.
</P>
<P>
Police said they found three weapons of Bess's in addition to the
9mm handgun used in the shooting. Two additional 9mm weapons were
found at the scene. In his vehicle nearby, they said, they found a
rifle with a telescope sight.
</P>
<P>
Riverside Police Chief Ken Fortier said that police are not ruling
out a conspiracy but they believe Bess acted alone. He said Bess has
not been charged yet.
</P>
<P>
Forrest recalled the shooting 29 years ago of Malcolm X, a former
Nation of Islam leader who broke away and attracted a following of
young blacks. Three members of the Nation of Islam were convicted of
the killing.
</P>
<P>
University officials said security arrangements for Muhammad's
Sunday appearance had been adequate.
</P>
<P>
``There was good security,'' David H. Warren, the university's
executive vice chancellor said at a news conference here Monday.
``What went wrong was he (Muhammad) completely broke with what his
scheduling was and his routing was.''
</P>
<P>
Since being suspended by Farrakhan in February, Muhammad has
continued to make controversial speeches, describing himself at one
point as a ``truth terrorist'' for the Nation of Islam leader. He has
done little to soften the rhetoric that first gained widespread
attention in an address Nov. 29 at Kean College in New Jersey that was
later denounced by President Clinton, Congress and many black and
Jewish leaders.
</P>
<P>
In his two-hour speech here Sunday, Muhammad sounded many familiar
themes, including the need for blacks to overcome white racist
oppression and the attempt by Jews in the entertainment industry to
promote negative images of blacks.
</P>
<P>
University officials said Monday they considered blocking Muhammad
from speaking but decided to allow it because they feared being sued.
After protests from Jewish groups on campus, however, they refused to
allow Muhammad's bodyguards to conduct searches of the audience, and
they also insisted that reporters be allowed to bring recording
equipment into the gym.

 Ezra Taft Benson Dead at 94 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ezra Taft Benson, head of the Mormon Church since
1985, secretary of agriculture from 1953 to 1961 and a pugnacious
force in matters of church and state for much of his life, died Monday
at his home in Salt Lake City. Church officials said he had been
hospitalized briefly last week for congestive heart failure. He was
94.
</P>
<P>
Incapacitated since 1989 and unable to speak or, at times, to
recognize even close relatives, Benson spent his last years under the
24-hour care of nurses in his apartment across the street from church
headquarters. His last public appearance was at the funeral of his
wife of nearly 66 years, Flora Amussen Benson, in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The severity of his condition became public last year when one of
his grandsons, tired of what he said was a charade involving posed
pictures and letters signed by an automatic pen, denounced Mormon
leaders for participating in a deception. His grandfather's absence,
Steve Benson conceded, had made little difference in running the
church, whose bureaucracy he compared to that of the former Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
``To me, it was just further evidence of the systematic illness
that has affected the hierarchy of the church,'' said Benson, 39, a
Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist for the Arizona Republic. The
grandson, a sixth-generation Mormon, later left the church.
</P>
<P>
Benson became the 13th president, prophet, seer and revelator of
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1985, after the
death of Spencer W. Kimball. Presidents of the Mormon Church serve for
life.
</P>
<P>
He took over leadership of a church that was 156 years old and had
about 6 million members worldwide. During his administration, the
church membership grew to nearly 9 million, church spokesmen said.
</P>
<P>
Benson was president of the Boise (Idaho) stake, or district, of
the Mormon Church in the late 1930s and headed the Washington stake
from 1940 to 1943. He was chosen as a member of the Council of Twelve
Apostles, the church's ruling group, in 1943. Three years later, he
became president of the church's European Mission, headquartered in
London. When he was appointed agriculture secretary, he took a leave
of absence from his duties as eighth-ranking church apostle.
</P>
<P>
After leaving government service in 1961, he devoted his life to
church work full time. Yet he did not become a stranger to
controversy. He spoke out on a variety of social and political
questions. He attacked the civil rights movement as advancing
communism, called the graduated income tax ``Marxist,'' attacked
detente with the Soviet Union, lambasted the women's movement and
became closely associated with members of the reactionary John Birch
Society.
</P>
<P>
When he became church president in 1985, many observers wondered
whether the Mormon Church would take a turn to the political right and
whether Benson, who had been restrained in his comments in recent
years, would begin to speak out again on political issues.
</P>
<P>
When he took office, Benson expressed love for ``every creed, color
and political persuasion.''
</P>
<P>
``Some have expectantly inquired about the direction the church
will take in the future,'' he said. ``May we suggest that the Lord,
through President Kimball, has sharply focused on the threefold
mission of the church: to preach the gospel, to perfect the saints and
to redeem the dead. We shall continue every effort to carry out this
mission.''
</P>
<P>
During his years as agriculture secretary, Benson opposed increases
in parity payments, intended to ensure farmers stable prices for
crops. He also opposed soil bank schemes, which would pay farmers for
cutting production, saying he was dead against paying farmers for
doing nothing.
</P>
<P>
In the spring of 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower was forced to
take measures to bolster falling hog prices, after protests from
Republican members of Congress representing the Midwest farm vote.
Benson opposed measures to help those small farmers, saying the
farmers were inefficient and the government should not pay to bail
them out.
</P>
<P>
But members of Congress pointed out just how crucial the farm vote
could be in a presidential election year, and farmers got what they
wanted. Benson's image as a foe of many small farmers was bolstered
when he was battered by eggs thrown at him during a speaking
engagement in South Dakota. Another time, Democrats on the Senate
Agriculture Committee hectored him so persistently that it took him 90
minutes to get through three pages of testimony.
</P>
<P>
Authorities say one measure of his unpopularity among farmers was
the steady loss of Republican votes in congressional elections in farm
states during the 1950s. Another measure was the sure-fire success
with farm crowds of Democrats campaigning for the presidency in 1960
when they promised that, if elected, they would fire Ezra Taft Benson.
</P>
<P>
Benson is survived by six children.

 Muhammad Assailant Was Well-Armed Former Islam Minister (Riverside) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
RIVERSIDE, Calif.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Nation of Islam minister who clashed
with fellow Muslims had a small arsenal, including a hunting rifle
with a scope, when he allegedly shot black nationalist Khallid Abdul
Muhammad and five other men outside a university auditorium,
authorities said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The suspect, identified as James Edward Bess, 49, opened fire just
after Muhammad finished a speech on the University of California
campus.
</P>
<P>
Khallid Muhammad -- a former Nation of Islam spokesman known for his
fiery anti-Jewish, anti-white rhetoric -- was shot in the legs. He and
a bodyguard were reported in stable condition. Four other bodyguards
were treated and released.
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement authorities said they have not ruled out a
conspiracy in the shooting, but they believe Bess was acting alone.
Investigators have not offered a motive.
</P>
<P>
People familiar with the suspect described Bess as a contentious
figure and a devotee of Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. Bess
had been removed from his post as a leader of the Seattle area mosque.
</P>
<P>
He once wrote an open letter in a black community newspaper
criticizing the mayor of Seattle for denouncing remarks by Farrakhan.
</P>
<P>
And, on another occasion, he told television viewers in Seattle,
where he frequently appeared on public access TV, that violence was
the way to deal with black leaders who let down the black community.
</P>
<P>
``If this false leadership continues I won't be surprised to see
the same thing as happened in South Africa, where the black woman was
hacked to death with a axe and ... thrown on a fire and burned up,''
Bess said. ``Matter of fact, I think that's what needs to take place
with this leadership. They ought to be doused with gasoline and burned
in public.''
</P>
<P>
A former top aide to Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan,
Muhammad had been one of Farrakhan's most vituperative lieutenants
until a verbal assault on Jews, Arabs and whites provoked
denunciations by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, black members of Congress and
President Clinton and led to his suspension.
</P>
<P>
Despite his suspension, Muhammad has publicly remained so loyal to
Farrakhan that many wonder if he continues to speak for Farrakhan. He
says only that they remain in contact but adds, ``We don't have the
closeness that we had. We don't have the communication that we used
to.''
</P>
<P>
Muhammad had come to Riverside to make the second of two speeches
in the Los Angeles area over the weekend (Riverside is about 60 miles
east of Los Angeles.)
</P>
<P>
The shooting Sunday night occurred despite tight security inside
the University of California, Riverside, auditorium during his
two-hour speech. The 500 members of the audience were frisked as they
entered the room. In addition to two city police officers, about 50
members of the Fruit of Islam -- the security arm of the nation of
Islam -- were present.
</P>
<P>
Muhammad drew cheers during his speech when he described whites as
satanic and Jews as oppressors. In a speech in Los Angeles Saturday,
Muhammad referred to Jews as ``bagel-eating'' and ``hook nosed'' and
contended that ``the black holocaust is 100 times worse than any other
holocaust''.
</P>
<P>
But police and university spokesmen spokesman said that security
personnel were caught by surprise when Muhammad left the podium and
said he would continue to field questions outside. Muhammad said he
was going outdoors because he had been told -- apparently in error -- 
that the sponsoring organization had to give up the gymnasium or pay
additional costs.
</P>
<P>
University officials acknowledged they were apprehensive about
Muhammad's speech on campus, sponsored by the African Student
Alliance, but said that to have blocked the talk would have been a
denial of free speech.
</P>
<P>
When he came outside, Muhammad, 43, was hit in both legs by shots
fired from a 9-mm handgun. One bodyguard, Cakliph Saduik, 33, was shot
in the upper right back. Another guard, Barnado Puckett, 34, was shot
three times. Terrell D. Strait, 20, was shot in the left shoulder and
stomach. Steve L. Washington received a minor gunshot injury, and
Thomas L. Harri had a minor gunshot graze to the back.
</P>
<P>
Bess was was severely beaten by a crowd of people who had witnessed
the shooting. Authorities said he suffered a fractured shoulder,
multiple abrasions and lost teeth.
</P>
<P>
Riverside police reported Monday that they confiscated not only the
9-mm handgun alleged used in the shooting, but also found a backpack
containing two other guns and a hunting rifle in Bess' car which was
parked nearby.
</P>
<P>
(Optional Add End)
</P>
<P>
By Monday afternoon, Muhammad had gotten out of his hospital bed
and was walking around his room, according to Nation of Islam security
guards who declined to identify themselves.
</P>
<P>
``He is fine. His spirits are fine,'' said a woman who identified
herself as Muhammad's sister at Riverside Community Hospital Monday
afternoon. ``He's just tired. Doing his father's work makes him
tired,'' said the woman who would not give her name but was sitting in
a room beside Muhammad's 9-year-old son in the hospital's intensive
care wing.
</P>
<P>
One knowledgeable source told the Los Angeles Times that Bess was
suspended about three years ago from his post as minister of a mosque
in Seattle by a former Nation of Islam minister and official, Wazir
Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
A resident of Los Angeles, Wazir Muhammad was said to be with
Khallid Muhammad during the speech but not at his side when the
shooting took place.

 Rostenkowski Decides to Fight Fraud, Abuse of Office Charges (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., said Monday that he has chosen to fight charges
of fraud and abuse of his public office, rather than making a deal
with federal prosecutors to plead guilty to lesser offenses.
</P>
<P>
``I have always fought for what I believe in. I strongly believe
that I am not guilty of these charges, and will fight to regain my
reputation in court,'' Rostenkowski said in a statement issued Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came on the eve of Tuesday's deadline by the government
to accept or reject its plea-bargain offer. ``That is a far more
attractive option than pleading guilty to crimes that I did not
commit,'' Rostenkowski said.

 U.N. Appeals to N. Korea to Let Inspectors In 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Security Council issued an appeal to North Korea Monday night
to allow the international nuclear agency to monitor the discharge of
fuel from a reactor.
</P>
<P>
The non-binding statement, which had the crucial support of China,
did not include any explicit threat of sanctions against North Korea
for violating nuclear safeguards. But diplomats said the measure would
likely be the last the Security Council will take before considering
sanctions, if North Korea continues to unload fuel from the Yongbyon
reactor without oversight by the International Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
IAEA Director General Hans Blix reported Friday that North Korea
had accelerated the unsupervised discharge of fuel and was only days
away from making it impossible for the IAEA to determine whether fuel
from the reactor had been diverted secretly in the past, perhaps for
weapons.
</P>
<P>
If North Korea does not halt the fuel discharge, it will spell the
failure of more than a year of efforts by the Clinton administration
to use dialogue to bring the Communist regime in Pyongyang back into
line with nuclear safeguards. ``We are perilously close to the
precipice,'' a U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
The statement ``strongly urges'' North Korea to continue unloading
thousands of spent fuel rods ``in a manner which preserves the
technical possibility'' of measuring nuclear materials according to
IAEA procedures. It calls for new talks between Pyongyang and the IAEA
and asks the agency to leave two inspectors in the country. An IAEA
official left North Korea on Friday after talks on inspections failed.
</P>
<P>
The United States opted for a ``last-minute appeal rather than a
warning,'' a U.S. official said, to secure the cooperation of China
before the council is forced to debate punitive sanctions. Beijing has
been opposed to sanctions and will probably abstain on any resolution.
North Korea has said it would view sanctions as an act of war.
</P>
<P>
The IAEA has said that so far North Korea did not appear to be
diverting fuel from recently removed fuel rods. But it needs to take
samples from a range of the unloaded rods to determine whether any
fuel was removed from the reactor in years past. The used fuel can be
reprocessed to make weapons-grade plutonium.

 Adding details of Muhammad's condition and other changes throughout 
 Muhammad Assailant Was Well-Armed Former Islam Minister (Riverside) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
RIVERSIDE, Calif.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Nation of Islam minister who clashed
with fellow Muslims had a small arsenal, including a hunting rifle
with a scope, when he allegedly shot black nationalist Khallid Abdul
Muhammad and five other men outside a university auditorium,
authorities said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The suspect, identified as James Edward Bess, 49, opened fire just
after Muhammad finished a speech on the University of California
campus here Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Muhammad -- a former Nation of Islam spokesman known for his fiery
anti-Jewish, anti-white rhetoric -- was shot in the legs. He and a
bodyguard were reported in stable condition. Four other bodyguards
were treated and released.
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement authorities said they have not ruled out a
conspiracy in the shooting but they believe Bess, a Tacoma, Wash,
resident who was booked on several counts of attempted murder, was
acting alone. Investigators have not offered a motive.
</P>
<P>
People familiar with the suspect described Bess as a devotee of
Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan and a contentious figure who
was removed from his post as a leader of the Seattle-area mosque.
</P>
<P>
He once wrote an open letter in a black community newspaper
criticizing the mayor of Seattle for denouncing remarks by Farrakhan.
</P>
<P>
And, on another occasion, he told viewers of a public access
television station in Seattle that violence was the way to deal with
black leaders who let down the black community.
</P>
<P>
``If this false leadership continues I won't be surprised to see
the same thing as happened in South Africa, where the black woman was
hacked to death with a ax and ... thrown on a fire and burned up,''
Bess said on a 1985 tape aired by ABC and CBS. ``Matter of fact, I
think that's what needs to take place with this leadership. They ought
to be doused with gasoline and burned in public.''
</P>
<P>
A former top aide to Farrakhan, Muhammad had been one of
Farrakhan's most vituperative lieutenants until a verbal assault on
Jews, Arabs and whites provoked denunciations by the Rev. Jesse
Jackson, black members of Congress and President Clinton, leading to
his suspension.
</P>
<P>
Despite his suspension, Muhammad has remained so publicly loyal to
Farrakhan that many wonder if he continues to speak for Farrakhan. He
says only that they remain in contact but adds, ``We don't have the
closeness that we had. We don't have the communication that we used
to.''
</P>
<P>
Muhammad had come to Riverside to make the second of two speeches
in the Los Angeles area over the weekend. (Riverside is about 60 miles
east of Los Angeles.)
</P>
<P>
The shooting Sunday night occurred despite tight security inside
the University of California, Riverside, auditorium during his
two-hour speech. The 500 members of the audience were frisked as they
entered the room. In addition to two city police officers, about 50
members of the Fruit of Islam -- the security arm of the Nation of
Islam -- were present.
</P>
<P>
Muhammad drew cheers during his speech when he described whites as
satanic and Jews as oppressors. In a speech Saturday in Los Angeles,
Muhammad referred to Jews as ``bagel-eating'' and ``hook-nosed'' and
contended that ``the black holocaust is 100 times worse than any other
holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
Police and university spokesmen said that security personnel were
caught by surprise when Muhammad left the podium and said he would
continue to field questions outside. Muhammad said he was going
outdoors because he had been told -- apparently in error -- that the
sponsoring organization had to give up the gymnasium or pay additional
costs.
</P>
<P>
University officials acknowledged that they were apprehensive about
Muhammad's speech on campus, sponsored by the African Student
Alliance, but said that to have blocked the talk would have been a
denial of free speech.
</P>
<P>
When he came outside, Muhammad, 43, was hit in both legs by shots
fired from a 9-mm handgun. One bodyguard, Varnardo Puckett, 34, of
Pomona, remained hospitalized with three wounds. Caliph Sadiq, 33, was
shot in the upper right back. Terrell D. Strait, 20, was shot in the
left shoulder and stomach. Steve L. Washington received a minor
gunshot injury, and Thomas L. Harri had a minor gunshot graze to the
back.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
By Monday afternoon, Muhammad had gotten out of his hospital bed
and was walking around his room, according to Nation of Islam security
guards who declined to identify themselves.
</P>
<P>
``He is fine. His spirits are fine,'' said a woman who identified
herself as Muhammad's sister at Riverside Community Hospital Monday
afternoon. ``He's just tired. Doing his father's work makes him
tired,'' said the woman who would not give her name but was sitting in
a room beside Muhammad's 9-year-old son in the hospital's intensive
care wing.
</P>
<P>
One visitor said that Muhammad was grateful for the bodyguards who
took bullets for him: ``He said, `If it wasn't for (them) I wouldn't
be here.''
</P>
<P>
While Fruit of Islam members guarded his hospital room, Muhammad
received a steady stream of visitors, including his 9-year-old son,
Farrakhan, and other family members. He also reportedly talked to
Louis Farrakhan on the telephone.
</P>
<P>
As of late Monday, the Nation of Islam had released no statement
regarding the shooting.
</P>
<P>
Bess was severely beaten by a crowd of people who had witnessed the
shooting. Authorities said he suffered a fractured shoulder, multiple
abrasions and lost some teeth. He remained hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
Riverside police reported Monday that they confiscated not only the
handgun allegedly used in the shooting, but also found a backpack
containing two other guns and a hunting rifle in Bess's car, which was
parked nearby.
</P>
<P>
One knowledgeable source told the Los Angeles Times that Bess was
removed about three years ago from his post as minister of a mosque in
Seattle by a former Nation of Islam minister and official, Wazir
Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
A resident of Los Angeles, Wazir Muhammad was said to be with
Khallid Muhammad during the speech but not at his side when the
shooting took place.

 Whitewater Likely to Haunt Clinton Again During Summer 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just when President Clinton thought it was safe to focus on his
health care agenda, Whitewater may come back to haunt him again.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two months, the controversial land deal faded from
the front page as journalists second-guessed their frenzied coverage
and congressional leaders delayed holding hearings so as not to
interfere with ongoing grand jury investigations.
</P>
<P>
But after a visit to Capitol Hill Thursday by Special Counsel
Robert Fiske Jr., lawmakers now say they may begin calling witnesses
as early as July, bringing the issue that Clinton and his wife,
Hillary Rodham Clinton, have fought so hard to kill back to life.
</P>
<P>
Fiske said that by the ``middle to the end of June,'' he would
complete the portion of his investigation that relates to the death of
Deputy White House Counsel Vincent Foster and possibly improper
contacts between Clinton administration officials and government
regulators concerning the failed Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan in
Arkansas. Fiske said that at that point, he would tell lawmakers if he
objected to hearings on those subjects.
</P>
<P>
Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., under mounting Republican pressure,
responded that the House could then hold hearings beginning in late
July or early August. And Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, who has been exchanging hearing proposals with Minority
Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., grudgingly agreed.
</P>
<P>
``We all know what is going on,'' Mitchell complained earlier.
``This is raw partisan politics ....''
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers from both sides generally agree it is likely that
hearings will be held sometime this summer. But they say that the
proceedings probably will be narrowly proscribed and tightly
controlled by the dominant Democrats, who will keep a tight rein on
information that reflects badly on the president.
</P>
<P>
In the House, Foley said he wants the Banking Committee to hold the
hearings while his nemesis, Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., is
calling for the creation of a special select committee to investigate.

 Kathleen Brown Aims Message at Working Women (San Diego) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SAN DIEGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reveling in her keynote role at a recent conference of
500 women lawyers, Kathleen Brown effortlessly established common
ground with professionals juggling work, families and careers.
</P>
<P>
``We all know that housework, if done right, can kill you,''
quipped the California state treasurer and Democratic gubernatorial
candidate. Her post-feminist advice that day: ``We can have it all, so
long as we don't try to have it all at once.''
</P>
<P>
Elegant but down-to-earth, Brown, 48, was delivering a message she
has lived. Her father, former California Gov. Edmund G. ``Pat'' Brown,
has called her ``the real politician in the family'' -- high praise,
considering that her brother Jerry, 56, also served two Sacramento
terms and made three runs for president. But suppressing her own
political ambitions, Kathleen Brown raised three children; she has
twin 2-year-old grandchildren. In her second marriage, to TV news
executive Van Gordon Sauter, she detoured to New York as a corporate
wife and Fordham law student before returning west to claim her
political heritage.
</P>
<P>
She won the treasurer's job in 1990. Her only previous government
service was on the Los Angeles school board in the 1970s and the city
public works commission a decade later. She has been forced to combat
a perceived lack of executive experience.
</P>
<P>
In the June 7 primary, she faces state insurance commissioner John
Garamendi and State Sen. Tom Hayden. Brown until recently concentrated
on fund-raising and TV ads instead of stump speaking.
</P>
<P>
But her commercials misfired. In one, she slammed Republican Gov.
Pete Wilson, whom she hopes to run against, for paroling a serial
rapist. He slammed back, contending that the mandates of a judge
appointed by her father and a parole law signed by her brother left
him no choice.
</P>
<P>
Brown finally unveiled a focused message at the state Democratic
convention in Los Angeles last month. Her theme is ``1 million new
jobs'' for Californians in the next four years.
</P>
<P>
``My goal is to keep the voters' attention on jobs and the
economy,'' Brown said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
What about her brother? Unfavorably recalled by many Californians
as a flake, Jerry Brown is praising Hayden and refusing to endorse his
sister on his syndicated radio show, saying ``I have more radical
views'' than anybody running. He's even said voters are getting
``bamboozled'' by her and Wilson alike.
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Brown laughs it off. ``Jerry's being Jerry,'' she said.

 ON MARKETING: Sunglass Manufacturers Cash in on the Culture of Cool 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
America has become a sunglass culture. A society of shades, if you
will.
</P>
<P>
At one time, marketers convinced us that we can make bold
statements about ourselves by the brand of soda pop we drank -- or the
sneakers we wore. But now, it is those dark spectacles on our noses
that tell all. Sunglass makers are making a killing on our mass desire
to look cool.
</P>
<P>
And for all of today's talk about ultraviolet sun protection,
consumer psychologists say that when we slip into our $275 Revos, we
are mostly protecting ourselves from looking ordinary.
</P>
<P>
Just as athletic shoe makers convinced us that we need $100 tennis
shoes -- and a different sneaker for every sport -- the sunglass
industry is now spurring its own growth by persuading us that we need
different sunglasses while driving the car, steering the boat or
competing in the Iditarod.
</P>
<P>
``It's all about imagery,'' said Marge Axelrad, editorial director
of the trade publication 20/20. ``Fashion and styling have never been
more important.''
</P>
<P>
Nothing -- absolutely nothing -- sells sunglasses like style.
``Ultimately, you buy a pair of sunglasses because you think they look
good on your face,'' said Jeff Turner, general manager of Nikon Inc.'s
eye wear division, which is running ads that nudge consumers to buy
several pair of its performance glasses for different activities.
</P>
<P>
This is prime sunglass season. Between Memorial Day and the Fourth
of July, sunglass makers expect to peddle nearly 60 percent of the
estimated $2.5 billion in non-prescription sunglasses that will be
sold this year.
</P>
<P>
California reigns as the nation's sunglass capital. By one
estimate, nearly 25 percent of all sunglasses sold in 1994 will be
sold in California. Although flea markets -- and tourist attractions -- 
sell lots of low-end glasses for under $10, the big-ticket sunglasses
for over $100 are increasingly being bought at sunglass specialty
stores.
</P>
<P>
While sales of all sunglasses jumped 14.6 percent last year, sales
of upper-end sunglasses (those over $30) were up nearly 17 percent,
according to Bausch Lomb. Manufacturers say that smaller, geometric
metal frames are among today's most popular designs.
</P>
<P>
For $330, you can pick up a pair of fancy Serengeti sunglasses
guaranteed to cut reflective glare from water, snow or your
$120-an-hour tennis pro's metal racquet.
</P>
<P>
And if your 8-year-old needs a new set of shades -- because the last
pair ended up getting flushed down the toilet -- Bausch Lomb has just
introduced its new ``Covers'' line of sunglasses that, for $30 a pop,
come with a kiddie neck cord to avoid immediate loss.
</P>
<P>
Sunglass industry executives concede the current sunglass mania was
carefully carved out by manufacturers -- many of which pay celebrities
to wear their shades. ``All of this has been greatly enhanced by
marketing,'' said Jim Pritts, president of the Sunglass Association of
America.
</P>
<P>
Every time some major Hollywood hunk slips into a new pair of
shades on screen, sales of the brand tend to skyrocket. Tom Cruise
sent Ray-Ban sales through the roof when he wore them in ``Risky
Business.'' Ditto for Arnold Schwarzenegger and his too-cool Ray-Ban
``Baloramas'' in ``Terminator 2.'' And the film ``Blues Brothers''
caused a run on Ray-Ban's thick-framed ``Wayfayer'' sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
Jackie Kennedy Onassis made over-sized sunglasses the craze among
the over-40 set for years -- although few realized that her designer
frames were actually prescription sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
Bausch Lomb pays baseball slugger Frank Thomas to don its outer
space-like ``Killer Loop'' glasses. Oakley Inc., which virtually owns
the so-called ``performance'' segment of sunglasses, has Winter
Olympic gold medalists Bonnie Blair and Dan Jansen wearing its brand.
Serengeti pays A.J. Foyt to slips on its shades. And Revo has Reggie
Jackson in its glasses.
</P>
<P>
Reebok has just begun trying to do with sunglasses what it did with
athletic shoes. But the company finds it can't coax its big-name
athletes to wear its shades because most already have deals with other
companies, said Marty Blue, director of licensing. Thomas is with
Bausch Lomb, as is Olympic skater Nancy Kerrigan, who wears the
company's Ray-Ban line.
</P>
<P>
Foster-Grant, a company that once ruled the industry, resurfaced
over the weekend with its first national TV ad campaign in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The company, which makes lower-end sunglasses (under $30 a pair),
was king of the sunglass market in the 1960s and 1970s. But after
years of mismanagement, it sought protection from creditors in 1988
when it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Recently, Foster-Grant was
purchased by Rye, N.Y.-based Benson Eyecare Corp., which is about to
spend millions to re-establish the brand.
</P>
<P>
Over Memorial Day Weekend, Foster-Grant began airing a new ad that
features its 30-year-old slogan, ``Who's that behind those
Foster-Grants?''
</P>
<P>
``Brand awareness is incredibly strong,'' said Ken Shaw, senior
vice president of sales. Indeed, Foster-Grant tested its slogan among
groups of consumers and discovered that 35- to 54-year-olds were as
familiar with that line as the slogan, ``Look who's squeezing the
Charmin.''
</P>
<P>
By next year, Foster-Grant may try to introduce a line of
higher-end sunglasses, Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
Cashing in on the high-end sunglass craze is the Sunglass Hut
chain, which has nearly 750 stores nationwide. It will also expand
into several European countries this year, said Jack B. Chadsey,
president of the Coral Gables, Fla.-based chain.
</P>
<P>
``It all boils down to lifestyle,'' said Chadsey, who said the
typical sunglass customer will own 30 pair of sunglasses over a
lifetime. ``We all sit on our sunglasses, drop them or leave them
sitting on the table in the restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
Today, the typical customer spends $77 on sunglasses at Sunglass
Hut, Chadsey said. To improve its bottom line, the firm recently
developed its own private-label line, SunGear.
</P>
<P>
Also trying to cut in on that action is the giant LensCrafters
optical chain. In five test markets, LensCrafters is linking up with
the Sunglass Hut chain by offering discounts to Sunglass Hut
customers.
</P>
<P>
Behind the current sunglass craze is a simple cry for attention by
many people who wear them. ``It's the upscale equivalent of the
tattoo,'' said psychologist Dr. Joyce Brothers. ``Wearing sunglasses
may be the last bit of lure that we have left.''

 RENO AT LARGE: Unions Finally Have Their Day 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The shellacking unions took on NAFTA last year could soon be
avenged by passage of the most important piece of pro-labor
legislation since the Wagner Act of 1935.
</P>
<P>
This is amazing since this is not 1935, union membership has been
declining for more than a decade, we have a centrist presidency
disposed to ingratiate itself with the business community and the
Congress is heavily infested with ``new'' Democrats, old Republicans
and Reaganite new Neanderthals. What gives?
</P>
<P>
Well, the Anti-Striker Replacement Act has already achieved clear
majorities in both houses. And it will come to the floor of the Senate
this summer with only the promise of a filibuster between it and final
passage. It may take but a few compromises to win the 60 votes
necessary to shut off the gaseous debate and get the measure signed.
</P>
<P>
The usual suspects are bellowing ludicrous warnings that the bill
is an invitation to American workers to stage an immediate
re-enactment of Paris in the Terror enforced by an epidemic of strikes
and the brutalization of their less militant comrades.
</P>
<P>
Given the current condition of organized labor and the global
mobility of manufacturing, these are hardly realistic fears. There
were only 35 major strikes in all the United States last year. There
haven't been more than 100 strikes in any year since 1981. In 1979
there were 235 strikes. In 1974, 424.
</P>
<P>
One reason is the decline in union membership. Another is the
wretched example Ronald Reagan set in 1981 by firing all the air
traffic controllers who had the temerity to strike in protest to
working conditions of appalling stress. Another is increasing global
competition and the ease with which U.S. companies can transfer
operations overseas.
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reasons, the results have not been very pretty. The
decline of the unions and in the level of strike activity has moved in
lock step with stagnation of blue collar wages, an explosion in
individual wrongful dismissal litigation by workers with no unions to
defend them, sharp declines in the percentage of companies offering
pension and health care benefits, the overall redistribution of income
to the benefit of the wealthy, less job security and huge increases in
part-time and temporary jobs as a percentage of total employment.
America with weakened unions is simply not a nicer place unless, of
course, you are the CEO of a major corporation whose annual
compensation has been rising obscenely over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
Miraculously, this seems to have sunk in with a majority in
Congress including more than a few members not normally to be found on
the side of organized labor. Even among a number of conservative
economists, especially those who applaud labor's recent tendency
toward greater cooperation with management on productivity issues,
there is an increasing sense that the nation has lost something
essential to social fairness -- something, well, American -- by tilting
the industrial playing field too far to labor's disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
Besides, in an era where it is increasingly fashionable to
disparage those who don't work -- even when there are no jobs for them
 -- it is finally occurring even to some of the cement heads in Congress
that it would be nice for a change to do something decent for those
who do.

 Palestinian Police Accused of Militant's Secret Arrest (Gaza) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
GAZA, Gaza Strip
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hani Abed has disappeared, last seen in the
hands of the Palestinian police.
</P>
<P>
Abed, a 31-year-old university teacher, may be the first secret
arrest -- and perhaps first political arrest -- by the new Palestinian
authority in the Gaza Strip, who took over from Israel two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
``If the police do things like this, for sure there will be a
revolution,'' said his angry sister, Atimad Abed.
</P>
<P>
Abed is a man with the wrong kind of friends: for certain,
opponents of the peace process, and maybe -- or maybe not -- murderers
from the Muslim group Islamic Jihad.
</P>
<P>
Because of that, the Palestinian police took him away last Tuesday.
They have held him without charges, without explanation, and without
admitting they have him.
</P>
<P>
Suddenly everybody wants him. Israelis have demanded he be turned
over to them and questioned about a May 20 attack that killed two
soldiers. Islamic Jihad wants him freed. And his family wants to see
him, just to find out where he is.
</P>
<P>
``This is a very dangerous crime, a stupid crime, to kidnap our
brother Hani Abed,'' said a leaflet published Friday by Islamic Jihad,
one of the most strident criticisms yet of the new Palestinian police.
It warned: ``We will not be silent.''
</P>
<P>
Abed's surreptitious arrest -- he was lured to police headquarters
with a false story -- and his confinement without charges may have
far-reaching implications.
</P>
<P>
It is an ominous signal for Palestinians who had hoped they had
seen the end of midnight arrests common under the Israeli military
occupation. The incoming police had promised to protect civil rights.
</P>
<P>
It may also signal the methods that will be used by the police,
loyal to the Fatah branch of the Palestine Liberation Organization, to
deal with opposition Palestinian groups.
</P>
<P>
And it may determine how the new authorities will deal with Israeli
demands that the police turn over Palestinian suspects in attacks on
Israelis. The Palestinians so far have not made clear how they will
answer that demand.
</P>
<P>
Because of those implications, both Israel and the new Palestinian
authority are remaining publicly mum about the case.
</P>
<P>
Israel apparently is interested in Abed in relation to a drive-by
shooting at a Gaza Strip checkpoint May 20 in which two Israeli
soldiers were killed. The gunmen fled toward Gaza City, and Islamic
Jihad later claimed responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
It is uncertain what, if anything, Abed knows of the attack.
</P>
<P>
Abed is a chemistry teacher at the Science and Technology College
in Gaza. Married, with four children, he works a second job in a press
office in Gaza known to be affiliated with the Islamic Jihad.
</P>
<P>
According to his family, throughout the Israeli occupation he was
never arrested for Islamic Jihad activities. Like most Palestinian
groups, the Islamic Jihad is divided into its armed ``military'' wing
and its political wing. Abed's contacts were with the political wing,
his family claimed.
</P>
<P>
Last week, men in plainclothes saying they were from the
Palestinian police visited his home six times. They said a new
Palestinian arrival who was a relative wanted to meet Abed. When he
went to inquire, he was taken into custody.
</P>
<P>
(Optional Add End)
</P>
<P>
When his family demanded to know his whereabouts, the chief of the
Palestinian Police, Maj. Gen. Nasser Yusef, told them it was a
``secret,'' according to his brothers, Awni Abed, 20, and Amad Abed,
29.
</P>
<P>
Then they were told their brother was being kept in confinement for
his protection from Israeli collaborators, they said. Finally, three
days ago, the family stayed at the entrance to the Gaza Central
Prison, causing a commotion and demanding to see Abed.
</P>
<P>
The prison was notorious during the Israeli occupation for its
confinement of Palestinians and was ``liberated'' with great
celebration by Palestinians when the Israelis withdrew from Gaza May
18.
</P>
<P>
Abed's mother, Najiba, said her son was escorted from the prison to
see her for just a moment to assure her he was OK. She has not heard
from him since that short Saturday visit, she said.
</P>
<P>
``If the Israelis arrested him for 20 years, I could accept it,''
said Amad Abed. ``But for the Palestinians to arrest him and put him
in that jail is crazy.''

 U.S. Wades Into Sudan Conflict (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not content with trying to broker peace between Israel
and Syria and head off nuclear confrontation between India and
Pakistan, the Clinton administration is wading into another seemingly
intractable conflict, the civil war in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Melissa F. Wells, President Clinton's new special representative on
Sudan, is going to Africa this week for exploratory conversations with
Sudanese rebels and the governments of several neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
No one thinks she can bring about a solution to a war that has
raged on and off for nearly four decades, State Department officials
said last week, but with millions of Sudanese on the brink of
starvation and the conflict threatening to spill over into adjacent
countries it has become necessary to try to do something.
</P>
<P>
In many ways, Wells's mission reflects perfectly the foreign policy
strategy of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
On one level, Sudan is the very definition of a country where the
United States has few important interests. But it has a high priority
in terms of the issues deemed important by the administration:
humanitarian concerns; the promotion of democracy and regional
stability; prevention of terrorism; the conflict between extremist
Islam and the secular state.
</P>
<P>
Wells is one of several special envoys the administration has
dispatched to chronic points of conflict, including Cyprus and Angola,
in an effort to defuse regional tensions and promote human rights.
</P>
<P>
``The international community has never been able to deal with
Sudan effectively,'' a State Department official said last week.
Well's mission ``brings American interest to bear on the problem,
right up to the level of a presidential appointee. We believe we have
the president's attention on this. But it may not be soluble.''
</P>
<P>
Wells is a respected career diplomat who has spent much of her
adult life in Africa, including tours as ambassador to Zaire and
Mozambique. But it is hard to imagine that any of her previous
assignments was tougher than the current one.
</P>
<P>
Sudan, the largest country in Africa, is an impoverished, thinly
populated land ravaged by war, disease and drought. Its government -- a
military dictatorship dominated by Islamic militants and allied with
Iran -- has been branded a supporter of international terrorism by the
State Department. Clinton's national security adviser, Anthony Lake,
recently added it to his list of ``reactionary backlash states.''
</P>
<P>
According to a May 24 report by the U.S. Agency for International
Development, about 392,000 of Sudan's 28 million people are refugees
in neighboring countries. A larger number are living in refugee camps
within Sudan, dependent for food on international relief missions that
are frequently disrupted by the war.
</P>
<P>
Many people are eating wild roots and leaves, the AID report said.
In the Bahr al Ghazal region, ``practically all the trees are picked
clean, because the population has resorted to eating leaves and
bark.'' The World Health Organization reported 102,000 deaths from
malaria in 1993, but also said that AIDS is spreading so fast in the
southern part of the country that it will overtake malaria as a killer
this year.
</P>
<P>
The cause of most of this misery is a war that began in 1955, went
on until 1972 and resumed in 1983. Generally described as pitting the
Muslim, Arab north against the non-Muslim, African south, it has
recently grown more complicated because factions among the southern
rebels have been fighting each other.
</P>
<P>
The south, which wants autonomy and refuses to abide by the Islamic
law imposed by the north, ``has been totally ravaged by the war,''
Sudanese scholar Francis M. Deng told a Washington Symposium sponsored
by the United States Institute of Peace.
</P>
<P>
``There is no infrastructure worth the term,'' Deng said. ``A
generation is growing up without education, and millions have been
displaced in their own country or forced into refuge abroad. Cohesive
cultures that have been studied and assumed to be stable and enduring
are now being wiped out.''
</P>
<P>
On her first trip to East Africa as special envoy, Wells will sound
out the prospects for reviving regional peace talks and for expediting
the flow of relief aid, State Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
No political solution, end to the war or reconciliation between
Washington and Khartoum is in sight, officials said. United Nations
ambassador Madeline Albright went to Khartoum April 1 to tell
President Omar Hassan Bashir that ``we were not going to welcome them
into the international community until they totally changed their
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
But State Department analysts were intrigued by a recent interview
Sudanese foreign minister Hussein Suleiman Abu Saleh gave to the
Christian Science Monitor. Abu Saleh was quoted as saying Sudan would
welcome western ``technical know-how`` in drafting a power-sharing
plan for the government and the rebels.

 RENO AT LARGE: Unions Finally Have Their Day 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The shellacking unions took on NAFTA last year could soon be
avenged by passage of the most important piece of pro-labor
legislation since the Wagner Act of 1935.
</P>
<P>
This is amazing since this is not 1935, union membership has been
declining for more than a decade, we have a centrist presidency
disposed to ingratiate itself with the business community and the
Congress is heavily infested with ``new'' Democrats, old Republicans
and Reaganite new Neanderthals. What gives?
</P>
<P>
Well, the Anti-Striker Replacement Act has already achieved clear
majorities in both houses. And it will come to the floor of the Senate
this summer with only the promise of a filibuster between it and final
passage. It may take but a few compromises to win the 60 votes
necessary to shut off the gaseous debate and get the measure signed.
</P>
<P>
The usual suspects are bellowing ludicrous warnings that the bill
is an invitation to American workers to stage an immediate
re-enactment of Paris in the Terror enforced by an epidemic of strikes
and the brutalization of their less militant comrades.
</P>
<P>
Given the current condition of organized labor and the global
mobility of manufacturing, these are hardly realistic fears. There
were only 35 major strikes in all the United States last year. There
haven't been more than 100 strikes in any year since 1981. In 1979
there were 235 strikes. In 1974, 424.
</P>
<P>
One reason is the decline in union membership. Another is the
wretched example Ronald Reagan set in 1981 by firing all the air
traffic controllers who had the temerity to strike in protest to
working conditions of appalling stress. Another is increasing global
competition and the ease with which U.S. companies can transfer
operations overseas.
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reasons, the results have not been very pretty. The
decline of the unions and in the level of strike activity has moved in
lock step with stagnation of blue collar wages, an explosion in
individual wrongful dismissal litigation by workers with no unions to
defend them, sharp declines in the percentage of companies offering
pension and health care benefits, the overall redistribution of income
to the benefit of the wealthy, less job security and huge increases in
part-time and temporary jobs as a percentage of total employment.
America with weakened unions is simply not a nicer place unless, of
course, you are the CEO of a major corporation whose annual
compensation has been rising obscenely over the last decade.

Miraculously, this seems to have sunk in with a majority in

 World Cup Sponsors Gamble on Soccer's Questionable U.S. Popularity 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(c) 1994, Newsday 
</P>
<P>
World Cup sponsors are gambling $500 million on advertising rights
despite Americans' past indifference to the world's most popular
sport.
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola, Canon, McDonald's and Snickers candy bars are among the
19 businesses spending as much as $20 million each for sponsorship
rights to the soccer championships, which start next month. This is
the first time the World Cup will be played on American soil.
</P>
<P>
Time Warner, meanwhile, should make at least $35 million, according
to one analyst, from the licensing and merchandising rights to sales
of World Cup apparel and merchandise, which are expected to top $1
billion. More than 100 American companies have agreements with Time
Warner to produce World Cup merchandise.
</P>
<P>
The jury is out over whether all this money is well spent.
</P>
<P>
``These companies are more like pioneers than sponsors,'' said
Brandon Steiner of Steiner Sports Marketing, a Manhattan-based
consulting firm. ``One day soccer will be big in this country, but not
this year. You go out on the street and you stop 25 people, and I
guarantee 20 of them couldn't name a single sponsor. That's where the
World Cup is today.''
</P>
<P>
But do sponsors really have to win the hearts and minds of
Americans to succeed? Probably not. Most have a larger, worldwide
audience in mind.
</P>
<P>
``The attention of the sporting world will be focused on the World
Cup,'' said Robert Baskin, public relations director for Coca-Cola.
``The games are sold out. You can't book flights into the U.S. during
the finals. The World Cup is bigger than the Olympics, especially the
final games. The scale of this is going to be a real eye-opener for
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
In this country, ``it's a niche play,'' said Walter Staab, chairman
of SFM Media Corp., media buyers based in Manhattan. ``There are
certain segments of the population who love soccer and they could be
very much involved in the World Cup if it was marketed correctly.''
</P>
<P>
``There's an immense Hispanic audience that is slowly being tapped
into,'' says Bryan Murphy, publisher of the Westport, Conn.-based
Sports Marketing Newsletter. ``The sponsors will probably be very
happy if they keep in mind who's going to watch. The World Cup is not
going to draw everybody like the Super Bowl, but it'll draw a lot.''
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
The tournament will last from June 17 to July 17, with games played
at nine sites nationwide.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 1 million people nationwide are expected to attend the
games and spend $4 billion on hotels, restaurants, shopping and other
activities.
</P>
<P>
For sponsors, the games pose unusual challenges. Because soccer
doesn't have time-outs and game breaks like football or baseball,
World Cup TV broadcasters ABC and ESPN will show the games without
commercial interruptions. As part of an agreement between the
broadcasters, World Cup '94 and FIFA, the international soccer
federation, commercials will only be shown during the pre- and
post-game shows and at halftime. Names of the major sponsors will be
displayed in 9-minute intervals on top of a game clock in the lower
right hand corner of the screen.
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't mean there's any shortage of soccer-related
commercials and promotional tie-ins:
</P>
<P>
-- Soccer balls are flying in new TV spots by Coke and Adidas
(starring U.S. goalkeeper Tony Meola), among others, and in a contest
by Gillette and a soccer gear giveaway by Energizer batteries.
</P>
<P>
-- McDonald's is hosting a ``McSoccerfest'' tournament in the nine
host cities.
</P>
<P>
-- Wheaties boxes will offer trading cards with Reebok's soccer
endorsers.
</P>
<P>
-- General Motors will be the exclusive advertiser in a special World
Cup edition of Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
-- On July 16, the eve of the final match in Pasadena, Calif.,
Coca-Cola will run two hours of entertainment and commentary from the
World Cup games on TNT. Called ``Big TV,'' the telecast is similar to
one it made in conjunction with the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
The international and U.S. groups organizing the World Cup have
designated levels of sponsorship, including ``official sponsors,'' who
pay $17 million to $20 million for advertising rights, including
billboard space on the playing fields in full view of TV cameras
during the 52 games; ``marketing partners,'' who pay up to $10 million
for ads on one side of the World Cup playing fields, and a variety of
less expensive regional sponsorships. All together, the companies are
spending nearly $500 million.
</P>
<P>
In addition, each TV ``gold'' sponsor is rumored to have paid ABC
nearly $3.5 million for game exposure throughout the 52 matches and
for an undetermined number of 30-second spots during halftime and the
pre- and post-game shows. Lesser ``silver'' sponsors paid an estimated
$2 million to $2.5 million for a similar package that does not include
game exposure.
</P>
<P>
The World Cup's final game is expected to grab as many as 2 billion
viewers worldwide, compared with 750 million for the 1993 Super Bowl.
A ``gold' advertising package costing $3.5 million includes three
30-second TV spots per game over 52 games. That comes out to
approximately $22,000 per spot. By comparison, a 30-second spot during
last year's Super Bowl cost $900,000.

 Clinton Aims to Bolster Foreign Policy Reputation (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Clinton departs this week on the first of
two back-to-back European trips in hopes of reversing his growing
reputation as a weak or indifferent world leader.
</P>
<P>
The events this week revolve around the 50th anniversary of D-Day,
providing Clinton a rare opportunity to speak to the entire world. He
was not yet born when men from the Allied armies waded ashore in
Normandy. Nor did he serve in the armed forces a generation later,
when Americans fought in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
But as the U.S. commander-in-chief and president of the only
remaining superpower, Clinton will occupy a place of honor among the
bands, speechmakers and aged soldiers who will revisit the site of
their sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
White House officials expect the televised ceremonies to bolster
the president's sagging approval ratings. But Clinton has a second
mission on his weeklong European trip: to reassure jittery foreign
leaders that he cares enough about international policy to take the
risks needed to conduct it successfully.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is to meet leaders in France, Italy and Britain.
</P>
<P>
In July, he plans to attend an economic summit in Naples, Italy,
and then travel to Germany and Poland. A topic sure to arise, U.S.
officials say, is one that has probably done the most to undermine
confidence in the Clinton administration's foreign policy: the ethnic
war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
``My government thinks President Clinton is indecisive when it
comes to Bosnia,'' said one Western European diplomat stationed in
Washington who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Personally, I think
it's because he is preoccupied with his domestic policy. That's what
he was elected for and, clearly, he's already thinking about
re-election.''
</P>
<P>
In 1992, running against an incumbent widely respected for his
conduct of foreign policy, particularly of the Persian Gulf war,
Clinton and other Democratic challengers needled George Bush for
focusing too much on problems abroad. Clinton said that he would focus
``like a laser'' on the issues relating to everyday American life,
particularly the economy.
</P>
<P>
Since inauguration, however, two realities have sunk in on the
Clinton team. One is that foreign policy crises cannot be wished away.
The second is that many of the Bush administration positions,
including those singled out by Clinton during the campaign, were
easier to criticize than to correct.
</P>
<P>
Clinton rebuked Bush for returning refugees to Haiti. He spoke
passionately in favor of the United States' being more aggressive in
stopping the Serbs' campaign of ``ethnic cleansing'' in Bosnia. He
criticized Bush for overlooking China's labor camps and other human
rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
Yet as president, Clinton sent his Justice Department into court to
uphold the Bush policy on Haitian refugees. He issued threats against
the Serbs in Bosnia, but little more -- and the ``ethnic cleansing''
continued. On Thursday, he extended the favorable trade status of
China, reciting a litany of reasons identical to Bush's rationale.
</P>
<P>
Those actions have not gone unnoticed in foreign capitals. North
Korean leaders have shown little fear of U.S. retaliation in taking
the United States to the diplomatic brink over their nuclear weapons
development program.
</P>
<P>
In nations friendlier to the United States, such actions further
the perception that the United States isn't up to the task of coping
with Bosnia, the area for which there has perhaps been the widest gap
between U.S. words and U.S. deeds during the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
On May 1, 1993, Secretary of State Warren M. Christopher vowed that
``the clock is ticking'' on Serbian aggression.
</P>
<P>
He then left for Europe, where he failed to rally the United
States' allies. One reason, foreign diplomats say, was that
Christopher signaled that the Clinton administration would not act
unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
``He says he wants to play a role in making peace in Bosnia, but
there are no American ground forces there,'' said a Northern European
diplomat. ``There are Swedish troops in the peacekeeping force. There
are Danish troops, Spanish troops -- French troops, for God's sake! Yet
the only Americans are in Macedonia, where there is no conflict ....''
</P>
<P>
Such diplomats believe the White House is paralyzed by a fear that
an unpopular foreign military adventure could jeopardize Clinton's
chances for re-election.
</P>
<P>
(Optional Add End)
</P>
<P>
Last week, in its annual assessment of global affairs, the
respected International Institute for Strategic Studies termed the
Clinton administration's foreign policy ``a mess'' but noted that
other Western powers have not done much better.
</P>
<P>
``It was a year in which the powers in the West, and indeed a
number of states elsewhere, seemed to be suffering from a serious
attack of strategic arthritis,'' said the independent think tank.
``One major problem is the reluctance of global and regional great
powers to provide the necessary lead. The United States, even more
than usual, does not seem to be following a steady compass.''
</P>
<P>
Similar criticism has been voiced at home, too, by politicians and
foreign policy experts who span the ideological spectrum.
</P>
<P>
``He doesn't have the slightest idea of what this country should be
doing in the post-Cold War era, and neither does his staff,'' said Kim
R. Holmes, vice president of the conservative Heritage Foundation.
``The president wants to avoid any kind of entanglement that can get
him into trouble, but he can't avoid the temptation to speak out. So
he says things on Bosnia, Haiti, Somalia -- things he's not willing to
back up -- and he gets in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
Of course, for every country complaining that Clinton is not
putting the vast military might of the United States to good use,
there are those that would object to his exertion of U.S. influence.
</P>
<P>
When the president so much as protested the brutal caning of an
18-year-old American who had been charged with vandalism in Singapore,
he was widely criticized in Asia for promoting Ugly Americanism.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the Clinton administration's pressure on Japan to open
its markets provoked outrage in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
``You're damned if you do and damned if you don't,'' said David
Wilhelm, the national Democratic chairman.

 Some D-Day Vets Traveling Early to Avoid Crush (Colleville Sur Mer) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
COLLEVILLE SUR MER, France
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Others may not agree, but Raymond
``Buzz'' Davis knows the best place to catch the international
ceremonies in France next Monday marking the 50th anniversary of
D-day.
</P>
<P>
``I'm going to be home in my easy chair watching TV and sipping a
martini when all this is taking place,'' says the 70-year-old
Pasadena, Calif., man as he puffs on his pipe at the Normandy American
cemetery and memorial above Omaha Beach.
</P>
<P>
Around him swirl parades of giggling French schoolchildren, groups
of military support personnel and a stream of foreign and U.S.
visitors to the site that holds the remains of 9,386 Americans.
</P>
<P>
Most gave their lives on D-day, June 6, 1944, when history's
greatest seaborne invasion took place. The 175,000 troops who did make
it to shore that day were the first members of an Allied juggernaut
that rolled into Europe and put an end to Adolf Hitler's plans for a
Thousand-Year Reich.
</P>
<P>
But Davis, a B-26 bomber pilot who flew his first mission that day
over Cherbourg, and other veterans of Normandy battles on the invasion
beaches of Utah, Omaha, Sword, Juno and Gold would rather be out of
the action this time.
</P>
<P>
Frank Reitter of Framingham, Mass., another Normandy vet who
decided to make his pilgrimage now, agrees with Davis.
</P>
<P>
``I figured I better come early because this is going to be a
three-ring circus later,'' he says. ``They told me they could get me
the appropriate badges to get in on the anniversary date, but I said I
don't want them. I won't be here.''
</P>
<P>
Veteran groups, in fact, have been coming and going for
pre-anniversary gatherings over the past few months to avoid the
coming crush, says Millie Waters, a U.S. Army public affairs
specialist at the cemetery.
</P>
<P>
Plenty of other former invasion participants will be battling for
position among the dignitaries slated to show. The lily-pad pond at
the cemetery has been drained and its resident frogs removed to seat
6,100 veterans, Waters says. But 30,000 veterans are expected to
descend upon Europe and no one knows exactly how many will appear in
Normandy.
</P>
<P>
Certainly there is plenty for the early birds to do. Considering
the welcoming festivities being held throughout Europe for the
returning GIs, Brits and Canadians, it is probably safe to say that
never have so few been entertained by so many.
</P>
<P>
Six hundred events are being held in Normandy alone, the rural
region that was the first area to be liberated in France.

Once more fleets of ships are to fill the English Channel and
airplanes dot the sky. Fourteen U.S. Naval vessels will be anchored
off the French beaches on Monday. The day before, an international
flotilla with several of the Navy ships will escort England's royal
yacht with passengers President Clinton and Queen Elizabeth II from
Portsmouth, England, across to the Normandy coast. Flying overhead
will be an international collection of military aircraft.
</P>
<P>
On shore 15 heads of state, including Clinton, the queen, and
French President Francois Mitterrand, will congregate next Monday for
a French-sponsored observance on Utah Beach. Clinton's busy official
schedule also includes sunrise services aboard the aircraft carrier
George Washington; a visit to Pointe du Hoc, the beach cliffs scaled
by the U.S. Rangers, and an afternoon ceremony at the American
cemetery.
</P>
<P>
Two of what promise to be the most popular events involve
re-enactments of a couple of casualty filled D-day actions.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, 600 members of the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions,
along with an Italian combat infantry team, will jump over Amfreville,
simulating the leap by wind-scattered paratroopers during the
invasion. But most eyes will be on a jump earlier that day by a group
of geriatric gladiators. The three dozen Americans range in age from
68 to 84 and are original unit members who leaped into that bottomless
night.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday and Monday, members of the 75th Ranger Regiment will give
a demonstration of the rope climb up Pointe du Hoc, a 100-foot
precipice climbed by the Second Ranger Battalion under German fire in
1944 to destroy artillery trained on the invasion beaches below.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
All of which means major transportation problems for the quiet
Norman countryside. Except for official vehicles all traffic will be
blocked from the beaches on the anniversary day.
</P>
<P>
Even the early visitors are causing problems at places such as the
American cemetery. On one recent weekend, 13,000 cars showed up,
packing the small parking lot and spilling onto the side roads, says
Phil Rivers, cemetery director.
</P>
<P>
``It was the worst traffic jam we ever had.''
</P>
<P>
Veterans groups in the United States warned members via newsletters
of potential problems, adding that even those who made it to some of
the ceremonies could be relegated to back-of-the-crowd status. The
U.S. military, sensitive to this criticism, has said that all veterans
will be designated VIPs and receive preferential seating. Dignitaries
ordinarily given that label are to be called ODVs, or Other
Distinguished Visitors.
</P>
<P>
VIP status or not, Davis is completing his tour and heading home.

 World Cup Sponsors Gamble on Soccer's Questionable U.S. Popularity 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(c) 1994, Newsday 
</P>
<P>
World Cup sponsors are gambling $500 million on advertising rights
despite Americans' past indifference to the world's most popular
sport.
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola, Canon, McDonald's and Snickers candy bars are among the
19 businesses spending as much as $20 million each for sponsorship
rights to the soccer championships, which start next month. This is
the first time the World Cup will be played on American soil.
</P>
<P>
Time Warner, meanwhile, should make at least $35 million, according
to one analyst, from the licensing and merchandising rights to sales
of World Cup apparel and merchandise, which are expected to top $1
billion. More than 100 American companies have agreements with Time
Warner to produce World Cup merchandise.
</P>
<P>
The jury is out over whether all this money is well spent.
</P>
<P>
``These companies are more like pioneers than sponsors,'' said
Brandon Steiner of Steiner Sports Marketing, a Manhattan-based
consulting firm. ``One day soccer will be big in this country, but not
this year. You go out on the street and you stop 25 people, and I
guarantee 20 of them couldn't name a single sponsor. That's where the
World Cup is today.''
</P>
<P>
But do sponsors really have to win the hearts and minds of
Americans to succeed? Probably not. Most have a larger, worldwide
audience in mind.
</P>
<P>
``The attention of the sporting world will be focused on the World
Cup,'' said Robert Baskin, public relations director for Coca-Cola.
``The games are sold out. You can't book flights into the U.S. during
the finals. The World Cup is bigger than the Olympics, especially the
final games. The scale of this is going to be a real eye-opener for
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
In this country, ``it's a niche play,'' said Walter Staab, chairman
of SFM Media Corp., media buyers based in Manhattan. ``There are
certain segments of the population who love soccer and they could be
very much involved in the World Cup if it was marketed correctly.''
</P>
<P>
``There's an immense Hispanic audience that is slowly being tapped
into,'' says Bryan Murphy, publisher of the Westport, Conn.-based
Sports Marketing Newsletter. ``The sponsors will probably be very
happy if they keep in mind who's going to watch. The World Cup is not
going to draw everybody like the Super Bowl, but it'll draw a lot.''
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
The tournament will last from June 17 to July 17, with games played
at nine sites nationwide.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 1 million people nationwide are expected to attend the
games and spend $4 billion on hotels, restaurants, shopping and other
activities.
</P>
<P>
For sponsors, the games pose unusual challenges. Because soccer
doesn't have time-outs and game breaks like football or baseball,
World Cup TV broadcasters ABC and ESPN will show the games without
commercial interruptions. As part of an agreement between the
broadcasters, World Cup '94 and FIFA, the international soccer
federation, commercials will only be shown during the pre- and
post-game shows and at halftime. Names of the major sponsors will be
displayed in 9-minute intervals on top of a game clock in the lower
right hand corner of the screen.
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't mean there's any shortage of soccer-related
commercials and promotional tie-ins:
</P>
<P>
-- Soccer balls are flying in new TV spots by Coke and Adidas
(starring U.S. goalkeeper Tony Meola), among others, and in a contest
by Gillette and a soccer gear giveaway by Energizer batteries.
</P>
<P>
-- McDonald's is hosting a ``McSoccerfest'' tournament in the nine
host cities.
</P>
<P>
-- Wheaties boxes will offer trading cards with Reebok's soccer
endorsers.
</P>
<P>
-- General Motors will be the exclusive advertiser in a special World
Cup edition of Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
-- On July 16, the eve of the final match in Pasadena, Calif.,
Coca-Cola will run two hours of entertainment and commentary from the
World Cup games on TNT. Called ``Big TV,'' the telecast is similar to
one it made in conjunction with the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
The international and U.S. groups organizing the World Cup have
designated levels of sponsorship, including ``official sponsors,'' who
pay $17 million to $20 million for advertising rights, including
billboard space on the playing fields in full view of TV cameras
during the 52 games; ``marketing partners,'' who pay up to $10 million
for ads on one side of the World Cup playing fields, and a variety of
less expensive regional sponsorships. All together, the companies are
spending nearly $500 million.
</P>
<P>
In addition, each TV ``gold'' sponsor is rumored to have paid ABC
nearly $3.5 million for game exposure throughout the 52 matches and
for an undetermined number of 30-second spots during halftime and the
pre- and post-game shows. Lesser ``silver'' sponsors paid an estimated
$2 million to $2.5 million for a similar package that does not include
game exposure.
</P>
<P>
The World Cup's final game is expected to grab as many as 2 billion
viewers worldwide, compared with 750 million for the 1993 Super Bowl.
A ``gold' advertising package costing $3.5 million includes three
30-second TV spots per game over 52 games. That comes out to
approximately $22,000 per spot. By comparison, a 30-second spot during
last year's Super Bowl cost $900,000.

 Part-Time Workers Mushroom in U.S. Labor Force 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
``The husband works two jobs; the wife works two jobs; the kid
works at McDonald's; and the dog stays home and watches TV.''
</P>
<P>
That vision of families surviving on low-paying, part-time jobs was
delivered by Ted Bloom, business agent for New York Teamsters Local
810, during a recent demonstration at the Statue of Liberty. The 250
Teamsters, protesting trucking companies' demands to employ
part-timers at cut-rate wages and benefits, laughed at Bloom's black
humor.
</P>
<P>
But it delivered a chilling point.
</P>
<P>
The number of ``involuntary'' part-time employees -- those who want
full-time jobs but can't get them -- has almost tripled since 1970,
growing to 6.3 million people last year, according to the U.S. Bureau
of Labor Statistics. Almost one out of every five employees -- more
than 21 million -- have part-time jobs, including 2.7 million who work
at two or more part-time jobs. Part-time workers are usually paid
about 60 percent of the hourly scale of full-timers and often don't
get any fringe benefits.
</P>
<P>
As more employers replace full-time workers with part-timers, the
trend is emerging as a hotly contested issue in union negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The recent national trucking strike revealed the deep-seated fear
felt by union members over the threat of employers hiring thousands of
part-timers. The trucking companies wanted the right to hire
part-timers -- who would be paid about half the current union scale -- 
to work in freight terminals.
</P>
<P>
The workers' opposition to part-timers is generally credited with
being the element that kept the Teamsters strike solid in the
24-day-long trucking walkout. Analysts noted that the Teamsters were
the first major union to confront the subject of part-timers on the
picket line. Management negotiators eventually conceded they didn't
realize how sensitive the issue is to workers until they blundered
into it. They withdrew their demand to use part-timers.
</P>
<P>
``We won on the key issue by not letting them change good full-time
jobs to low-wage, part-time jobs,'' said Teamsters president Ronald
Carey. ``We stood up for the American Dream. We drew the line, not
just for Teamsters members, but for all American workers.''
</P>
<P>
Eileen Appelbaum, associate director of research at the
labor-oriented Economic Policy Institute in Washington, said, ``This
is the first recovery where involuntary part-time (jobs) rose through
the recovery, up until July of 1993, and total part-time is still
growing.'' Applebaum asserted that if the Teamsters lost on the
part-time issue, ``it would be a clear signal to employers that they
could even more rapidly substitute part-time for full-time
employment.''
</P>
<P>
Yet Michael Gordon, a Washington-based lawyer who is an authority
on pensions, cautions that society can't mandate full-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
``The business community has made the decision, due to automation,
due to computers, that they can get along without all sorts of
full-time workers, and that is the way to be profitable and
competititive,'' Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the shift to part-time work is a worldwide
phenomenon. The International Labor Organization estimates there are
60 million part-timers -- one out of every seven workers -- in the
industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
Still, the conflict over the use of part-timers is likely to
continue at the bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
Analysts agree that under certain circumstances, part-time jobs can
be attractive, particularly for college students and those
supplementing a pension or a comfortable family income. ``You take one
job at a restaurant offering 20 hours a week. For one person, who has
someone at home (with another salary), filling that job is
voluntary,'' said Tom Nardone, a Bureau of Labor Statistics economist.
``The same job filled by somebody living on their own is
involuntary.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional Add End)
</P>
<P>
The Teamsters' largest employer, United Parcel Service, already
employs one of the largest blocks of part-timers in the nation.
Slightly more than half of UPS' 165,000 Teamsters employees are
part-timers -- who start at $8 an hour -- less than half the scale,
including benefits, of a full-time worker.
</P>
<P>
UPS first negotiated part-timers into the Teamsters contract 32
years ago, but up until 1982 paid them wages comparable to those of
full-timers. In 1982, the starting wage for UPS part-timers was set at
$8 and hasn't been increased since. The company says that 85 to 90
percent of the part-timers are college students, most of whom work
from 10 p.m. until 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
Barry Glassner, author of ``Career Crash: The New Crisis and Who
Survives,'' a book that examines the impact of corporate downsizing,
said that companies enjoy an immediate bottom-line benefit by moving
to part-time workers, but at a serious cost to the long-term health of
the U.S. economy and society.
</P>
<P>
``We want stronger families, but if you have the family members
never together because everybody is holding part-time jobs on
different shifts to make ends meet, you are not going to have a strong
family,'' said Glassner, chairman of the sociology department at the
University of Southern California. ``While the companies are saving
money, in the long run they may not be. They are losing experienced,
trained workers, the most competent work force, and over the long haul
that loss is going to be costly.''

 Education Came Easily to High Court Nominee (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Judge Stephen G. Breyer's steady march toward the
nation's highest court began in San Francisco, where Irving Breyer and
his wife, Anne, raised Stephen and his younger brother, Chuck, who is
also now a lawyer, in a modest, two-story home in an
upper-middle-class neighborhood in the shadow of the University of San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
Their street was bordered on one side by the university and the
other by a private college for women, symbolic, perhaps, of the place
that education took in the family's list of priorities.
</P>
<P>
Education came easily to the young Breyer. In addition to his
classes, he insisted that his parents, who were Jewish but religiously
unobservant, send him to religious school on Sundays, Chuck Breyer
recalled. As a college student, he later taught religious school at a
local synagogue.
</P>
<P>
But Anne Breyer pushed constantly for him to be ``well rounded,''
his brother recalled, chiding that -- if he did not put his books down
and go outside -- he would end up like her brother, Leo, a curmudgeonly
man who taught for a brief time at Radcliffe College and then retired
to a book-lined study for a life of reading and avoiding others.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Breyer insisted that her son take part in sports, although he
was not particularly good at them, and attend camp, although once
there his tender feet quickly won him the nickname Blister King.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, in a pattern that would become typical of his life,
Breyer persevered and excelled, becoming an Eagle Scout at the age of
12. ``He wasn't very popular but he was well known as the troop
brain,'' recalled his Scoutmaster, Bob Anino.
</P>
<P>
The Breyer boys attended the city's prestigious Lowell High School,
the elite academy of the San Francisco public school system. There,
Steve Breyer took an active part in the school debate team, competing
against the likes of future Gov. Edmund G. ``Jerry'' Brown Jr., who
attended rival St. Ignatius Loyola High School. In 1955, Breyer
graduated with only one B marring an otherwise straight-A record. He
was voted ``most likely to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
``He was one of the brightest kids in my 30 years at Lowell,'' said
Paul Lucey, his economics and social science teacher.
</P>
<P>
Breyer wanted to go on to Harvard but bowed to the wishes of his
parents, who feared, again, that he would become too bookish, and
attended Stanford instead. After graduating, he won a Marshall
Scholarship to attend Oxford, where he became fascinated with
economics, then went on to study law at Harvard, where he became an
editor of the law review and quickly developed a reputation as one of
the school's bright lights.
</P>
<P>
In the spring of 1964, Breyer received word that the now late
Justice Arthur M. Goldberg had selected him as a clerk for the high
court term beginning in October.
</P>
<P>
Historians recall the 1964-'65 term primarily because of one
decision, Griswold vs. Connecticut, in which the court for the first
time recognized a constitutional right to privacy in sexual matters.
The court held that states could not forbid married couples from
buying or using contraceptives, a ruling that laid the grounds for the
Roe v. Wade decision a decade later that guaranteed women the right to
abortions.
</P>
<P>
Breyer, according to fellow clerks, helped Goldberg draft his
opinion. But the opinion's central idea that a right to privacy could
be grounded in the Ninth Amendment, which reserves to the people
rights not ``enumerated'' elsewhere in the Bill of Rights, was one
that Goldberg had toyed with earlier and, therefore, provides little
evidence of Breyer's own views.
</P>
<P>
Over the next several years, Breyer worked in the Justice
Department's antitrust division. He also met the woman who in 1967
became his wife. She is the former Joanna Hare, an Englishwoman who
then was working as an assistant in the Washington office of London's
Sunday Times.
</P>
<P>
Joanna Breyer, a psychologist at Boston's Dana Farber Clinic, was
the daughter of Lord John Blakenham, a prominent British political
figure who was a leader of Britain's Conservative Party. The marriage
contributed heavily to Breyer's current wealth. According to his
financial disclosure forms, which report assets in broad categories,
the couple has at least $3.2 million and perhaps as much as $6.7
million.
</P>
<P>
From Washington, Breyer returned to Harvard to teach regulatory law
but he continued to visit the capital, working for several months in
1973 on the Watergate prosecutions, joining two other Harvard
colleagues as aides to Archibald Cox. In 1974, he accepted Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy's offer to head the staff of the Judiciary Committee's
subcommittee on administrative law. In 1979, he returned to Washington
again, this time as the Judiciary Committee's chief counsel.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
That background, plus his years on the bench, made Breyer an
immediate candidate for the ``short list'' of high court nominees when
Clinton returned the White House to Democratic hands.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, when he arrived in Washington last year for a luncheon
interview with Clinton, in pain from a bicycle accident in which he
had broken a rib, White House officials and Breyer's friends believed
that the Supreme Court job that was then open would be his. That
afternoon, as he stretched out on the floor of White House counsel
Bernard Nussbaum's office to rest, officials told him to delay his
return to Cambridge, Mass., and begin preparing an acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
But, as Clinton pondered his choice, Breyer's lack of an engaging
life story -- a factor that has always had strong appeal to the
president -- did him in. Clinton opted instead for Ruth Bader Ginsburg,
a pioneer in women's rights whose biography offered more excitement.
</P>
<P>
Breyer, disappointed, returned to Cambridge but characteristically
avoided any negative comment about Clinton's selection and
conspicuously attended Ginsburg's swearing-in ceremony.
</P>
<P>
One year later, with the White House already finding that it had
more excitement than it can handle, a nominee with a conventional
background and broad support in the Senate seems newly appealing.
Breyer's time had come.

 Breyer's Pragmatism, Talents Make Him Shoo-In for Court Job (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When friends and colleagues of Judge Stephen G. Breyer
search for anecdotes about him, what they recall is his career advice.
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Sullivan, now a law professor at Stanford University, was
starting as a member of the Harvard Law School faculty when she met
Breyer. At a faculty reception, Breyer urged her to get involved in
``something like the federal sentencing commission -- something
practical.''
</P>
<P>
``We need intellectuals to get involved in projects that have an
impact on people's lives,'' Sullivan recalls Breyer telling her.
</P>
<P>
To Akhil Amar, who worked as a law clerk in Breyer's judicial
chambers and now teaches at Yale Law School, the judge offered a more
direct suggestion: After listening to his young clerk's plans for a
series of law review articles, Breyer counseled him that to really
have an impact, he should write a book. And he should not wait too
long, Breyer added. ``I really wanted to have a book before I was
40,'' Amar recalls him saying.
</P>
<P>
The advice, as Breyer told those he counseled, was autobiographical
 -- reflecting twin elements of his life that explain why Breyer now
stands on the edge of an all-but-certain confirmation to the nation's
highest court: a strong desire to use his formidable legal talents to
make a practical impact beyond Ivory Tower theorizing, coupled with a
keen appreciation of the quickest, surest routes toward his own
advancement.
</P>
<P>
``Every move he has made has paid off,'' said his friend Alan
Dershowitz, a Harvard Law School professor and noted criminal defense
lawyer. ``Steve just never makes a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
But while Breyer's path has been so smooth and steady as to appear
almost effortless, it has provided few clues to answer the ultimate
question: if he is to become a leader of the Supreme Court, as
President Clinton hopes, where would Breyer take it?
</P>
<P>
Breyer has become well-regarded as an expert on federal regulatory
law, about which he has written influential articles and books. But by
contrast with several past Republican nominees, who had staked out
clear ideological positions before being chosen, Breyer has made
almost no public comment on constitutional law or on such
controversial topics as abortion or privacy rights or affirmative
action.
</P>
<P>
``Steve is a lot like President Clinton in many ways. He's a
pragmatist, a centrist with an enormous array of friends,'' said
Dershowitz.
</P>
<P>
In pursuit of his goals, Breyer has traveled a route from Stanford
to Oxford to Harvard to a Supreme Court clerkship, back to Harvard, to
the staff of the Senate Judiciary Committee and then to the federal
appeals court bench -- mixing academic work with immersion in practical
politics.
</P>
<P>
``Steve has the same philosophy his father had,'' said his aunt,
Shirley Black, whose brother, Irving Breyer, was a prominent attorney
and public servant in San Francisco, counsel for nearly 40 years to
the city school board. ``It's doing the most good for people. If you
want to help people, you should try to gain power.''
</P>
<P>
Along the way, he has impressed and charmed scores of people
scattered through the upper reaches of American law and politics, from
the late Justice Arthur M. Goldberg, who used to tell friends he hoped
to see his former clerk one day don a justice's robes; to Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy, for whom he worked in 1974-'75 and again in 1979-'80 as a
top Judiciary Committee aide and who then secured an appeals court
judgeship for him in the Carter administration's closing days; to such
conservatives as Sens. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, and Strom Thurmond,
R-S.C., whose support for him has virtually guaranteed a smooth
confirmation.
</P>
<P>
What he has not done, conceded another longtime friend, Peter
Edelman, is live a life that makes ``good copy.''
</P>
<P>
Breyer's biography includes no epic struggle, none of the
up-from-obscurity morality tale that so delights (and sometimes
deludes) American audiences. At home in Cambridge, Mass., in a
comfortable house not far from the Harvard campus, Breyer lives the
life of a conventional and successful member of the American
intellectual and policy elite -- enjoying fine food, wine and
conversation, rooting for his hometown baseball and basketball teams,
running and riding a beat up, one-speed bicycle to stay fit, driving a
dark blue Volvo station wagon, sending his three children to Harvard,
Stanford and Yale.
</P>
<P>
Despite the lack of drama in his life, Breyer could become one of
the most influential public figures of his generation. Many lawyers
who study the court believe that Breyer has a strong chance of being
far more than merely one vote among nine.
</P>
<P>
The current court, in the opinion of most lawyers and academics who
study it, notably lacks a leader. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist
and Justice Antonin Scalia, who could exercise leadership by virtue,
respectively, of position and intellectual prowess, stand too far
toward the judicial right to do so effectively. The justices in the
court's conservative center -- David H. Souter, Sandra Day O'Connor,
Anthony M. Kennedy -- have shown little ability to lead.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, of the nine men and two women placed on the court in
the last generation, only Scalia and, perhaps, Clinton's other
nominee, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, come close to matching Breyer's record
of legal scholarship, intelligence and achievement.
</P>
<P>
At a time when many federal judges complain frequently about the
crushing burden of their workloads, Breyer was able to handle the work
of an appeals court judge while still teaching at Harvard, playing a
central role on the Federal Sentencing Commission and educating
himself about architecture to guide the construction of a new federal
courthouse in Boston.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, unlike Ginsburg, who often has appeared to associates as
distant, shy or aloof, Breyer is gregarious and charming. His
experiences heading a Senate staff, on the court of appeals and on the
sentencing commission demonstrate that he is a highly effective
small-group politician who inspires genuine affection on the part of
those who have worked under him and loyal friendship from those he has
served.
</P>
<P>
About the only open opponent to his nomination so far has been
consumer advocate Ralph Nader, who objected that Breyer has sided with
big business too often in antitrust cases and has been too skeptical
of federal regulatory efforts. But in a telling example of the network
of Breyer's friendships, Nader's top lawyer, Alan Morrison, is a close
friend of the nominee's who has defended Breyer's views.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Breyer's judicial opinions on antitrust prove little. He is clearly
no economic populist, but the Supreme Court's conservative rulings on
antitrust cases over the last two decades give lower court judges
relatively little leeway.
</P>
<P>
But his views on regulation reveal more about him. Breyer's
writings show a desire to bring order to messy legal problems and an
underlying belief, reflective of the California progressive tradition
in which he grew up, that government programs are subject to
improvement by careful, expert thought.
</P>
<P>
But there is nothing to indicate much about Breyer's views on the
great constitutional issues that attract attention to the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
That absence of comment has made some liberals uneasy about
Breyer's imminent ascension to the Supreme Court, particularly given
his endorsements from such prominent conservative voices as Hatch and
the Wall Street Journal editorial page.
</P>
<P>
Breyer's friends say that as a justice he will emerge as a newly
liberated champion of an updated form of judicial liberalism -- one who
will uphold strong protections of civil rights and civil liberties but
be more skeptical about the ability of federal judges to improve
society than was the case during the court's liberal era under former
chief justice Earl Warren.
</P>
<P>
Now that Breyer has achieved his ultimate goal, argued Dershowitz,
``all the constraints are off. There's nothing else he wants in
life.''

<TEXT>
<P>
Here's the recipe for the baked Vidalia appetizer as served at
Vidalia, Jeff and Sallie Buben's aptly named downtown Washington
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
VIDALIA'S BAKED ONION 
</P>
<P>
(4 servings) 
</P>
<P>
4 jumbo Vidalia onions, whole with skins left on
</P>
<P>
8 tablespoons (1 stick) butter, softened
</P>
<P>
4 tablespoons brown sugar
</P>
<P>
8 tablespoons sherry vinegar
</P>
<P>
4 tablespoons beef glaze or bouillon
</P>
<P>
4 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary
</P>
<P>
4 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme 4 large shiitake mushroom
 caps, finely diced
</P>
<P>
4 ounces country ham, finely diced
</P>
<P>
4 tablespoons chopped chives
</P>
<P>
1 ripe tomato, finely diced
</P>
<P>
Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
Cut ¼ inch from the bottom (rounded root end) of each onion. Score
the skin of each onion at 1-inch intervals, starting from the cut
bottom end upward to within ½ inch of the top. Pull the sections of
onion skin back and up over the top of each onion, like a tassel.
</P>
<P>
On a work surface, place four 12-inch-square pieces of aluminum
foil. Place ¼ of the butter, sugar, vinegar, beef glaze (or bouillon),
rosemary, thyme and diced mushroom in the center of each piece. Top
each with an onion and draw the foil from 4 corners to the top center,
like a pyramid. Crimp the foil around the ``neck'' of the onion,
leaving the ``tassel'' of onion skin exposed. There should be a hole
in the center.
</P>
<P>
Bake in a pre-heated 375-degree oven about 1 hour and 10 minutes,
or until soft. Transfer onions and mushrooms to serving plates,
reserving the juices.
</P>
<P>
Combine the cooking juices from all the onions in a saucepan and
gently heat with the ham, chives and tomato. Season to taste with salt
and pepper. Pour ¼ of the sauce over each onion and serve.

 Espresso Book Not for the Coffee Table 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you decide after visiting a coffee bar that hanging out in a
cafe drinking latte is the only way to spend the afternoon, then you
may want to pick up ``Espresso: Culture Cuisine,'' by Karl Petzke
and Sara Slavin (Chronicle Books, $14.95), two people who must feel
the way you do.
</P>
<P>
More a private treat than a coffee-table tome (it's a smallish
paperback), this exquisitely designed collaboration is closer to a CD
Rom experience (or a guide to typography in the late 20th century)
than to a real book.
</P>
<P>
In bits and beautiful pieces, it offers coffee history, a little
Neruda, a bit of Yeats, cafe culture in soft focus and some very
tempting coffee-based recipes.

 Cultivating Friends: Plant Buddies That Look Out For Each Other
(Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Companion planting allows the gardener to become a
matchmaker with plants, turning strangers into fast friends. The
practice of companion planting goes back centuries, driven by the
abiding belief that some plants do better when grown near other
species, either for protection from pests or as a result of a chemical
interaction beneficial to at least one of the partners.
</P>
<P>
Today, the technique is unproven scientifically, although in its
quaintness it may have merit, especially since each gardener's own
preferences give us gardens of diversity and character.
</P>
<P>
In one plot, the aim might be to attract birds, in another, to
repel raccoons. Companion planting in the modern garden is generally a
casual undertaking, with few rules and an openness to new ideas and
combinations. In fact, one of its basic truths is that where one
combination might fail in one garden, it could prove indispensable in
another.
</P>
<P>
Most people, whether they are new to gardening or have many seasons
behind them, are familiar with the marigold's reputation for warding
off all manner of insect pests above and below the ground. Although
this reputation may be rather overblown, it goes to the basic concept
of companion planting: Plant marigolds among your vegetables, and
you'll have fewer bugs.
</P>
<P>
Marigolds, in field tests and in lab trials, seem to have a pretty
good record in controlling damaging subterranean nematodes that invade
plant roots.
</P>
<P>
But in most cases, no one knows why something does better when
planted near something else. One gardener swears that planting
radishes around her beans controls Mexican bean beetles. I have tried
this in my own garden and have seen little effect on the voracious
bean pests.
</P>
<P>
While the variables from one garden to the next will dictate much
of how successfully companion planting works, there are some
fundamental principles that are universal and have been proven:
</P>
<P>
-- DON'T plant tomatoes, eggplant and potatoes close together. All
members of the nightshade family, they tend to share pests. Thus, if
the Colorado potato beetle finds your eggplant near the potatoes, the
pest, probably will afflict the eggplant. Some gardeners find that
eggplant is more vulnerable to the beetles than potatoes.
</P>
<P>
-- DON'T plant parsley, carrot and cilantro near each other. These
also share a family tree and the pesky carrot fly. Its grub prefers to
tunnel into the carrot but will go to parsley and even cilantro if
they are close at hand.
</P>
<P>
-- DO interplant onions, radishes and even -- yes -- marigolds with
other garden varieties. Apart from the practical aspect of sneaking
space-saving onions and radishes among larger plants -- they rarely
compete with companion plants and they do very well in the smallest of
spots -- they emit an odor that is repugnant to a wide range of insect
pests. Ordinarily, radishes and onions are pulled before they bloom.
However, if they are left to mature, their flowers are most attractive
to predatory insects that prey on pests.
</P>
<P>
-- DO combine dissimilar species -- eggplant with beans; corn with
potatoes; lettuce and basil with tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
-- DO intermingle herbs with vegetables. With the exception of
fennel, nearly all herbs offer aid to garden plants by attracting
predatory insects, repelling pests or, simply, providing a compatible
growth habit.
</P>
<P>
-- DO interplant flowers with vegetables. These will attract birds
and insects that prey on many pests. The classic example of this is
nasturtium, with its peppery, edible foliage and its aromatic, edible
flowers, themselves a magnet for hummingbirds.
</P>
<P>
-- WORTH A TRY: Plant bush beans among tomatoes. I did this a couple
of years ago and was delighted with the beans' ability to keep down
weeds. In addition, they will fix nitrogen in the soil, providing an
important nutrient to tomatoes. As a living mulch, low-growing bush
beans ensure an even moisture content in the soil, important in the
prevention of blossom-end rot in tomatoes. One caveat on this
companionship, however: My bean crop was poor, I think because the
tomato vines robbed the beans of their full measure of sunlight.
</P>
<P>
-- WORTH A TRY: Combine corn with pumpkins, melons or other climbing
squashes, although I have never tried cucumbers. The rough foliage of
the squashes is reputed to dissuade raccoons from invading the corn at
the time ears are ripening. The corn is thought to deter the squash
vine borer moth from laying its eggs on pumpkin vines. The squash
shades the ground around the corn and even climbs up stalks but does
not hinder the corn's growth and development.

 Hard Questions on Welfare 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The following editorial appeared in Tuesday's Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
Even the most draconian welfare rules are said to be aimed at
giving welfare recipients ``better incentives'' or ``the right
messages.''
</P>
<P>
It isn't only a view expressed by right-wing Republicans eager to
cut programs. It has also been offered by President Clinton in
defending his proposal to require welfare recipients to accept jobs
after two years or be tossed off the rolls.
</P>
<P>
His point is that if the cycle of dependency is not broken at some
point, it can go on forever, sometimes across generations.
</P>
<P>
But there are more and less intrusive requirements that can be
placed on the recipients of government assistance. It is one thing to
say that if someone gets a government check, the taxpayers have a
right at some point to demand some work. It is another to use the
welfare rules to affect other, more personal aspects of individual
behavior -- for example, whether someone should have an additional
child.
</P>
<P>
New Jersey and a growing number of other jurisdictions have decided
that this, too, should come under the welfare rules. They have denied
additional benefits to women who have children while they are on
welfare. These recipients continue to collect what they were receiving
before, but no more. Clinton has decided to include in his reform plan
a provision allowing -- but not compelling -- states to follow New
Jersey's lead.
</P>
<P>
In one sense, Clinton's proposal simply marks an extension of
current practice. The federal government has already given New Jersey
a waiver to pursue its experiment. Clinton is on record as supporting
this and similar waivers to other states.
</P>
<P>
Some civil-liberties advocates have argued that because the New
Jersey rule affects one of the most personal decisions a person can
make, it is unconstitutional. A case on the matter is now in court,
but the civil-liberties argument is not entirely convincing. New
Jersey is not telling anyone that she cannot have a child, simply that
the state will not support an additional newborn.
</P>
<P>
Is the New Jersey rule actually reducing the number of children
born to the welfare rolls? An early study showed a 16 percent
reduction in the number of children born to mothers on welfare in New
Jersey, but a subsequent analysis found that the number of births had
been underreported, and that the real reduction was about 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
``I never pretended or intended to have the law bring about a
dramatic decrease in births,'' said State Assemblyman Wayne R. Bryant,
leading supporter of the new rules. ``It was a responsibility issue.''
</P>
<P>
The truth is that welfare reform is very much about influencing
behavior -- or, at the very least, about keeping government rules from
offering the wrong incentives.
</P>
<P>
The New Jersey approach strikes us as being within the range of
state experiments the federal government could permit. But as Bryant
suggests, no one should pretend it will produce miracles.

transmit but difficult to treat; a look at one of the few treatment
centers in the United States. 700 words, by Glen Justice (Times) (l).

genetically healthier offspring by not mixing her genes with those of
a male. 810 words, by Michael Quintanilla (Times) (l).

   TEXAS-ALAMO -- SAN ANTONIO -- For nearly 90 years, the Daughters of

CyberSurfing: Potholes, perturbations and predicaments observed on
the information superhighway:
</P>
<P>
Most visitors to Paris are satisfied with their little Eiffel Tower
souvenirs, but that's obviously not enough for Michael Hayward, who
seems to be an unusually sentimental sort.
</P>
<P>
``I'd like to locate a source for the benches which are found
everywhere in Paris city parks,'' he wrote in a recent posting on the
Internet newsgroup soc.culture.french. ``The older design ... (is)
shaped like an elongated `S' with narrow `slats' (roughly square in
cross section) running lengthwise. The supports (legs/backs) are a
somewhat ornately designed cast iron. As I recall, these benches are
(always?) painted a distinctive shade of high gloss deep green. ...
Has anyone else got fond memories of these benches? Has anyone else
made an attempt to track down a source?''
</P>
<P>
From France Olivier Clary responded with the lyrics of a popular
song:
</P>
<P>
Les amoureux qui s'becotent sur les bancs publics/
</P>
<P>
bancs publics/
</P>
<P>
bancs publics/
</P>
<P>
en s'foutant pas mal du r'gard oblique/
</P>
<P>
des passants honteux.
</P>
<P>
(``The lovers kissing on the public benches/ the public benches/
the public benches/ don't give a damn about the nasty glances/ of the
shameful passersby.'')
</P>
<P>
Parisian Gregory Miezelis, however, actually had an answer: The
first place to look, said Miezelis, is Les Domaines, a French
government agency that auctions off surplus equipment. He also
suggested checking the Paris flea market's many antique dealers.
Selling price? About 950 francs plus 10 percent tax, or roughly $200,
although cybernaut Miezelis said he saw one sold at auction for only
350 francs.

They Want His mtv.com
</P>
<P>
Adam Curry wants his mtv.com.
</P>
<P>
Curry, a longtime video jock for MTV, set up a music-news bulletin
board on the Internet a year ago, using his home computer and the
address mtv.com. Now he's being being sued by his ex-employer for
copyright infringement.
</P>
<P>
Curry uses mtv.com to dish industry gossip (``cybersleaze,'' he
calls it), and offers concert schedules, band interviews and
commentary. He estimates 35,000 log-ins daily. Many of those users are
now following the saga of Curry vs. MTV-from Curry's viewpoint only.
The cable music network, which prides itself on up-to-the-minute
hipness, isn't ``jacked into the net,'' as Curry put it in a recent
missive to his supporters.
</P>
<P>
The on-line faithful have been flaming MTV as ``totally lame'' and
``a pitiful network of corporate pigs.'' Wrote a user named Daredevil:
``DON'T LET THE LAMERS GET YOU DOWN!''
</P>
<P>
Curry claims mtv.com began with the ``blessing and support'' of MTV
execs, but after he resigned April 25, ``things got ugly.'' (It
probably didn't help that Curry posted a resignation letter on the
Internet accusing MTV of selling out the ``M'' in its name.) In
federal court in Manhattan in May, MTV's lawyers argued for an
injunction against Curry's use of mtv.com. Further hearings are
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
``This has nothing to do with Adam's departure,'' says an MTV
spokeswoman. ``We've tried unsuccessfully for a year to get Adam to
stop using the MTV trademark to market his services.'' Said the
defiant Curry in e-mail: ``mtv.com will always exist on the net.''

 ON WINE: The Wines of Summer 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As cool weather gives way to warm, and hot not far off, many people
feel the need to switch gears in their wine-drinking. Room-temp red
becomes less interesting than chilled, crisp white, and picnics
conjure up stuff that's soft, slightly sweet and quaffable.
</P>
<P>
Stocking up wine for summer takes just as much thought as buying
wine for those dinners by the fireplace, yet few wine shops are savvy
enough to suggest the right warm-afternoon wines. There is these days
a mania in America for Chardonnay, and since so much of this wine is
white (thus chillable) and soft and slightly sweet, one might assume
Chardonnay would be a great picnic quaff. Many wine shop owners still
recommend it.
</P>
<P>
Bad thinking. After Petite Sirah, Chardonnay is my least-favorite
picnic wine because of the high alcohol (above 13 percent in most
cases) and the heavy oak flavor the wines often have. And in cheaper
wines, that oak flavoring is not derived from aging in a barrel, but
from the winemaker's latest trick: dipping in a huge teabag filled
with oak chips.
</P>
<P>
What I look for in picnic and patio wine is good, strong, fruity
flavor -- something to compete with the charcoal briquettes burning in
the firepit -- and alcohol low enough not to intrude on the taste of
the fruit.
</P>
<P>
Stocking up doesn't require a cellar. In the few months you will
have the wine before it's consumed, nothing will happen to it if it's
kept relatively cool (70 degrees is fine) and out of direct light. And
I do suggest buying at least a case of wine to be sure you'll get good
wine before it all sells out, and to have a few extra bottles around
in case of emergencies, such as friends popping by unexpectedly, which
always seems to happen.
</P>
<P>
If you look at the summer as comprising 12 weekends during which
you and your friends will consume a bottle per weekend day, you'll
need two cases of wine at minimum. So with that in mind, here are my
suggestions for what to buy. Note that you may have to replenish the
supply faster than you might think, especially if the wine is so good
people drink it faster than you expect.
</P>
<P>
Chenin Blanc: This grape makes the great wines of Vouvray in
France and, in California, a wine with a softer, more melony aroma and
taste, perfect for picnics. Four bottles.
</P>
<P>
German Riesling: A must for the summer. Try various producers of
Kabinett or Spatlese wines, which are not totally dry but offer
marvelous acidity and balance with less alcohol than most wines -- 
about 10 percent. Four bottles.
</P>
<P>
Gewurztraminer: I am smitten with this usually off-dry white
wine. I prefer it drier so it matches with canapes and sandwiches. My
summer buying pattern calls for a whole case of various producers'
Gewurztraminers, but unless you have the same sort of fetish for it
that I do, I'd recommend three bottles.
</P>
<P>
Sparkling wine: Light, crisp and a perfect summer beverage.
Bubbly is always in fashion, and it is a great substitute for heavier
white wines. Three bottles.
</P>
<P>
Sauvignon Blanc: You need not pay much more than $7 for some of
the best of these wines, and usually you can find excellent wines in
the $5 to $6 range. A great all-purpose wine, excellent with food.
Three bottles.
</P>
<P>
Rose: Here we have the true all-purpose wine, usually made with
enough flavor but still dry enough to match with food. Chilled, it is
appealing to cool off with all by itself at poolside. Buy only the
best ($9 a bottle or so) to make sure you're getting a high-quality
rose, though Grenache Rose is being made better these days and may be
found at $7 to $8. Three bottles.
</P>
<P>
Beaujolais: Great light red wine such as this is a real treat,
especially when chilled and served with hearty foods. Three bottles.
</P>
<P>
Lighter-styled Zinfandel: Buy one bottle of a good Zinfandel for
those moments when the evening air suddenly chills and demands a
better, richer, heartier wine.
</P>
<P>
One final tip: Buy only the youngest vintages of any of these
wines, and from producers whose names you know.

 WHAT'S COOKING: Oil as Fat May Be Too Thin for Baking 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q: When I'm baking, there are so many choices to be had in the fat
category, even in the wrapped sticks of butter or margarine alone.
What's the difference? Can I use a vegetable oil spread instead of
butter in my baking?
</P>
<P>
A: There are many variables -- the quantity of cream used, the
quality of that cream, how much filler has been added and how much
salt is used for preservative.
</P>
<P>
Generally, the most reliable baking product is either unsalted
butter or basic margarine. These two products have the highest content
of fat and are not filled with gums or fillers that might affect the
baking result in some way. While there are many reduced-fat options on
the market now, because of added liquid, they won't produce
satisfactory baking results as easily.
</P>
<P>
If you replace butter in a recipe with a vegetable oil spread, you
will not get the same result, because the basic fat component will be
oil and not cream.

A: The following recipe offers some alternatives for sugar-free
cookies.
</P>
<P>
ALMOND SUGAR COOKIES

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a medium-size bowl, combine
margarine and sweetener, beating until light and fluffy. Mix in egg
white and almond extract. Gradually stir in flour, baking soda, and
cream of tartar; mix well. Form into ½-inch balls. Place on a
non-stick cookie sheet. Dip a flat-bottomed glass into flour and press
down on each ball to flatten cookie. Top each cookie with an almond
slice.

 How to Grill Meat 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here are some tips on grilling from the National Live Stock Meat
Board, an industry group in Chicago, Ill.
</P>
<P>
-- Prepare coals well in advance so they have time to reach the
correct temperature before the food is cooked.
</P>
<P>
-- To check the temperature of coals, place the palm of your hand at
cooking height, just above the grid. Count the number of seconds you
can hold your hand there before the heat is so uncomfortable you have
to pull it away (to count seconds, count one-one thousand; two-one
thousand, etc.). Approximate times-temperatures are: low, 5 seconds;
medium, 4 seconds; medium-hot, 3 seconds; hot, 2 seconds.
</P>
<P>
-- In appearance, low coals are covered with a thick layer of gray
ash; medium coals glow through a layer of gray ash; and hot coals are
barely covered with gray ash.
</P>
<P>
-- Avoid cooking over direct flame so the outside of food is not
charred.
</P>
<P>
-- When cooking meats, trim them well of fat to avoid flare-ups.
</P>
<P>
-- Use spatula or tongs to turn foods; don't pierce with fork or
flavorful juices will be lost.
</P>
<P>
-- In warm weather, it is important to keep cold foods cold (below 40
degrees) until you are ready to cook or serve them.
</P>
<P>
-- Food should not be left out at room temperature for long periods.
Two hours is the maximum for most foods; extremely perishable items
should not sit out more than 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
-- Leftovers should be packed quickly in small, covered containers,
and returned to the cooler, refrigerator or freezer as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
-- Keep raw and cooked foods separate. Wash utensils and surfaces
that touch raw food with hot soapy water before using them for
anything else.

 Think Big When You Fire Up the Grill 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thinking about cooking out tonight? Why not think big?
</P>
<P>
That's BIG, as in barbecued beef tenderloin, stuffed turkey breast,
marinated leg of lamb, grilled salmon roast, or grilled-smoked ham.
</P>
<P>
All these things are perfect on the grill, and can make a mighty
nice change from the ``small stuff'' like burgers and dogs. They can
turn a family meal into an occasion, or make a memorable feast for
guests. And they're really no more trouble than preparing and watching
over a lot of little things on the grill.
</P>
<P>
``You can do anything on a grill,'' says Francie George, corporate
vice president of Baltimore's Haussner's restaurant and an
enthusiastic outdoor griller at home. ``I do Christmas dinner on the
grill,'' she says. Other favorite items to grill are whole fish, fresh
ham, turkey, prime rib and spare ribs. Everything is cooked on ``an
old, beat-up'' kettle-type grill she's had for nearly 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show she's not alone in her enthusiasm. Americans
celebrated 2.6 billion ``barbecue events'' last year, up from 2.3
billion in 1991, according to the Barbecue Industry Association, a
trade group based in Naperville, Ill.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-three percent of all families in the United States own a
barbecue grill of some type, the association says. Gas types have a
slight edge over charcoal.
</P>
<P>
And whatever the type, 52 percent use their grills year-round.
</P>
<P>
The trend toward more meal preparation over coals or flame outdoors
doesn't surprise Melanie Barnard, author of ``The Best Covered and
Kettle Grills Cookbook Ever'' (HarperCollins, $16.95).
</P>
<P>
Grilling appeals because it's so easy -- it's less formal, and
there's less cleanup afterward -- a factor that appeals in family
dining and in today's entertaining.
</P>
<P>
``Casual entertaining is where it's at,'' Barnard says.
</P>
<P>
``Grilling speaks casual entertaining,'' she says. ``You don't do
formal things on a grill -- because it's a participatory experience.
And that's what I think is fun about it. You get people together and
they get their hands in. ... Maybe it's prehistoric, maybe it's part
of our genetic makeup. Anything you make on a grill tastes better.''
</P>
<P>
While her book offers recipes for such things as Cajun burgers and
``the ultimate hot dog,'' there are also recipes for whole chicken
stuffed with lemons and sage, summer herb stuffed turkey breast,
grill-smoked brisket, ham, and country pot roast, apple and
sage-stuffed pork roast and spiced rack of lamb.
</P>
<P>
``You can do chickens and ducks, whole turkeys, big pieces of
fish'' quite easily on the grill, Barnard says.
</P>
<P>
It takes just a little planning to make a memorable meal around a
grilled specialty, she says. Simple dishes are the best accompaniment:
She suggests starting with such snacks as cheese and crackers, or
grilled toast with salsa, side dishes such as coleslaw, potato salad,
or old-fashioned macaroni salad, some fresh vegetables from the
farmer's market, all topped off with ice cream or frozen yogurt and
sliced fresh fruit.
</P>
<P>
``The biggest mistake people make,'' she says, is planning a menu
that requires them to be in the kitchen finishing side dishes at the
same time they're outside watching the grill. That's why easy things
that can be made ahead, or require only the tiniest bit of last-minute
preparation, are the most practical choices.
</P>
<P>
And then the centerpiece can really stand out.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
``The key to doing larger pieces is to roast them slowly at lower
temperature,'' George says. She cooks everything with indirect heat,
moving the coals aside after they're hot to encircle the grill, or
placing them in semicircular piles on each side of the grate.
</P>
<P>
The vents in the grill also help control the temperature, she says.
``When I do something large, I close the bottom vents and open the top
ones, to let in a little more oxygen.'' She tries to keep the
temperature between 275 and 300 degrees. (She recommends buying a good
meat thermometer, commercial-style if you can find one at a kitchen
specialty store or restaurant supply outlet.)
</P>
<P>
``Doing a whole turkey is wonderful,'' she says. ``I do nothing to
it. I just let it cook.'' She props up less dense areas of the bird by
placing an old half-cup measuring cup under the tail, and allows half
an hour per pound to cook the bird. The skin gets brown and crispy and
the flesh is firm and juicy, she says.
</P>
<P>
``Another thing that's spectacular on the grill is a whole
salmon,'' George says. She divides the coals into two semi-circles on
opposite sides of the grill, so no part of the fish will be directly
over the coals. ``The night before I wash it and dry it and make sure
there are no scales left on it, then I open it up and fill the
interior with a paste made of honey and brown sugar.'' You can also
put in sprigs of fresh herbs -- dill, tarragon or thyme all work well,
she says. The honey-sugar mixture should be the consistency of thick
paste. She stores the fish in a plastic bag on a baking sheet in the
refrigerator until she's ready to cook it.
</P>
<P>
She puts the fish in a two-sided rack, so it can be turned over
halfway through the cooking process. For perfectly cooked fish, she
says, allow 10 minutes per inch of thickness at 400 degrees. To make
sure the fire stays hot enough when she divides the hot coals into two
piles, she adds an extra eight to 10 coals per side. Then she throws
on a handful of wood chips that have been soaked in water for a couple
of hours. ``I predominantly use hickory,'' she says. ``I think
mesquite is too strong. Cherry is also nice.''
</P>
<P>
With fresh ham, she says, ``before I cook it, I rub it with a
combination of freshly grated horseradish and honey.'' The heat from
the coals dries out the glaze, and when the ham is sliced, ``you get
little tastes of it'' with each slice, she says.
</P>
<P>
For a truly special occasion, she says, she will do a New
England-style clam bake. She uses a two-part steamer, putting corn in
the husk and potatoes in the water in the bottom section, then
layering lobster, clams, monkfish, shrimp, mussels and perhaps scrod
in the top section. She sprinkles each layer with Old Bay; the steam
picks up the spice and takes it back to the water, so that everything
is just suffused with the flavor.
</P>
<P>
Delightful as it is, grilling needn't always be a big deal. ``If
I'm cooking for myself, which I do quite a lot these days because my
kids are all grown and my husband travels a lot,'' Ms. Barnard says,
``I would rather go turn the grill on and cook myself up a piece of
chicken, than to cook it in the house where I'd have to dirty a frying
pan and it's no more time and no more effort and it tastes a whole lot
better.
</P>
<P>
``We have good seafood,'' in Connecticut, where she lives, Barnard
says. ``Pretty soon we'll get soft shells. I love to grill those. I do
that for myself. That's a real treat.''

just that you be home three or four hours ahead to get it started. If
you don't have that luxury, you can add club soda or beer to a package
of Quick Loaf mix, stir it up, let it sit 10 minutes in a loaf pan and
bake. The resulting loaf doesn't have the chewy, elastic texture of
kneaded bread, but it has a good fresh-baked aroma, and for home-made
bread that's ready one hour after you open the package, with
essentially no work, that's not bad. The cracked wheat and nine-grain
flavors are particularly good, and there are also garlic, onion,
oatmeal and cinnamon-raisin mixes. In supermarkets.

I'LL HAVE A RIK ... A RKATS ... OH, MAKE IT A CHARDONNAY: Wente
Bros. Winery of Livermore, Calif., has agreed to invest in Sameba Co.,
a winery in the Republic of Georgia -- where some scholars believe wine
was invented thousands of years ago. Distribution is expected to be in
the four Commonwealth of Independent States countries where Wente now
distributes its own California wines: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and
Lithuania. University of California, Davis-trained winemaker Hughes
Ryan has already moved to Georgia to supervise the fall's crush. The
wines will be made from Rkatsitelli, a white grape, and Saperavi,
which produces a dark red wine that ages well. ``It's premature to
say,'' says John Schwartz, Wente's vice president/international, ``but
we hope to produce a suitable product that meets U.S. standards within
two to five years.''

 EATING RIGHT: Dish Up the Facts, Not Scare Tactics 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Last week's ``48 Hours'' did
an ``expose'' on pesticides and the safety of the American food
supply. They actually had a mother in tears because she fed her child
grapes, which the host led her to believe were highly contaminated and
dangerous. Give me a break.
</P>
<P>
While pretending to be balanced, actual air time and editing
created an alarming, though distorted, picture of killer fruits and
vegetables raining destruction on our kids. And it attempted to create
controversy where there is none (in the name of ratings?). In fact,
there is widespread agreement that our produce is safe, even for kids,
and important to their health. There is also agreement that improved
research and monitoring are in order.
</P>
<P>
Nobody wants to eat unnecessary pesticides, mostly because we fear
they cause cancer. But we have no evidence to show this, a fact
admitted by Richard Wiles of the Environmental Working Group, the
prime promoter of the unsafe food supply theory. In fact, he even said
that ``the risk from a diet of Twinkies is far greater than the risk
from a diet of fruits and vegetables, even with these pesticides on
them.''
</P>
<P>
So what we're dealing with here is fear of the unknown. That in
itself is not a bad thing. Experience tells us we'd better be asking
these kinds of questions. Research on pesticide safety should be
thorough and ongoing. But terrorizing ourselves is not in our own best
interest, especially if it puts a lid on our healthy behaviors.
</P>
<P>
What we do know is that the fruits and vegetables that we've been
eating all our lives (and for some of us that's a long time!) are our
No. 1 protector against cancer. During the show, cancer expert Dr.
Bruce Ames pointed out that people who eat a total of five fruits and
vegetables a day have half the cancer rate of those who eat less. In
the United States today, we average only 3½ servings daily. Clearly,
we should be running toward the produce department, not away from it.
</P>
<P>
On camera, Carol Browner, an administrator for the Environmental
Protection Agency, was set up as an insider dissatisfied with the
system. She said as a mother, she wanted a declaration from Congress
that our children would be protected. Then she went on to admit that
the EPA is already doing that.
</P>
<P>
A year ago, the National Academy of Sciences issued an exhaustive
report concluding that some regulatory improvements should be made to
strengthen the food safety system, but that the food supply is safe
even for children and parents should continue to encourage them to eat
a wide variety of fruits and vegetables. As Browner noted, the EPA has
begun putting the NAS recommendations into effect, including increased
monitoring for pesticide residues in foods most commonly eaten by
children. The NAS report has triggered other action as well.
</P>
<P>
The International Food Information Council, a non-profit
organization in Washington, notes that nearly half of all the produce
sold in the United States is grown in California and monitored for
safety by the California Department of Food and Agriculture. The
California Department of Pesticide Regulation, which has one of the
most stringent pesticide regulatory programs in the country, spent the
last year reviewing the NAS study. On May 17 it issued its own report,
indicating that ``the current California and federal pesticide
regulatory systems adequately protect infants and children from risks
posed by pesticide residues in the diet.''
</P>
<P>
IFIC also notes that, ``contrary to the Environmental Working Group
report, most pesticides are water soluble and can be significantly
decreased with washing. ... The best advice to consumers wishing to
further reduce their exposure to any possible pesticide residues is to
wash produce thoroughly in cold tap water; peel the outer leaves or
skin of the produce; and eat a wide variety of foods.''

 VINTAGE POINT: Choice of Wines with Grilled Food is a Personal One 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Outdoor grilling is a very personal form of cooking -- depending
more on intuition than formula.
</P>
<P>
Yes, there are barbecue cookbooks, but when was the last time you
saw someone actually follow a recipe to the letter? To do so is an
invitation to disaster, because no two fires are the same.
</P>
<P>
The choice of wines to go with grilled food is a very personal one,
too. So this -- along with the next column -- is a very personal answer
to a question about food matchups posed by my editor.
</P>
<P>
Whole books have been written about wine and food pairings, but I
have never seen one that doesn't try to make me feel like a bozo for
enjoying matchups that aren't on the approved list. So let's be clear
on one thing: These aren't rules. They are observations based on
unscientific experimentation.
</P>
<P>
At its most basic level, the answer to the question of which wine
to serve with grilled food is the same one people have used for all
foods: White wine with white meat, red wine with red meat. It's a rule
that's demonstrably flawed, but nine times out of 10 it will produce a
wine choice that's at least acceptable.
</P>
<P>
At higher levels of the game, more variables come into play and the
goal becomes more elusive. Instead of an acceptable choice, you aim
for an excellent selection or even the elusive perfect match. Seldom
do you attain it, but on occasion it's fun to play.
</P>
<P>
Sometimes I play on the higher levels, sometimes I don't. Sometimes
my choice is governed by my wanting to drink a certain wine that night
 -- regardless of whether the pairing is ``correct.''
</P>
<P>
Grilled food poses some interesting challenges other foods don't.
In grilling, the manner of cooking is part of the seasoning. It's also
a form of cooking in which the food is often consumed outdoors. That
can be an important factor in my choice of wine.
</P>
<P>
The most important factors are what and how you grill. And no two
people grill in exactly the same way.
</P>
<P>
For me, one of the most important factors is the marinade. My
marinades tend to rely heavily on herbes de Provence. That skews my
wine choices in the direction of southern France. Someone who uses
Italian seasonings might prefer Italian wines.
</P>
<P>
There are other questions:
</P>
<P>
Do you use mesquite? That can be a consideration. The extra
smokiness and spiciness could tip the balance toward a wine with those
characteristics, such as a red zinfandel.
</P>
<P>
Who's coming for dinner? Are they people who will appreciate your
best or who won't notice the difference? Do they have special
preferences?
</P>
<P>
What's the weather? Warmer weather calls for lighter, more acidic
wines, especially if you're eating outdoors.
</P>
<P>
What are the secondary courses? Sometimes they can clash with a
wine that would be your first choice with the main dish. A
down-the-list choice might be better with the overall meal. Some
vinegary potato salads, for instance, might push you toward a simpler,
lighter, more fruity wine.
</P>
<P>
Do you use barbecue sauce? If you do, you might want to stick to a
fairly simple, fruity wine because most barbecue sauces, especially
sweeter ones, tend to obliterate the flavors of dry, complex wines.
You might be better off with a simple Beaujolais Nouveau than a better
cru such as Morgon.
</P>
<P>
Is there a salsa or spicy topping? That might argue for a wine with
some residual sugar, like a Kendall-Jackson chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Grilling is a good excuse to try types of wines that aren't so
familiar. Chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon are only average in how
well they work with grilled foods; pinot blanc and mourvedre can be
exceptional. You might discover something you like better than what
you've been drinking all along.
</P>
<P>
Some wines that aren't great on their own can reach new heights
when they accompany grilled food. Some California sauvignon blancs do
just that. And some of the world's greatest wines just don't have much
affinity with grilled food.
</P>
<P>
Even so, it's difficult to generalize. One style of California
chardonnay might be a total zero with grilled salmon; another might be
a perfect marriage.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
In future columns, I'll be taking a look at some specific foods and
how they work with specific wines. Until then, don't get concerned. If
you're eating grilled food and enjoying good wine, you're already on
the right track.

 Recipes for the Grill 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here are a couple of recipes from ``The Best Covered and Kettle
Grills Cookbook Ever'' (HarperCollins, $16.95), by Melanie Barnard.
While this first recipe is for a whole side of salmon, you can also
use steaks or fillets, if you adjust the cooking time to about 5
minutes per side.
</P>
<P>
MUSTARD-DILL SALMON ROAST 
</P>
<P>
¼ cup lemon juice
</P>
<P>
¼ cup Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
¼ cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons minced shallots
</P>
<P>
½ cup chopped fresh dill
</P>
<P>
½ teaspoon freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
2½ to 3 pounds side of salmon fillet, in one piece
</P>
<P>
1 cup plain yogurt or sour cream
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon grated lemon zest
</P>
<P>
whole dill sprigs, for garnish
</P>
<P>
In a shallow dish just large enough to cover the fish, whisk
together the lemon juice, mustard, olive oil, shallots, chopped dill,
and pepper to blend well. Add the salmon and turn to coat both sides.
Cover and refrigerate at least 30 minutes and up to 3 hours. Return to
room temperature before cooking.
</P>
<P>
Combine the yogurt with the lemon zest. Refrigerate until ready to
use.
</P>
<P>
Prepare a medium fire in a covered or charcoal gas grill. Cover and
grill the salmon, skin side down, until nicely browned on the bottom,
about 10 minutes. Carefully turn over with one or two wide spatulas
and grill until the fish is just opaque throughout, 5 to 10 minutes
longer.
</P>
<P>
Serve the fish garnished with dill sprigs and accompanied by the
lemon yogurt sauce.
</P>
<P>
Serves six.
</P>
<P>
Barnard recommends the next recipe as simple starter for summer
barbecues. Use high-quality ingredients for best results.
</P>
<P>
TOMATO-BASIL BRUSCHETTA 
</P>
<P>
¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
2 large garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
1 pound ripe tomatoes, peeled, seeded and chopped
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup chopped sweet white or red onion
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup coarsely chopped fresh basil, plus leaves for garnish
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
½ teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
½ teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
8 slices crusty Italian bread, cut ½ inch thick
</P>
<P>
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
</P>
<P>
In a small bowl, combine the olive oil and garlic and let stand 15
minutes. In medium bowl, combine tomatoes, onion, basil, vinegar,
salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons garlic oil. Stir gently to mix. Let
stand 15 to 30 minutes to allow the flavors to blend.
</P>
<P>
Prepare a medium to hot fire in a covered charcoal or gas grill.
Brush both sides of the bread with the remaining 2 tablespoons of the
garlic oil. Grill until lightly toasted on one side, about 45 seconds.
Turn the bread over and quickly spoon the tomato mixture over the
toasted side. Sprinkle the cheese on top.
</P>
<P>
Grill until the bread is toasted, the cheese melted, and tomato
mixture slightly warmed, about 45 seconds. Garnish each piece with a
basil leaf.
</P>
<P>
Serves eight.

 FINDER FINDER: Homemade Biscuits So Tasty They'll Sit Up and Beg 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tasty home-baked dog biscuits can be a tail-wagging treat for the
canines you know. And, if you don't have a dog to give a bone to,
perhaps you'd enjoy baking some for a friend who does.
</P>
<P>
Shirley Wright of Baltimore requested a recipe for dog biscuits and
writes, ``I doubt if your chef would be willing to sample them but
that wouldn't be necessary because I'll bake them and try them out on
Tasha, my Bouvier des Flandres.''
</P>
<P>
Chef Gilles Syglowski had no problem finding some special tasters
of his own. His dogs, Chi Chi and Shena, ages 4 and 6, whom the chef
says are white Eskimo dogs, were more than willing to sample the
entries. ``My dogs would look at me in wonder when I offered them so
many treats,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Three responses were chosen. T.J. Leeds of Columbia, Md., Jean
Partch of Kelso, Wash., and Sally Niemann of Longmont, Colo., sent in
the chef's choices. Dogs belonging to the three responders who enjoy
home-baked offerings include a border collie, a springer spaniel,
Brittany spaniel, a Maltese and a golden retriever ``who really woofs
them down.''
</P>
<P>
NIEMANN'S DOG TREATS 
</P>
<P>
1½ cups whole wheat flour
</P>
<P>
1½ cups white flour
</P>
<P>
½ cup quick oats (soaked in warm water, just enough to cover)
</P>
<P>
¼ cup corn meal
</P>
<P>
¼ cup ground nuts (sunflower or sesame seeds work well)
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon garlic powder
</P>
<P>
4 tablespoons Brewers' yeast
</P>
<P>
4 tablespoons oil (corn or canola)
</P>
<P>
water
</P>
<P>
Combine dry ingredients. Add oil then add enough water to make a
stiff dough. Knead. Roll out and cut out in squares or in animal
shapes.
</P>
<P>
Bake 50 minutes in a 325-degree oven.
</P>
<P>
Substitutions for wheat flour may include oat, rye or other flours.
Oats may be substituted with multigrain cereals soaked or dry, or
soaked stale crackers, rice cakes or corn chips.
</P>
<P>
PARTCH'S DOGGIE BISCUITS 
</P>
<P>
3½ cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
2 cups whole-wheat flour
</P>
<P>
1 cup rye flour
</P>
<P>
2 cups bulgur
</P>
<P>
1 cup cornmeal
</P>
<P>
½ cup instant non-fat dry milk
</P>
<P>
4 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
1 envelope dry yeast
</P>
<P>
¼ cup very warm water
</P>
<P>
2 to 3 cups chicken broth
</P>
<P>
1 egg
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon milk
</P>
<P>
Mix first 7 ingredients together. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm
water then add it and 2 cups chicken broth to the flour mixture and
mix with your hands until the mixture is stiff. If necessary add the
remaining cup of broth a little at a time.
</P>
<P>
Roll dough out to ¼ inch thickness on a floured surface and cut
into shapes. Place on ungreased baking sheets. Mix the egg and milk
and brush over the biscuits.
</P>
<P>
Bake at 300 degrees for 45 minutes. Then turn off oven and leave
biscuits in closed oven overnight. Store in resealable bags. They keep
well.
</P>
<P>
LEEDS' DOG BISCUITS 
</P>
<P>
Makes about 2 dozen
</P>
<P>
1 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
1 cup whole wheat flour
</P>
<P>
½ cup wheat germ
</P>
<P>
½ cup dry milk
</P>
<P>
½ teaspoon salt (optional)
</P>
<P>
6 tablespoons shortening
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon brown sugar
</P>
<P>
1 egg
</P>
<P>
½ cup water (approximately)
</P>
<P>
Combine all dry ingredients, cut in shortening until the mixture
resembles cornmeal. Beat together the brown sugar and egg and add to
dry mixture. Add water gradually, enough to make a stiff dough. Roll
out to ½-inch thickness and cut with a cookie cutter, if possible a
bone shape.
</P>
<P>
Bake at 325 degrees for about 30 minutes or until lightly browned.
</P>

 Women Who Made a Difference 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you don't know where you've been, how do you know where you're
going?
</P>
<P>
Today, women in America have the right to vote. The right to obtain
credit. The right to jobs that for decades were strictly for men.
Reproductive rights. The right to serve in their country's military.
Rights now taken for granted. Yet, do women really understand how they
got those rights?
</P>
<P>
``A Century of Women,'' a six-hour production premiering Tuesday on
TBS, offers a glimpse of the enormous inroads and societal changes
women have affected throughout this century. It's a story filled with
sadness, joy, passion, drama, tears, death, struggle and hard-won
victories. And it's not for women only.
</P>
<P>
Narrated by Jane Fonda, ``Century of Women'' utilizes diaries,
letters and personal memoirs, never-before-seen archival footage and
photographs and interviews with the women who have made a difference.
</P>
<P>
Interwoven throughout the footage connecting past with present is
an original family drama directed by Oscar-winning documentary
filmmaker Barbara Kopple (``An American Dream,'' ``Harlan County,
U.S.A.''). The generational story stars Olympia Dukakis, Teresa
Wright, Talia Shire, Brooke Smith, Justine Bateman, Jasmine Guy and
Madge Sinclair.
</P>
<P>
The documentary is divided into three topics: ``Work and Family,''
``Sexuality and Social Justice'' and ``Image and Popular Culture.''
</P>
<P>
``When we sat around discussing the themes of the six hours,'' says
executive producer Pat Mitchell, ``we found that everybody talked
about the same issues. We thought if there was a way to mirror our
conversations in the office with the conversations in living rooms,
then people would understand this is not about history. It's also
about right now and how we are living our life. That was the genesis
of our idea -- to create that connection for the viewers that this
isn't just about what women did for the past 100 years. This is what
women are talking about now and coping with and laughing about and
crying about.''
</P>
<P>
Co-writer and executive producer Jacoba Atlas points out that a
century ago, women were beset by many of the same problems confronting
contemporary women. Turn-of-the-century writer Charlotte Perkins
Gilman, Atlas says, grappled ``with the role of men and women, how to
raise their children, how to be a writer and postpartum depression and
expectations. ...
</P>
<P>
``What we hope comes across is that we are all part of the same
piece and things don't go away. Laws change -- that's a real
accomplishment for women in this century, but I think that any woman
who has a child and has to leave their child to go to work grapples
throughout their life: Did I do the right thing? That went on in 1901
and it goes in 1994.''
</P>
<P>
Though the documentary profiles such well-known women as first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton, feminist Betty Friedan and writer Edna St.
Vincent Millay, most of the women are not household names. ``A lot of
the women who really changed the laws are just average women,'' Atlas
explains.
</P>
<P>
One such ``average'' woman was Ida May Phillips who, in the 1970s,
was a waitress with seven children. The family breadwinner, she wanted
a better job and applied to become an assembly trainee at
Martin-Marietta Co. ``They said, `You can't take this job because you
have small children,' '' Atlas says. ``So she took it all the way to
the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court said you can't tell a woman with
children she can't have a job unless you say the same thing to a man
with small children. Ida Phillips had no background to say she would
be able to go and do this, but she changed the world for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Determining who to include in the documentary was difficult. One
prominent woman not profiled is former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis. Atlas says Onassis' life had been so dissected and publicized
that the production team didn't think it could add anything to her
story, especially because the extremely private Onassis didn't give
interviews. Nor did the people close to her. ``I'm not sure we could
have offered any insights that would have done her justice,'' Atlas
laments.
</P>
<P>
Former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt, though, is prominently
featured. According to Atlas, the documentary's historical advisers
all agreed that Roosevelt was the most influential woman of the 20th
century. ``I gained tremendous respect for her,'' Atlas says. ``She
took stands that she hadn't been raised to take. She took a stand
against racism in this country. She took a stand against
anti-Semitism, both of which were prevalent in her husband's
administration. She also defended Japanese-Americans during World War
II, who were rounded up.''
</P>
<P>
For Kopple, directing fiction was not much different from making a
documentary. ``In a sense, it was a documentary because we were
searching for something that was deeper and going sort of underneath
and being intimate,'' she explains. ``When we started out to do the
fictional, we had a rehearsal the first day and all the seven
actresses sat around and read through the entire script. There was
just this explosion of all of these women suddenly being so intimate
with each other. It was if there was a bond between all of us. They
talked about their mothers and being mothers and different things that
happened to them in their lives. Every second we weren't shooting was
an excuse to talk to each other.''
</P>
<P>
``A lot of the women that we deal with in the documentary led very
public lives,'' Atlas adds. ``The women in the fictional lead what
would be called small lives. We were always concerned if the balance
would seem OK. Can the fictional family compare to (birth control
pioneer) Margaret Sanger? She was dealing on such a public level that
impacts all of our lives and would some of the small concerns that we
go through during the day hold up in the bigger world?''
</P>
<P>
Documentaries, Kopple says, ``have so much drama and passion what
we were afraid, `Would the fictional hold up to the documentary
because the documentary is so strong?' Not until we got into the
editing room did we see that yes, this is going to work.''
</P>
<P>
``A Century of Women'' airs Tuesday-Thursday on TBS; all six hours
repeat June 18.

 Part Came Very Naturally to Barry Van Dyke 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The last thing most kids want to do when they grow up is work
14-hour days with their dad. But Barry Van Dyke -- who co-stars in his
father Dick Van Dyke's ``Diagnosis Murder'' -- doesn't mind at all.
</P>
<P>
``I'd work with him any time,'' says Van Dyke, 42, from his Conejo
Valley, Calif., home. He adds that his dad, long labeled one of
Hollywood's nicest actors, is ``the best to work with, very creative.
He has a lot of integrity and he'll work no matter what, including
physical discomfort. He set a fine example. We've always talked about
working together.''
</P>
<P>
On the CBS comedy-drama, where father and son act as father and
son, Van Dyke plays police investigator Steve Sloan, who often helps
his physician and mystery-solver dad, Dr. Mark Sloan, get out of hot
water.
</P>
<P>
Producers thought it would be easier if they made the local police
investigator Sloan's son. ``He doesn't really want to arrest his
meddling dad,'' Van Dyke says, laughing. Of the Sloans' relationship,
he adds, ``It's an easy role for me to fall into. My dad pretty much
plays himself. You're seeing the real him. All that warmth and
humanity really comes across. So I tend to play myself. So their
relationship is pretty much ours.''
</P>
<P>
While Van Dyke's siblings -- one brother and two sisters -- all
considered careers in show business, he was the only one who took it
seriously.
</P>
<P>
His father, well aware of the trappings of a fickle industry,
advised his oldest son to wait.
</P>
<P>
``He wanted me to have my childhood,'' says Van Dyke. ``He told me
that if I still wanted to act after I graduated high school, then it
would be OK.''
</P>
<P>
Even though the family moved to Los Angeles when he was 9 for ``The
Dick Van Dyke Show,'' he never felt they were part of the
show-business community. ``My father didn't travel in those circles.
We were aware he was on TV and watched the show and knew it was
successful, but we didn't socialize with a lot of show-business
types.''
</P>
<P>
Yet some of Van Dyke's best memories include visits to the set of
his father's show. Watching Carl Reiner, Mary Tyler Moore and his
father work together was ``the greatest thing to see,'' he recalls.
</P>
<P>
When his father worked on location, it became the family vacation.
Trips to England and Hawaii are remembered fondly.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledges that, initially, his father's name may have helped
him get an agent, but it certainly didn't help him get work. ``There's
too much at stake for producers and casting directors to get you in on
just a name,'' Van Dyke says. Eventually, it comes down to: ``You
either perform or you don't. You work or you don't.''
</P>
<P>
And he worked, beginning as a ``go-fer'' on ``The New Dick Van Dyke
Show,'' shot at his father's small production studio in Arizona, where
the elder Van Dyke had decided to ``retire'' before being persuaded to
return to television.
</P>
<P>
Dick's son held cue cards, ran the transportation department and
basically gathered production experience. But he always wanted to be
in front of the camera. Finally, he got his wish: He landed a job as
an extra. More extra work and small parts followed.
</P>
<P>
Then he got really lucky. He landed a development deal with ABC.
Although initially pigeonholed in comedy, his father's milieu, Van
Dyke found he had more of an affinity for action-adventure. Regular
series work followed, including ``Battlestar Gallactica'' and
``Airwolf.''
</P>
<P>
And Van Dyke may be following in his father's footsteps in more
ways than one: He's got his own family dynasty in the works. During
his first foray into ``entertainment,'' Van Dyke took tickets at a
local movie theater, where he met his wife Mary, when they were both
16. They married seven years later, when Van Dyke was working as an
extra. The Van Dykes have four children: Carey, 18; Shane, 14; Wes, 9,
and Taryn, 7.
</P>
<P>
It seems his kids are eager to work with their dad too. The Van
Dyke family, who surf and dirt-bike together, is hoping to start its
own production company soon.
</P>
<P>
``Diagnosis Murder'' airs Fridays on CBS.

 TV KIDS: Colorful `Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle' Bows on Showtime 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One glimpse at the new ``Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle'' and you know that
it's a product of Shelley Duvall (``Faerie Tale Theater,'' ``Bedtime
Stories,'' ``Tall Tales and Legends''). Based on the popular
children's stories by Betty MacDonald, ``Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle'' is
filled with colorful, exaggerated sets with costumes and characters to
match.
</P>
<P>
Jean Stapleton stars as the eponymous lead character, a wise and
loving lady who lives in an upside-down house and offers uncommon
cures for such common childhood problems as ``The Not Truthful Cure,''
``The Never Want to Go to Bedder's Cure,'' ``The Fraidy Cat Cure'' and
``The Tattletale Cure.''
</P>
<P>
``Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle,'' the fifth original series Duvall has done
for Showtime, offers ``a wonderful, uninhibited creature, fearless and
able to relate to children in a perfectly comfortable, unconditional
way,'' Stapleton says. Most of all, the actress notes, Mrs.
Piggle-Wiggle is child-like, but not childish.
</P>
<P>
``She has a great sense of humor, with a lot of common sense,''
Duvall adds. Not only was she drawn to the series of books because
they were hilarious but also because they offer great information for
families.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle gets her message across without using the
wagging finger. ``She never says, `do this or do that,' '' Duvall
says. Through suggestion, the errant children always ``end up
understanding the right way on their own.''
</P>
<P>
As Stapleton puts it, ``She helps them see the light.''
</P>
<P>
The hourlong ``Special Parents' Sneak Peek'' of ``Mrs.
Piggle-Wiggle'' airs Tuesday. Beginning June 14, the show begins its
regular time slot on Showtime. For ages 2 and up.

</P>
<P>
Beginning Monday, ``Storytime'' the award-winning series produced
by KCET in Los Angeles, will be carried by PBS affiliates nationwide.
The show's goal is to show how much fun reading can be, using new
books and classic stories read aloud by celebrities. Many read to
their own children, as well as to members of the kid audience.
</P>
<P>
``What's great is that everyone is passionate about one story
that's their favorite,'' notes producer Steve Kulczycki. He hopes that
the show can encourage youngsters to find a favorite of their own.
</P>
<P>
``A lot of the show depends on the imagination of the kids,'' he
says. ``Maybe parents will do some reading with their own kids, too.''
</P>
<P>
Celebrity readers include Tom Selleck, Mariel Hemingway, John
Goodman, Shari Belafonte, A Martinez, Paul Rodriguez, Edward James
Olmos, Fred Savage, Cloris Leachman, Valerie Bertinelli, Paula
Poundstone, John Ritter, Patricia Richardson, Cindy Williams, Amanda
Plummer, Mayim Bialik, Meshach Taylor, Reginald Veljohnson, Maria
Conchita Alonso and Hector Elizondo.
</P>
<P>
Puppet Kino and host Mara (Marabina Jaimes) are joined by a new
co-host named Lucy (Anne Betancourt). Lucy adds a grandmother-like
appeal, Kulczycki points out. Twenty new shows have been added to the
original 20, which will be presented in rotation nationally. The 67
new readings bring the total of books read on the show to 137.
</P>
<P>
On June 20, Charles Dutton of ``Roc'' hosts a prime-time
``Storytime'' special. Dutton reads ``Muckey Moose,'' and Jamie Lee
Curtis reads her own book, ``When I Was Little.'' The special will
feature excerpts from the new shows.
</P>
<P>
``Storytime'' airs daily. For ages 2 and up.

 TV OLDIES: A E's `Biography' Series Adds More Portraits to Its Week 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arts Entertainment's 7-year-old ``Biography'' series has
developed into the most popular show on the cable channel that offers
an eclectic mix of documentaries, British mysteries and drama, arts
programming and vintage movies.
</P>
<P>
``Biography'' has become so successful over the last 18 months that
last week the series went from airing once a week to five times a
week. Michael Cascio, vice president of documentary programming,
explains why he believes the series, hosted by Peter Graves and Jack
Perkins, has become an audience favorite:
</P>
<P>
``Where a big network might give you 10 minutes on a person, we
will give you a whole hour,'' he says. ``You get detail. That's one
thing we can do that the other people can't. I think the reason why
`Biography' succeeds is that it lives on the name of the persons being
profiled. If you do an Alfred Hitchcock or Margaret Thatcher or
Hillary Clinton or John Belushi, these are people whom everybody knows
who they are. They have an interesting life and can sustain detail
that can last for an hour. Generally, you look for people who are
popular and have a little bit of weight behind them.''
</P>
<P>
The type and era of personalities the series chooses have evolved
since the series premiered April 6, 1987. Originally, most of the
biographies were culled from the '60s Mike Wallace-hosted CBS series,
also entitled ``Biography.''
</P>
<P>
These days, ``Biography'' profiles more than recent historical
figures. ``We have covered a lot of historical figures from the '30s
and '40s -- Churchill and Roosevelt. We will still do some of those.
But we have gone way forward. We have just done Sid Caesar and Milton
Berle. We have done Madonna and Elizabeth Taylor.''
</P>
<P>
Because production techniques have become so sophisticated,
``Biography'' also can examine the lives of such not-so-recent
historical figures as Ulysses S. Grant, George Washington and Davy
Crockett.
</P>
<P>
``You can go back in time and use drawings and paintings,'' Cascio
says. ``We can have some fun. There are a lot of people that you can
choose that are going to have audience appeal. The range is
phenomenal. We have so much fun figuring out who we want to do.''
</P>
<P>
``Biography'' aspires to give viewers a fresh look at a particular
person. ``You have an obligation to the public,'' Cascio says. ``We
are not sensationalized. We are not tabloid. Our goal is fairness -- 
not to highlight the bad stuff or just dwell on the good parts. It's
to present a balanced portrait of a person or a particular portrait.
Generally speaking, the biography is meant to deal with people in all
of their aspects and look at them as a whole, which is more difficult
to do than you might think.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Members of the Hollywood community have become more receptive about
participating in the series.
</P>
<P>
``You can do anything,'' Cascio says. ``We can do a biography, but
it's difficult to do -- not impossible -- without (the subject's) direct
approval. Even if they don't talk, they can say to their friends,
`Don't talk to them.' When we told Sid Caesar we were doing this, he
had a choice of cooperating or not, and he cooperated. He knows his
life has had ups and downs. He said, `It's better for me to cooperate
and give you my side of the story rather than have a bunch of people
telling stuff they don't know about.' ''
</P>
<P>
Famous folks, Cascio says, also perceive the documentaries as a way
to leave a legacy. `I'm sure that for Milton Berle, aside from the
fact he's a natural ham, this was a chance to get on record his life
in an hour.''
</P>
<P>
And what have been the highest-rated ``Biography'' subjects?
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Taylor, Milton Berle, Bruce Lee, Shirley Temple and
Howard Hughes.
</P>
<P>
``Right below that there is a surprising middle pack including
Napoleon and Vincent Price,'' Cascio says.
</P>
<P>
A E plans to produce between 70 and 100 original biographies this
year, including John Belushi, Sherlock Holmes (``We can do fictional
people as well,'' Cascio says), Steve Allen, Davy Crockett, George
Washington and Lucille Ball.
</P>
<P>
``Biography'' airs twice weeknights on A E. Several ``Biography''
documentaries are also available on A E Home Video.

 Binder Knows a Book Can be Judged by its Cover (New York) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Outside Henry Bookbinders, the street is polyglot and
polychrome: a wonderful collision of languages spoken by men and women
of every hue, multicolored storefronts and awnings awash in alphabets
and ideograms whose messages run in every direction.
</P>
<P>
Inside the bindery, it's only a bit less so: Two alphabets
predominate, Hebrew and Roman, and two languages, Yiddish and English
 -- although there's a smattering of medical Latin on some of the pages
as well.
</P>
<P>
Shulem Halpert, Henry's proprietor, speaks English with the
pronounced accent and imperfect grammar that marks those for whom it
is a second language. It therefore comes as something of a surprise to
learn that he is American-born. ``I come from America,'' he says. ``My
father came from Hungary. English is for me a second language. I learn
it in school; also, I catch it from the streets.''
</P>
<P>
His first language, and the one most used for communication in the
shop, is Yiddish. Halpert is a Satmar Hasid, a member of a sect so
strict and inward-looking that it exists in enclaves. The nearest is
in Williamsburg, where Halpert was born and grew up. Another enclave
is Kiryas Joel, a Satmar community in Monroe, N.Y., where Halpert
moved 19 years ago, and where he still lives with his wife and those
of his 16 children who are as yet unmarried. He is 45 years old, looks
quite a bit younger, and already has eight grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Halpert is an intense and voluble man with an aggressive sense of
humor. ``I like a joke,'' he says. ``Even a Jewish joke -- you know, a
joke that makes fun of someone? As long as it is not meant to hurt. As
long as the person is a friend.''
</P>
<P>
Bookbinding is a second career for Halpert. His first was as
shammes for the Grand Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum, who led the Satmar until
he was succeeded, in the dynastic tradition of the movement, by a
nephew. Halpert cannot find a term in English that matches shammes.
``I help him,'' he says of the rebbe, Yiddish for rabbi. ``He was an
old man. Before I was married I stayed with him -- I helped him eat,
dress. I write things. He was a real rebbe. Not a phony baloney.
Everybody liked him like a father.''
</P>
<P>
His experience with the printed word then was restricted to
parchment. ``Really, I was an artist,'' he says. ``I wrote the
parchments, the mezuzah, the scrolls.'' But after the rebbe's death
about 15 years ago, he decided to come to the bindery, which was then
run by his brother's father-in-law, Itzak Glanz.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Henry Bookbinders is precisely what the name says, a place that
binds books. It does not print them, publish them, sell or distribute
them. Customers must supply the text; Halpert supplies the outside.
</P>
<P>
Some of the outsides are probably at least as satisfying and
instructive as the material they shelter. Halpert does very nice work
with some very nice leathers. These exceed the chromatic variety of
the street outside: They are blue, green, cream, red, yellow, maroon,
white and brown of many shades.
</P>
<P>
Pretty much everything is done at least in part by hand. For
instance, Halpert stitches the books together with the aid of a big,
foot-operated sewing machine. He takes a stack of loose pages about a
quarter-inch high, sets them in place and steps on a treadle. A bank
of threaded needles descends to sew the pages together. The sewn
batches are folded and fastened into covers held down in presses until
the glue dries.
</P>
<P>
Leather is hand work, and the tools Halpert produces for a
demonstration speak eloquently of how long Henry Bookbinders has been
going about its business: Halpert hones an old kitchen knife (whose
blunt, broken blade had been all but worn away in past sharpenings) on
a whetstone that was once the size of a pound of butter. Now it is
down to the equivalent of perhaps nine ounces.
</P>
<P>
Halpert sets a scrap of leather on a granite slab whose once-sharp
edge has been dulled by long wear. He takes a board, the cardboard
that stiffens the cover of a hardbound book, and traces one corner
onto the back of the leather. He cuts a generous triangle around this
corner and bevels the edges with the razor-sharp knife. When he has
the leather slimmed down to his satisfaction, he fits it to the corner
and, using a flat, round-cornered rectangle of plastic called a bone,
bends the leather over the board and glues it down in a neat bedsheet
corner, with Elmer's glue.
</P>
<P>
This is a leather corner; Halpert will also bind -- or rebind -- 
books entirely, or partially, in leather. He will also put hubs, those
horizontal raised bands, on the spine.
</P>
<P>
It is the labor, not the material, that makes leather binding
expensive, Halpert says. He always has a selection of leather on hand
for customers, but occasionally someone will come in with his or her
own piece of leather. ``Someone brought me an old leather briefcase
once,'' Halpert says. ``It had belonged to his great-grandfather. He
wanted to make a book from it, to save something.''
</P>
<P>
Halpert offers a choice of endpapers to liven the insides of the
covers, and also will decorate the page edges. This he does with a
sponge and inks of various colors, dipping and dabbing to give the
blank edges an interesting design. You also can have the edges gilded
but Halpert sends this work out to a specialist in Soho.
</P>
<P>
Most of the books that leave Henry Bookbinders are less elegantly
clad in what the trade calls library binding -- buckram, or imitation
leather, or fabric, in the unadorned style familiar from library
shelves. Halpert uses a stamping press to print the titles on the
spines of these books in plain gold block letters.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Halpert says, Henry Bookbinders was quite well known
in the city as a binder of city documents. The company did a great
deal of work that wound up in the libraries of city hospitals. ``A lot
of journals, medical books, magazines,'' Halpert says.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Lawyers, too, are among Henry's clients; the better-off ones use a
roomful of leather to impress laymen with their prowess.
</P>
<P>
He takes on other projects as well, such as an order from a
television production company that wanted hardbound pocket folders to
hold documents, perhaps press releases. The production company was
talking in terms of 650 folders, an order that did not faze Halpert.
``I can do this,'' he says. ``I'm ready to work. I make things fast. I
have good hands.''
</P>
<P>
Still, he gives the clear impression that he often would rather be
back in Kiryas Joel, where there is no television, no radio, no
newspaper except the one published in the community, nothing but the
religion that has shaped him since birth.
</P>
<P>
``Now,'' he says, looking around his office with an uneasy smile,
``Now I want to go out from this.''

 Providence Boasts Historic Buildings and Perfect Parks (Providence) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
PROVIDENCE, R.I.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You're within earshot of the biggest bell ever
cast at Paul Revere's workshop, not far from an Ivy League university,
and in a seaport where the streets practically teem with history. Back
in Colonial days, the city hosted a tea party of sorts, destroying a
shipment of leaves as a protest against the stiff tax imposed by the
British government.
</P>
<P>
It might sound like Boston, but this is Providence, the biggest
city in little Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
Surrounding the gleaming marble dome of the Rhode Island
Statehouse, Providence packs plenty of variety. Here you'll find one
of New England's best zoos, a Little Italy atop Federal Hill, some
picture-perfect parks, and what they say is the first shopping mall in
the country -- the Arcade, built in 1828.
</P>
<P>
But the true pleasures of Providence lie on the city's East Side,
on the hillside settled more than 350 years ago by founder Roger
Williams and his followers.
</P>
<P>
Back in 1635, Williams was banished from the Massachusetts Bay
Colony for his dangerous ideas -- which included the radical concept
that Indians had a right to the land on which they had lived for
millennia. Williams left one jump ahead of a group of soldiers sent to
arrest him, and eventually he made his way up the Providence River to
a spring, where he established a community based on religious
tolerance.
</P>
<P>
Here on the patch of Providence now known as College Hill, today's
visitor will find little evidence of Williams' original community -- it
was nearly destroyed in 1676 during the Indian uprising called King
Philip's War.
</P>
<P>
Now College Hill is crowned by Brown University, and the
surrounding streets are a treasury of early American architecture. In
addition to hundreds of historic homes, there's the Cambridge-style
stretch of Thayer Street, with its ethnic restaurants, bookstores open
late into the night, vintage clothing shops and a host of places to
buy CDs, tapes or records. And there are the artsy, gallery-dotted
environs of the Rhode Island School of Design and the peaceful oasis
of the Providence Athenaeum, one of the country's oldest public
libraries with a quintessential reading room that has yet to be
discovered by a Hollywood location scout.
</P>
<P>
College Hill is a walker's domain, a part of Providence that seems
more town than city. It's built on a human scale, with few buildings
topping off at more than four stories. Trees line the streets, and
sidewalk gardens send flowery scents into the air. Here and there,
Colonial-era clapboard houses frame a distant vista -- of the
Statehouse dome, the downtown high-rises, or the steeple of some
stately church. Urban hikers on College Hill are rewarded with one
discovery after another as the picture of Providence unreels along the
city's sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
Start on Benefit Street, along the so-called ``Mile of History,''
setting out from the First Baptist Church on North Main Street at the
foot of College Hill. Head north on what was once an old Indian trail,
a pathway along which the Pequots or the Wampanoags may have portaged
their canoes.
</P>
<P>
Benefit Street is now one fine home after another, a long parade of
well-restored houses from the 18th and 19th centuries. Along the
city's most famous historic thoroughfare are Federal-style houses and
Greek Revival manses, Italianate-style homes and gambrel-roofed
Colonials. It's a riot of clapboards, pediments and pilasters in an
Easter-egg assortment of pinks and pale yellows, mustards, grays, tans
and browns -- one house is even painted the color of a pumpkin.
</P>
<P>
Many homes are the legacy of Providence's long association with the
sea. Many residents were shipping magnates, importing treasures from
the Orient or engaged in the notorious triangle trade -- shuffling rum,
molasses and slaves between Africa, the Caribbean and New England. The
houses show how lucrative the trade was.
</P>
<P>
Throughout Benefit Street's mile run, the architectural integrity
borders on the hermetic. Almost nothing detracts from the sense of the
past.
</P>
<P>
Benefit Street's historic homes were rescued from the depths of
decline -- many of the old homes had become crumbling tenements -- 
beginning in the 1950s. The success of the neighborhood restoration
effort kindled pride enough to encourage the Providence Preservation
Society to host, for the past 14 years, an annual Festival of Historic
Houses.
</P>
<P>
But Benefit Street is not the city's only historic highway. After
walking to the corner of Jenckes Street, where residents have
barricaded their houses with stones against the danger of runaway
trucks coasting down the San Francisco-style hillside, you could turn
uphill for a few blocks before turning right onto Prospect Street.
</P>
<P>
The houses along this ledge-top patrician way represent the high
point of Providence living. These stately houses, built by some of the
city's wealthiest residents in the latter 19th century, boast
landscapes decorated with perennial gardens, clipped hedges, magnolia
trees and rhododendrons.
</P>
<P>
Along the way, take a one-block jaunt down Cushing Street and stop
at Prospect Terrace. Here are panoramic views of the city skyline and
an oddly posed statue of founder Roger Williams, looking eternally
ready to disco off toward the setting sun.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Back on Prospect, a few blocks bring you to the imposing dome of
the Christian Scientist Church and the greenswards of Brown
University. Here you might head toward Thayer Street, the city's
four-block mecca for Generation X hipsters. Another locus of activity
lies along the southern end of College Hill, where cafes and
restaurants line a stretch of Wickenden Street.
</P>
<P>
Or head back downhill, toward Benefit Street and the mighty steeple
of the First Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
Head south on Benefit, to the Providence Athenaeum, a library that
traces its roots to 1753. The library, now housed in a temple that
appears transplanted from Greece, offers peaceful respite among the
antique desks and chairs, the marble busts, the paintings and the
quiet alcoves where Edgar Allan Poe courted Providence poetess Sarah
Helen Whitman 150 years ago.
</P>
<P>
With a little luck, you might get a look at one of the library's
greatest treasures -- the seven volumes of the original double Elephant
Folio edition of John James Audubon's ``Birds Of America.'' These
eye-popping illustrations -- each almost 6 feet square -- are kept in a
special climate-controlled locked vault along with other precious
works, such as the Athenaeum's incredible selection of travel and
exploration books and its collection of works by Robert Burns. Many of
these historic treasures can be traced to the library's astute
forebears -- the very patrons who left evidence of their discerning
tastes and genteel manners all over College Hill.

 As Easy as Duck Salad 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We were sitting around the other day talking about lard and I
mentioned my favorite duck ``chicharrones'' -- duck skin cooked until
the bits of skin are crisp and brown in the rendered fat. That sounds
great, someone said, but what do you do with the rest of the duck?
</P>
<P>
Well, you could have knocked me over with a tail feather. There is
so much you can do with a duck that I hardly knew where to start. If,
as the old saying goes, you can use every part of the pig but the
squeal, think of a duck as a pig built for two.
</P>
<P>
To prove my point, I decided to stop at a local Asian market to get
a nice fresh duck. The good thing about Asian markets is that the
ducks are sold with the heads and feet still on. That's nice because
the feet add a lot to the stock, and with the heads on, you get the
full neck, which is loaded with good fat. The thing to check, though,
is the cavity. Sometimes the butcher might happen to kind of
accidentally forget to leave in the liver -- strictly an accident, you
understand, but a near-criminal offense in my book. If you've ever
tasted a terrine made from duck livers -- or even duck livers just
lightly sauteed in butter -- you'll know why. They're like Little
League foie gras .
</P>
<P>
Rinse the duck well, then strip away the skin and any fat and cut
them into roughly two-inch squares or strips. Put these in a pan with
about one-quarter cup of water and cook over medium heat. Pretty soon,
the water will evaporate and all you'll have left is rendered duck fat
(the liquid will start to sizzle when this happens). Cook it until the
skin bits turn dark-brown, then retrieve them with a slotted spoon and
drain them on paper towels. Let the fat cool, then pour it through a
strainer into a glass container.
</P>
<P>
The skin cracklings, or chicharrones , are terrific lightly salted
 -- kind of like popcorn from cardiac hell. For the more cautious, they
can be used as a garnish. They're also wonderful folded into an
omelet, but don't tell them you heard it here. The duck fat you've
just rendered is one of the best cooking mediums around, with a
wonderful brown flavor. I love to fry potato pancakes in it.
</P>
<P>
The next step is to remove the two duck breasts. Using just the
point of a very sharp knife, trace the line where the keel bone
separates the breasts. Lift up gently and continue tracing the line
where the breast meat meets the ribs. When it is free, remove it to a
plate, cover it with plastic wrap and repeat on the other side.
</P>
<P>
The breasts are wonderful broiled, grilled or sauteed in a very hot
skillet. And by serving them separate from the legs, you can cook them
to only medium-rare, thus keeping them juicy and flavorful. (If you
cooked the duck with the legs, of course, you would have to have
rare-rare legs to get a medium-rare breast, and that would be very
unpleasant.)
</P>
<P>
Remove the legs from the frame and set them aside. Take off the
feet and wings and put them in a roasting pan. Chop the remaining
bones into four or five pieces and add them to the feet and wings.
Toss in a peeled whole onion and a carrot and roast at 450 degrees 30
to 45 minutes or until everything starts to brown and smell really
good. Using a slotted spoon to leave as much fat as possible behind,
remove the browned bones and vegetables to a large saucepan. Cover
well with water, add some parsley stems and whatever else you like in
a poultry stock, and let it cook over medium-high heat for a couple of
hours. Top off with water as necessary.
</P>
<P>
When the stock is deeply colored, ladle it off into a separate,
clean saucepan. At this point you will have a delicious, intensely
flavored stock. Either add a little more water to use it as a base for
a duck soup (nothing easier), or set it to cook over a low flame and
reduce it to a demi-glace, or duck jelly.
</P>
<P>
The only thing left is the duck legs. These are tendon-y and a bit
tough but very flavorful. Put them in a shallow pan with a little duck
stock. Cook, covered, over medium heat for about 20 minutes. Test with
a small sharp knife. It should slip into the meat fairly easily. Let
the legs cool, then remove the meat. Shred the meat into strips. (If
you're still cooking the stock, throw in the leg bones. What can it
hurt?)
</P>
<P>
This meat is great in salads, as part of a filling for stuffed
pastas or even for sandwiches. Do a couple of ducks and you'll have
enough to make duck sausage, if you're that ambitious.
</P>
<P>
What's the bottom line? Out of one 5½-pound duck, I got three cups
of duck fat, two cups of duck cracklings, two duck breasts (about ¼
pound each), five cups of concentrated duck stock (enough for two
quarts of soup, or 2 cups of stiff duck demi-glace), and 1½ cups
cooked, shredded meat from the legs.
</P>
<P>
And that's what you can do with a duck.
</P>
<P>
I had duck; I had arugula. How to bring them together? I wasn't
sure what my dressing would be until I opened the plastic bag of
lettuce. The intensely nutty smell of the arugula reminded me of
sesame oil, so I put together this Asian-influenced dressing.
</P>
<P>
DUCK SALAD
</P>
<P>
1½ cups cooked, minced duck leg meat from 5½-pound duck
</P>
<P>
Duck Dressing
</P>
<P>
4 cups arugula, coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
1 cup duck chicharrones, coarsely chopped from ½ of skin of
5½-pound duck
</P>
<P>
Toss together minced duck and Duck Dressing in medium work bowl
until duck is coated well. Add arugula and toss until lightly coated
and well mixed with duck. Divide among 4 chilled plates and sprinkle
chopped duck chicharrones over top. Makes 4 servings.

(ATTN: Food editors) 
 Sheila Lukins, Other Half of the Silver Palate, Writes Her Book 
 By Kathie Jenkins 
 (c) 1994, Los Angeles Times 
</P>
<P>
It's October and Sheila Lukins is feeling harassed. Her first solo
book is supposed to be published in April, and the galley proofs have
just come back from the copy editors with a thousand questions still
to be answered.
</P>
<P>
What size tomato?
</P>
<P>
What kind of apple?
</P>
<P>
How much does that fennel bulb weigh?
</P>
<P>
Now she has to go to a market, buy a bulb of fennel and weigh it.
Her physical therapist is coming by four times a week to work on the
muscles she screwed up by not walking correctly after a stroke. And
she still has to find the time to pack for a quick trip to Paris to
visit her daughter.
</P>
<P>
On top of that, she's worried about how the book will be received.
Just last spring her one-time business partner and former co-author
Julee Rosso put out a solo book, ``Great Good Food,'' and got trashed
in the press.
</P>
<P>
Rosso, who pocketed an advance reported to be $625,000, insisted
that she and four assistants tested 1,500 recipes in 10 months to
select the 800 used in the book. Her detractors said that was
impossible. No matter, Crown Publishing won't talk specifics but
reveals that the thick paperback of low-fat recipes has been a fast
seller: Since last April the book has sold about 500,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
So was the book really that bad, or was it a matter of the food
establishment -- the ``Food Mafia,'' as many call it -- taking sides in
the professional divorce of a couple that helped change the way
America eats?
</P>
<P>
In 1977, the dynamic duo -- Lukins the caterer and Rosso the
marketer -- co-founded the Silver Palate in Manhattan, one of the first
gourmet take-out shops in the country. The highfalutin home cooking
they pioneered contributed to a radical change in baby boomer eating
habits. Sauteed chicken livers with blueberry vinegar, caviar eclairs,
pizza pot pie and pesto by the quart were suddenly the rage from Boca
Raton, Fla., to Bellingham, Wash. To date, their three Silver Palate
cookbooks have sold more than 5 million copies.
</P>
<P>
By the time the partnership ended, shortly after the sale of their
shop in 1988, the pair were barely speaking. ``We were great
friends,'' says Lukins, ``It's over now.''
</P>
<P>
After the breakup, Rosso moved to Michigan and discovered yogurt
cheese, while Lukins began traveling and researching her ``All Around
the World Cookbook'' for Workman, the publishers of the original
Silver Palate books.
</P>
<P>
``I wish with all my heart that Julee's book had been nicely
received because everyone is going to want to see how the other one
did,'' Lukins says. ``I'm sure I'll be scrutinized plenty. ... And I
did not get a huge advance!''
</P>
<P>
But make a few calls to key people in the food world and you'll
find no one filing their nails in anticipation of the Lukins release,
as they did with Rosso's book. Lukins, who is 51, suffered a massive
cerebral hemorrhage in 1991 and, according to Pat Adrian, who buys
books for the Book of the Month Club, the ``Food Mafia'' rushed to be
loyal to her. It took two operations and weeks of therapy before
Lukins was able to leave a wheelchair. ``I'm happy not to be dead,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
``A lot of people were jealous of both women for a long time,''
says Adrian. ``(Blasting Rosso's book) should have been a great chatty
lunch at La Cirque rather than (the media event) it ended up being.
After all, it's just a cookbook. It's not going to change the world.''
</P>
<P>
Lukins is hoping the world is ready for Peloponnesian lamb shanks
and Moroccan marmalade, but she's not sure. Her publisher thinks so -- 
it has announced a first printing of 350,000, believed to be a record
for a cookbook. ``A huge amount of my pride is involved in this
book,'' says Lukins. ``I just didn't want this book to be another
clone (of the others). Those books are great, fun, and fine but they
are what they are. I wanted to do something different.''
</P>
<P>
Yet, the book is unmistakably in the Silver Palate format, down to
the little drawings (although Lukins wasn't the illustrator on this
book, as she was on the others) and boxed sidebars. Even the
ethnic-inspired recipes are reinterpreted for the American kitchen, in
Silver Palate fashion. There are very few ingredients called for in
the book that aren't readily available in Omaha, Neb.
</P>
<P>
But then Lukins did not intend to go around the world and bring
back the strictly authentic recipes of each country. Instead, she took
the best of what she found and created food.
</P>
<P>
Lukins developed her cooking ability when her husband, Richard, who
ran a security business, was transferred to England. A bored
housewife, Lukins enrolled in cooking classes at Le Cordon Bleu to
occupy her time. The following year, Richard was transferred to Paris,
and Lukins signed up for more classes. ``That's the way to learn,''
she says. ``In Paris I took cooking lessons and French lessons during
the day and then cooked for my darling husband at night.''
</P>
<P>
Back in New York and raising two daughters in the Dakota
Apartments, a bachelor in the building called one night in a panic. He
had invited a group over for dinner and the superintendent's wife, who
usually cooked for him when he had guests, was on vacation.
</P>
<P>
``I said, `Don't worry, I'll cook you dinner,''' Lukins remembers.
``So as was the fashion in the mid-'60s, I cooked moussaka, a Greek
salad, some stuffed grape leaves and sent it over. I charged him $50
plus the cost of the food. He ended up with a great dinner and I wound
up with $50.''
</P>
<P>
She also wound up with a new career. One of the guests at the
bachelor's dinner party was Gael Greene, restaurant critic for New
York magazine. Greene loved the party food and mentioned it to her
friend, Joan Kron, who immediately called Ellen Stern, who at the time
wrote the ``Best Bets'' column for the magazine.
</P>
<P>
``It was New York telephone at its best,'' says Lukins now. ``Ellen
Stern ran a half-page picture of me and my kitchen with a headline:
`Eat, Drink and Be Murray.''' The article portrayed Lukins as a
bachelor's best cook. ``I got 200 calls from single men,'' she says.
Six months later, the Other Woman Catering Co. was born. A year later,
Lukins teamed up with Julee Rosso to open the Silver Palate. The two
met when Rosso, an advertising executive for Burlington, hired Lukins
to cater a press breakfast introducing Oleg Cassini sheets.
</P>
<P>
In April, when ``Sheila Lukins Around the World Cookbook'' is about
to hit the stores, Lukins' mood has lifted considerably. She's almost
giddy. Vanity Fair
</P>
<P>
has just printed a flattering article on her.
</P>
<P>
A week later, when Lukins' book comes out, it's already received
its first review. Cook's Illustrated tested 30 recipes from the 450 in
the book. Its verdict: ``We were underwhelmed.'' Plus, the reviewer
brought up the Rosso book in the first paragraph. Afterward Lukins is
subdued and never mentions the story. But she wonders aloud if her
name will be linked with Rosso's forever. ``Will anyone ever write a
story about me without mentioning her?'' she asks.
</P>
<P>
``I know everyone will compare the two books,'' says Nach Waxman,
owner of Kitchen Arts and Letters bookstore, gossip central to the New
York food world. ``The Julee business will do no good for Sheila's
book.''
</P>
<P>
Lukins has been around a long time, though, and she's philosophical
about the world of cookbook publishing. ``When you put yourself before
the public and say, `this is my work, here it is,''' she says, ``I
think they look hard.''
</P>
<P>
With her book in the stores and more reviews to come, Lukins can
only wait and see what the consensus on her solo project will be. And
maybe, a few books from now, her work will be reviewed without the
mentions of her past life as half of a famous ``foodie couple.'' For
now, she is content in the knowledge that she has done the best book
she could ... on her own.

 Leprosy Is Hard to Transmit, Difficult to Treat (Los Angeles) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LOS ANGELES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was a time when Abraham Almorade would have
been quarantined by the U.S. government, exiled to a life that
excluded all except those who shared his mysterious and feared
condition.
</P>
<P>
Today, he need only visit a clinic for medication and kinship, but
his burden is by no means slight.
</P>
<P>
Almorade, 65, has Hansen's disease -- known since biblical times as
leprosy -- a difficult-to-transmit bacterial ailment that attacks body
tissue and is controlled by medication. It has slowly eroded his body
since he was diagnosed in the 1950s, covering his skin with sores and
leaving his nose deformed as the cartilage collapsed.
</P>
<P>
Sitting in an examination room recently at Los Angeles
County-University of Southern California Medical Center, where a
clinic has served Hansen's patients since 1973, Almorade discussed his
condition.
</P>
<P>
Hansen's disease has robbed his hands of sensation, making it
difficult to feel routine cuts, burns and scrapes. Without feeling,
such accidents have become major health risks and over the years have
reduced Almorade's fingers to stumps. As a precaution, he no longer
performs tasks that might injure him, such as cooking or cutting.
</P>
<P>
``I have to protect my hands,'' said Almorade, a retired soldier
from the Philippines. ``They were always numb with no sense at all and
I didn't want to hurt them. I don't cook anymore. I just eat.''
</P>
<P>
He is one of about 500 Hansen's disease patients who visit the Los
Angeles clinic regularly. Roughly 500 additional patients are served
by clinics in San Diego and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
``Leprosy is still very common around the world,'' said Dr. John
Leedon, head of infectious diseases at County-USC.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization estimated that in 1991 there were
more than 5.5 million cases worldwide, down from more than 10 million
in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
A 1992 article in the journal Clinical Dermatology, however, said
there were between 10 million and 15 million patients worldwide, most
in Africa and India, and about 6,000 in the United States, primarily
in Texas and Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
``The figures differ depending on how you count them,'' said Dr.
John Trautman of the National Hansen's Disease Center in Carville, La.
``The World Health Organization doesn't count patients who have
completed drug treatment. In the U.S., we (do).''
</P>
<P>
Scientists believe the disease is transmitted only by prolonged,
close contact with someone who is infected, although its precise route
into the body is not known. It causes a ``significant disability'' in
about 30 percent of those infected, said Dr. Thomas Rea, a
dermatologist who heads the clinic at County-USC.
</P>
<P>
Still, most of the clinic's patients function normally day to day,
often wearing long sleeves and explaining away their sores as bug
bites and other minor maladies. They are all ages, although most are
adults. Some have jobs, spouses and children. And all visit the clinic
periodically to work with doctors at controlling their symptoms.
</P>
<P>
Rea said the disease and its treatment have changed over the years,
but that the image of Hansen's disease patients has changed little.
</P>
<P>
``There's quite a stigma associated with the disease,'' he said.
``The idea of the patient being outcast, unclean and the lowest of the
low, those things are reinforced in the Bible. Despite the efforts of
the informed, cultural values seem to change very, very slowly.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional Add End)
</P>
<P>
The biblical stigma remains so great that the emotionally loaded
terms ``leper'' and ``leprosy'' are no longer used. In 13th century
France, more than 2,000 facilities were built to house sufferers
rounded up by the government during an epidemic. As late as the 1930s,
those with the disease in China were sometimes burned. And in the
United States, laws existed in the early 1900s that allowed
authorities to arrest patients.
</P>
<P>
Most were sent to so-called ``leper colonies,'' the most famous of
which was established on the Hawaiian island of Molokai in the 19th
century. Most of the colonies have been closed. The National Hansen's
Disease Center, located for almost a century in Carville, Calif., is
believed to be the only residential treatment center still operating
in the United States.

 Leprosy Dynamics Still Not Completely Understood 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though leprosy, now known as Hansen's disease, has existed since
ancient times, it wasn't until the early part of this century that
treatment other than quarantine was discovered.
</P>
<P>
Named for the Norwegian physician who pinpointed the bacteria in
1873, Hansen's disease attacks body tissue slowly, and symptoms can
take several years to appear. Left untreated, it can cause skin sores
and discoloration, pain, blindness and accidental mutilation caused by
loss of feeling in the limbs.
</P>
<P>
It is still not completely understood by scientists.
</P>
<P>
Despite its reputation as highly contagious, scientists now believe
it can be transmitted only by repeated, long-term, human-to-human
contact with a carrier. But evidence that Hansen's also can afflict
armadillos may suggest unknown transmission routes, according to
researchers.
</P>
<P>
Treatment is still developing, said Dr. Thomas Rea, a dermatologist
who heads the Hansen's disease clinic at Los Angeles County-USC
Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, the drug dapsone stopped the spread of the disease by
halting the bacteria's ability to multiply. But it did not kill the
bacteria that already existed, and scientists soon found patients who
were resistant to dapsone.
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, multi-drug therapy was recommended by the World
Health Organization. This worked so well that the organization
declared a goal to cure Hansen's disease worldwide by 2000.
</P>
<P>
But Rea doubts the goal will be reached. Belgian scientist S.R.
Pattyn released a study recently showing a 20 percent relapse rate
after 10 years of multi-drug therapy, Rea said.
</P>
<P>
``Even the most die-hard optimist would admit that's not
acceptable,'' he said. More effective drugs were discovered in 1990,
but Rea said they are expensive and have not yet been proven safe.
</P>
<P>
Though most cases are imported into the United States, stopping the
inflow has proven difficult. Patients are supposed to receive
treatment before entering the United States, said Dr. John Trautman of
the National Hansen's Disease Center, but the long incubation period
and lack of a simple detection method makes the disease hard to spot.

 Sheila Lukins' Favorite Recipes 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Sheila Lukins was asked to name her favorite recipe in her
book, without hesitating she answered, ``Peloponnesian lamb shanks.''
She recommends serving them with orzo or a vegetable couscous. The
fresh mint stirred in just before serving adds not only color but
great flavor.
</P>
<P>
SPICED PELOPONNESIAN LAMB SHANKS 
</P>
<P>
4 (1-pound) lamb shanks
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon coarse salt
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
1 medium onion, cut in half lengthwise and slivered
</P>
<P>
1 cup beef broth
</P>
<P>
1 cup dry red wine

In Turkey, the boreks weren't filled with lamb, as Lukins expected,
but rather bastirma, a cured beef covered in spices. When Lukins came
back, she made her filo pies with pastrami, a cousin of bastirma.
</P>
<P>
PASTRAMI BOREKS 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
4 Italian frying peppers, stemmed, seeded and cut into ¼-inch dice

<P>
Heat oil in skillet over low heat. Add peppers and cook, stirring
until tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Add pastrami and shallots and cook 5
minutes. Stir in tomatoes and oregano. Season to taste with salt and
pepper. Cook 5 minutes more, stirring occasionally. Stir in parsley
and cool mixture to room temperature.
</P>
<P>
Clarify butter by melting over low heat in small sauce pan. As soon
as melted, remove from heat and set aside about 5 minutes. Using
spoon, carefully remove and discard foamy white butter fat that has
risen to top. Spoon or pour off clear liquid and reserve. Discard
solids that remain on bottom of pan.
</P>
<P>
Lay filo pastry sheets on clean dish towel. Keep covered with wax
paper and dampened dish towel so filo does not dry out. Place 1 sheet
of filo lengthwise on clean work surface. Using pastry brush, lightly
cover surface with clarified butter. Cover with second sheet of filo
and brush again with butter. Cut filo into 6 (3-inch-wide) strips.
</P>
<P>
Place 1 teaspoon of filling in center of each strip. Fold corner
across filling, then continue to fold triangle, as if folding flag, to
end of strip. Tuck ends under. Place triangles as you finish them on
baking sheet. Brush with butter. Bake until golden brown, about 15
minutes. Serve hot. Makes 48 triangles.

 The `Loose Nuke Problem' 
 The following editorial appeared in Tuesday's Baltimore Sun: 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What is ``the greatest long-term threat to the security of the
United States''? According to FBI Director Louis Freeh, it is the rise
of organized crime in Russia, with its present or potential capacity
to steal nuclear weapons and fissile material that can be sold to
rogue nations or terrorist groups. ``Organized crime has unique
abilities to commit theft and diversion,'' he warns. ``This is why we
must take action before a major nuclear incident occurs.''
</P>
<P>
The action he contemplates is establishing an FBI office in Moscow
itself, there to work with Russian police and security officials to
combat a wave of criminality engulfing the states of the former Soviet
Union. Freeh pronounces the United States ``lucky'' that no illegal
diversions of nuclear-weapons material have yet occurred, but even
that cannot be verified absolutely in light of the intermeshing of
Russia's civilian and military nuclear programs as well as the
notoriously inadequate protection of its facilities. It is one of the
anomalies of this post-Cold War era that once the Soviet police state
collapsed, along with its reliance on terror and intimidation, crime
has had a heyday.
</P>
<P>
Freeh's outspoken warnings before a Senate subcommittee mark a
shift in the Clinton administration's handling of this scary matter.
Heretofore, officials have alluded to the problem in muted fashion for
fear that publicity might encourage criminal elements to seek
possession of salable nuclear materials.
</P>
<P>
With The Atlantic Monthly running a cover story on criminality in
Russia and various European publications reporting near-successful
test attempts to buy warheads from Russian military officers, it
appears that the new policy is to confront the issue head-on. If so,
it is for the best.
</P>
<P>
The ``loose nuke problem'' has added new dimensions to the long
crusade to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
Its central feature, from the beginning, was to stop as many nations
as possible from going nuclear. With the collapse of the Soviet Union,
three new nuclear-weapons states (Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus) had
to be prodded, so far with mixed success, to turn their facilities
over to Russia. There also was worry about a ``brain drain'' of Soviet
nuclear scientists to the likes of Libya, Iraq, Iran and North Korea.
And, finally, there was the criminal problem, raising what FBI
Director Freeh calls the ``dreadful possibilities'' of having stolen
nukes fall into the hands of terrorists bent on using them against the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Russia is the site of thousands of nuclear warheads and hundreds of
tons of weapons-grade plutonium and enriched uranium (the stuff of
nuclear bombs). Clearly, it will require monumental cooperation
between American and Russian authorities to keep nuclear materials out
of the hands of international organized-crime operations. With
governmental authority eroding in Russia, the prospects are not
encouraging.

 New Approach in War on a Tenacious Plague 
 The following editorial appeared in Tuesday's Los Angeles Times: 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cruel in its manifestation, fiendishly enigmatic in its
pathogenesis, AIDS marches on relentlessly. Already 360,000 cases have
been diagnosed in the United States alone; 220,000 people have died.
Worse is sure to come soon. It is about 10 years since the disease was
first identified. With its stealthy 10-year latency, that means
thousands infected by the HIV virus in the mid-1980s, before they
learned how to protect themselves, will soon start to develop symptoms
and die. Despite massive research, the tiny virus has outwitted the
best scientific minds. Little progress has been made in finding a cure
or vaccine.
</P>
<P>
The time has come for new thinking, new approaches. A lucid and
logical framework for the future comes now from Bernard N. Fields of
the Harvard Medical School. In a paper in the British journal Nature,
he argues that AIDS is far more complex than anyone imagined and calls
for a broadening of research and a return to basic science.
</P>
<P>
In other words, valuable time has been lost in following narrow
hunches for an easy cure, some magic bullet. ``The real challenge,''
he writes, ``is to put aside politics and the illusion of easy answers
so that we can concentrate on studies that offer a real possibility of
working.'' He adds: ``In our zeal to control AIDS, we have invested
enormous resources in the search for drugs and vaccines. This may have
been reasonable 10 years ago, but is no longer.''
</P>
<P>
Wise words, but politically difficult. A huge medical, corporate,
bureaucratic and political infrastructure is committed to testing new
remedies and vaccines. Even as Dr. Fields' words were published, the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases appeared,
reluctantly, to be ready to spend tens of millions of dollars on human
tests of two vaccines even though laboratory tests showed they had no
effect on HIV viruses isolated from infected people.
</P>
<P>
In their legitimate outrage over the federal government's shameful
slowness to act on AIDS during the last decade, activists forced quick
approval of unproven drugs. As a result, the drug AZT was widely
prescribed to delay the onset of disease in infected people who had
not yet developed symptoms. Only later did further studies show it was
useful only in people with advanced disease.
</P>
<P>
AIDS has dashed hopes that it could be controlled as polio was.
That devastating epidemic too was caused by a virus. Once it was
identified, a vaccine could be developed. Alas, as Fields notes, the
HIV virus is far more complex, unpredictable and nefarious. Fields
calls for expanded research in related areas (such as on other
infectious agents), on basic study of the early events of HIV
infection and on the so-called opportunistic infections that often
fell AIDS patients. ``AIDS is a novel disease requiring new paradigms
and a new conceptual framework,'' he argues. ``We must give
serendipity (and reasoned scientific redirection) a chance to join the
war on AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
His notions are embraced by many AIDS experts, including Dr. Mervyn
F. Silverman, president of the American Foundation for AIDS Research,
and Dr. William Paul, new director of the Office of AIDS Research at
the National Institutes of Health. Some activist groups, such as the
New York ACT UP organization, continue to focus on a speedy cure and
support a bill in Congress that would set up a focused research
program outside of the NIH. But other AIDS groups, though divided,
have begun to see that such narrow approaches have so far proved
counterproductive. We need a new beginning on AIDS.

 ``Blacker Than a Thousand Midnights,'' by Susan Straight 
 (Hyperion, $21.95, 388 pp.) 
 Reviewed by Carole Goldberg 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everything smolders in Rio Seco. In this fictional California town,
the setting for Susan Straight's second novel, ``Blacker Than a
Thousand Midnights,'' the torrid weather, the prickly relationships
between a young black man and his wife, family and friends and the
friction between the races all simmer just below the flashpoint.
Straight carefully piles on the tinder and the reader waits to see
whether it will spontaneously combust.
</P>
<P>
The infernal weather makes life tough for young Darnell Tucker, but
he can deal with the choking heat. What he must really struggle to
cope with is impending fatherhood, a marriage off to a very rocky
start, a father-in-law who won't talk to him, friends who are risking
their lives by ``slinging 'caine'' and the lack of a decent job.
</P>
<P>
Darnell, who is 20, wants to do the right thing. Circumstances
conspire to make that a heroic effort.
</P>
<P>
When they marry, his wife, Brenda, is pregnant -- and is the
breadwinner as well. She loves him, but she is overwhelmed by
exhaustion and anxiety. Their working-class parents make it clear to
Darnell that he must find a job, and fast.
</P>
<P>
That's not so easy to do. Darnell's great ambition is to become a
full-time firefighter, part of a crew that ranges through the Los
Angeles hills, short-circuiting the small fires that can roar into
major disasters.
</P>
<P>
Brenda knows that Darnell is infatuated with firefighting and fears
she'll lose him to this deadly fascination. But the best he can do is
part-time work, and even that dries up, even as the drought-struck
hills threaten to burst into flame.
</P>
<P>
He tries work as a security guard, but in an episode of mistaken
identity, winds up face-down on the pavement with a police dog
slashing at his leg.
</P>
<P>
He does bull work for his father, a hauler of tree stumps who'll
take any yard-cleaning project that comes his way.
</P>
<P>
Not much feels right for Darnell. His friends, Leon and Louis, are
caught up in drug selling. Brenda is so consumed by love for their
newborn daughter, Charolette, that she has very little time and energy
left over for him.
</P>
<P>
But he perseveres. And in a flash of entrepreneurship, he finally
comes up with an idea that works, while neatly playing off the state
of race relations in his part of the world. Passing himself off as a
foreman, he hires Mexicans and pretends they all work for an Asian
landscaper, the better to be accepted by white homeowners.
</P>
<P>
Straight, who is white and whose previous book was ``I Been in
Sorrow's Kitchen and Licked Out All the Pots,'' does a lot of things
right in this novel. She creates believable characters, and she does
black dialect well.
</P>
<P>
Yet, despite admiration for Darnell's dogged persistence and
pleasure when he overcomes his poor prospects, something is missing.
</P>
<P>
The cleansing fire - in the hills, in the marriage, in the streets
- never quite flares. This is a story of the rewards of control, but
some readers may feel almost cheated that a fiery release, hinted at
throughout the book, never comes.

 Cruise Ships Follow Airlines With Bonuses for Frequent Customers 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is cruising getting more like flying when it comes to passenger
incentives?
</P>
<P>
Most cruise lines reward their frequent passengers with perks like
special discounts and private parties, but Cunard is about to launch a
plan that sounds like a seagoing version of the airline frequent-flier
programs.
</P>
<P>
Passengers who sail on any of 10 Cunard ships will earn Cruise
Miles that can be redeemed for awards ranging from upgrades to free
voyages. Cruise Miles will be awarded on a per-person, per-day basis
according to ship, grades of accommodation and length of trip. Thus,
the higher your cabin category and the longer the cruise, the more
points you'll earn.
</P>
<P>
How fast will Cruise Miles add up? On a five-star ship such as the
Queen Elizabeth 2, Columbia-class passengers (the lower first class
tier) will earn 200 miles a day. On Cunard Crown vessels (which are
less formal than the QE2, Sea Goddesses and other top-of-the-line
ships), you'll earn 50 Cruise Miles a day in a mid-priced inside
cabin, 100 a day in a mid-priced outside cabin, 150 a day in a deluxe
stateroom -- thus 250, 700 or 1,050 Cruise Miles for a seven-day
voyage.
</P>
<P>
Once you've accumulated 600 Cruise Miles you can redeem them for a
one-category upgrade on a seven-day trip on a Cunard Crown ship. It'll
take 5,000 Cruise Miles to get a free seven-day sailing on a Crown
vessel -- which you can earn by taking just one 11-day voyage on one of
the deluxe Sea Goddesses. However, if your style -- and pocketbook -- 
allow only an annual one-week cruise in the budget category, you're
never going to earn a freebie within the seven-year limit Cunard has
set.
</P>
<P>
Seabourn Cruise Line has offered a somewhat similar incentive plan
for its frequent sailors since 1988. Passengers who've made one voyage
automatically become members of the line's Seabourn Club, which offers
fare reductions for accumulated days at sea. For example, after 28
days of sailing -- typically two Seabourn cruises -- you'll get a 25
percent savings on your next 14-day trip; after 70 days, you'll get a
50 percent reduction on your next 14-day journey; after 140 days, you
qualify for a free 14-day cruise. Seabourn's all-suites ships offer
luxury voyages (the average per-person tariff is $830 a day), but lots
of passengers have nevertheless qualified for freebies, according to
spokesman Ernie Beyl. Seabourn also has a pay-in-full prepurchase
program called World Fare, which offers substantial savings to
travelers who buy 45, 60, 90 or 120 days at sea up to three years in
advance. Via World Fare, you can reduce the average daily cost to
about $500-plus, Beyl said.
</P>
<P>
Royal Viking, which claims a 66 percent repeat rate on its cruises,
gives gifts of merchandise after a certain number of sailings. Members
of its past-passengers Skald Club (named for the well-traveled Viking
historians who made continual voyages and always returned home with
intriguing tales) also get an extra 5 percent reduction on top of the
standard 15-percent early booking discount. And several annual Royal
Viking ``reunion cruises'' offer a variety of perks for Skald Club
members.
</P>
<P>
Other lines said they're taking a new look at their incentive
programs. Meanwhile, Radisson is offering a $1,000-per-person discount
to Radisson Hotel guests who book a seven- or eight-night Radisson
Diamond Mediterranean cruise within 30 days of check-in. The promotion
also includes an additional $250-per-person shipboard credit that can
be used toward shore excursions, drinks, boutique purchases and beauty
and spa services. Radisson says the discount reflects savings of
nearly 25 percent off the full fare, which normally totals $4,295 for
a seven-night voyage, $4,895 for eight-night voyages. The deal is
available to Radisson Hotel guests until July 31 for sailings between
June 10 and Nov. 5.

TRAVEL PLANNER: Packages to Finland Range from Cities to Tundras 
</P>
<P>
By Marc Cottone 
</P>
<P>
(c) 1994, Newsday 
</P>
<P>
The Finnish Tourist Board is offering more than 40 package tours
for travelers in Finland this year that cover everything from coastal
cities to the tundra of the Arctic Circle. The ``Midnight Sun
Flight,'' for example, takes tour members from Helsinki to Rovaniemi,
capital of Lapland, for a day of 'round-the-clock sunlight. Take in
the native Lapp culture with a reindeer lasso-throwing contest, cross
the Arctic Circle and later enjoy a traditional Lapp dinner. The
one-day/one-night package, available June 1-July 31, is $336 per
person, double occupancy, and includes round-trip airfare from
Helsinki and accommodations. Or try the ``Tornionjoki River
Adventure'' that offers two exciting trips near the Arctic Circle that
include white-water rafting, fishing, a visit to a Lapp lumberjack
mill -- even a visit to Santa Claus at his Arctic Circle workshop.
Starting at $290 per person, double occupancy, fo r the river raft,
the tour includes roundtrip air from Helinski, accommodations and
meals. Package trips are available for coastal cities tours and rural
farmhouse sojourns. There's even a tour to Tankavaara, home of the
Goldpanning World Championships. Call your travel agent or Finnway at
(800) 526-4927.

organization that seeks to promote understanding between cultures
through hands-on volunteer projects, has several volunteer slots open
this summer on two- and three-week teams headed for Kenya, Guatemala
and Belize. You don't need foreign language ability -- only a
willingness to experience and accept new cultures -- and the trips are
open to all ages and skills. Trip-related expenses, including airfare,
food and lodging are tax-deductible, according to the group. Programs
range from $990-$1,300, plus air fare. A number of partial
scholarships are available. For more information, call (800) 644-9292.

from New York to Fort-de-France in Martinque this summer for just
$969-$1,250 per person, double occupancy, depending on choice of
hotels. The ``Fly/Drive Explorer'' package includes airfare,
seven-nights' accommodations, daily breakfasts and a car for five days
with unlimited mileage and maps with suggested itineraries. A golfer's
package includes the same basic items plus greens fees for a week at
the 18-hole Empress Josephine Country Club, designed by Robert Trent
Jones Sr., where the fairways roll right down to the town's colorful
waterfront. Call (800) 765-6065.

A RECIPE FOR FUN: Spend a holiday immersed in culinary philosophy
and gastronomic delights on a five-day ``Going Solo in the Kitchen''
vacation through Regatta Travel. Under the direction of Jane Doerfer,
noted cooking teacher and author, participants will learn the
techniques of cooking for one in a modern school that operates out of
a 19th-Century plantation house in Apalachicola, Fla. Students prepare
quick meals such as swordfish in sweet-sour tomato sauce and butterfly
chicken with sweet potatoes and onions, all with an eye on healthful
and non-wasteful recipes. During afternoons off, students can walk or
swim at nearby St. Georges Island Beach or fish for a bass that might
wind up on the dinner platter. Classes are limited to 12. Four
sessions are held through December, the first from June 12-17. Price
is $875 per person; air fare is extra. Call (800) 445-7685.

 ``The Chamber,'' by John Grisham (Publisher, $24.95, 486 pp.) 
 Reviewed by John M. Moran 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Moviegoers love films based on John Grisham novels.
</P>
<P>
Two of his books -- ``The Firm'' and ``The Pelican Brief'' -- became
box-office hits thanks to Grisham's action-packed plots, and ``The
Client,'' starring Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee Jones, hits theaters
in July.
</P>
<P>
So it's no surprise that Grisham's latest work, another legal
thriller called ``The Chamber,'' is Hollywood-bound as well. Producer
Ron Howard acquired the rights while the book was still being written.
</P>
<P>
Set mostly in Mississippi, ``The Chamber'' chronicles the desperate
efforts of Adam Hall, a young Chicago lawyer, to block the gas-chamber
execution of his grandfather, 70-year-old Sam Cayhall.
</P>
<P>
Cayhall, a lifelong member of the Ku Klux Klan, was convicted of a
1967 bombing that maimed a Jewish civil rights lawyer and killed his
two children.
</P>
<P>
Cayhall has only four weeks left to live unless grandson Hall, who
hates the death penalty as much as he does Cayhall's crimes, can
devise a successful appeal. The tempo builds as the execution date
approaches.
</P>
<P>
Besides exploring death-penalty issues, Grisham uses ``The
Chamber'' to discuss the social conditions that existed during the
height of civil rights tensions in the South. He pulls no punches on
the bigotry and hate that marked that era.
</P>
<P>
This aspect of the tale is recounted through flashbacks and the
memories of the family members, law-enforcement agents, and victims
that Hall encounters in his bid to save his grandfather's life. In the
process, Hall, whose own father had fled the violence but could not
escape it, learns about the Cayhall family's role in the hatred and
bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
The death penalty and the civil rights struggle are potential gold
mines for a novelist. Too bad Grisham fumbles the opportunity to make
``The Chamber'' something more than summer adventure reading.
</P>
<P>
Despite its strong plot line, the book is marred by a variety of
weaknesses, including contrived dialogue, cliched characters and
dead-end subplots.
</P>
<P>
Conversations about the death penalty often turn into two people
lecturing each other. Government officials supporting the death
penalty are portrayed as either cold functionaries or cynical
opportunists. All reporters are ignorant vultures interested solely in
sensationalism.
</P>
<P>
Worse, the plot often seems downright deceptive. At least two
significant characters set up for key roles in the novel's climax turn
out to be irrelevant to the outcome. So pages of foreshadowing are
revealed as having been used to dupe the reader.
</P>
<P>
There's also a strange lack of realism in the novel's descriptions.
Grisham, a Mississippi resident, obviously has gone to great pains to
study life in prison, on death row in particular. But when characters
move to the Mississippi countryside, they seem lost in a generalized
Southern landscape, not rooted in a distinct setting.
</P>
<P>
None of this, however, is likely to hamper the book's chances of
becoming a successful and entertaining movie. Two-hour adventure
movies are slavishly devoted to plot and have little time left for
subtleties or character development.
</P>
<P>
Those who have enjoyed Grisham's earlier works, which include ``A
Time To Kill,'' should have no qualms about diving into ``The
Chamber.'' It's good for a beach or an airplane or a backyard deck
chair.
</P>
<P>
But those new to Grisham might want to preview his earlier work at
the library before investing $25 in a new hardcover. That, or wait for
the movie.

 BOOKS FOR KIDS: Favorite Fairy Tales Are Spun in New Way 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When it comes to putting a wacky spin on a familiar story, Kevin
O'Malley is one of the best. O'Malley made a splash with ``Froggy Went
A-Courtin', '' followed by ``Who Killed Cock Robin?''
</P>
<P>
He flew solo on those two books, as well as ``Bruno, You're Late
for School!'' and ``The Box.'' But he has gone from author/illustrator
to illustrator in his latest, ``Cinder Edna,'' written by Ellen
Jackson (Lothrop, Lee Shepard, $15, 32 pp., ages 4 and up).
</P>
<P>
The story leaves O'Malley plenty of room to have fun with the
illustrations. The jokes he slips in are the funniest parts of the
book, which would be funnier if it wasn't hammering home a message.
</P>
<P>
Not that the moral is a bad one.
</P>
<P>
Cinder Edna happens to live next door to Cinderella. Both have a
cruel stepmother and wicked stepsisters. When Cinderella has done all
the work around the house, she sits in the cinders, thinking about her
troubles. When Cinder Edna is done slaving for her stepmother and
stepsisters, she mows lawns and cleans parrot cages for neighbors, at
$1.50 an hour.
</P>
<P>
Cinderella is beautiful. The industrious Cinder Edna ``wasn't much
to look at. But she was strong and spunky and knew some good jokes -- 
including an especially funny one about an anteater from
Afghanistan.''
</P>
<P>
Cinderella gets to go to the ball courtesy of her fairy godmother.
Cinder Edna has saved up her money to put a dress on layaway. While
Cinderella rides in her pumpkin coach, Cinder Edna takes the bus to
the ball.
</P>
<P>
Empty-headed Cinderella falls for the vain prince. Cinder Edna hits
it off with the prince's younger brother, a dorky sort who lives in a
solar-heated cottage and runs the recycling plant. Both couples end up
getting married, and there's no doubt about who lives happily ever
after.
</P>
<P>
A take-off on traditional fairy tales lets readers take off on a
wild trip in ``Come Back, Jack!'' by Catherine and Laurence Anholt
(Candlewick Press, $12.95, 32 pp., ages 3 and up).
</P>
<P>
One day a little girl who doesn't like books is playing outside
with her little brother, Jack, who loves books. Next thing she knows,
Jack is climbing into one of his books, and she has to scramble to
crawl in after him.
</P>
<P>
Once inside the book, she runs down a hill to find a little girl
named Jill, a spilled bucket beside her. ``Jack fell down -- and now
he's run away,'' Jill says.
</P>
<P>
Jack's sister rushes to find him. She gets to the house that Jack
built, only to find that he has already left. He was last seen jumping
over a candlestick.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the trail leads her to the giant's castle, where she finds
Jack sitting in a corner, eating a Christmas pie. They barely escape
down the beanstalk in time. Once they're safe, back at home in the
garden, she says, ``Well, perhaps books aren't boring after all!'' The
endpapers include the nursery rhymes referred to during the children's
romp through the pages.
</P>
<P>
A sequel to Humpty Dumpty? No, it's not filled with omelet recipes.
``Little Lumpty,'' by Miko Imai (Candlewick, $12.95, 32 pp., ages 4
and up), is an original story about a little egg growing up in the
town of Dumpty, where young eggs play by the wall that Humpty Dumpty
fell from long, long ago.
</P>
<P>
Lumpty dreams of climbing the wall, even though he knows it's
forbidden. Finally, he gets his courage up, finds a ladder and makes
it to the top. He is thrilled -- until he looks down and his legs shake
and he can't make it back down the ladder.
</P>
<P>
He knows he'll be in trouble when his mother finds out what he has
done. He remembers Humpty Dumpty's great fall and starts crying.
Finally, he gets his courage up and yells for help. All the eggs in
town rush out, and he is rescued. He tells his mom he's sorry, and she
hugs him.
</P>
<P>
Any kid who has broken the rules, thrilled in the adventure of it
all and then found herself in big trouble will identify with Lumpty.
The best part is that there's no grown-up moral at the end. Lumpty,
who dared to chase his dream, is safe in his bed.
</P>
<P>
``But I still love that wall,'' he whispered to the moon just
before he fell asleep.

 THE LIGHTER SIDE: Purple Haze: The Many Shades of Barneyness 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Possibly enough has been said about Barney, but has anything been
said about those who are not Barney?
</P>
<P>
My son Joey and I were at a festival last weekend where we
encountered not Barney but ``a purple dinosaur.''
</P>
<P>
He was roughly the size of Barney. He was roughly the color of
Barney, although I would have pegged him somewhere between plum and
aubergine, whereas Barney has this thing happening where he modulates
between soft true fuchsia and almost a zinfandel.
</P>
<P>
Sometimes I think it's a shame I don't ever get to give the police
any descriptions.
</P>
<P>
Also, Barney apparently has access to some moth-proofing that is
not widely available.
</P>
<P>
We looked at not-Barney. He did tell us he loved us. He did not
tell us we loved him. He did not offer any explanation for himself.
</P>
<P>
Neruda's, ``It so happens I'm tired of being just a man,'' would
have been nice.
</P>
<P>
Joey is 4 and doesn't like Barney, because Barney is not engaged in
the important work of this life, which is pounding really hard for 22
minutes a clip on radioactive Japanese armadillos, as per ``Mighty
Morphin Power Rangers,'' a show that takes the old saw about there
being only seven basic plots in all storytelling and divides it by
seven.
</P>
<P>
But even though he disdains Barney as the sort of appeaser who
would hand the Sudetenland over to the isotope-leaching weaselcobras
without so much as a kick-punch, Joey determined that he was in the
presence of somebody famous, and, just the way you or I might not
immediately turn our backs on, say, Marge Schott or John McLaughlin,
he hung with the Barney-tribute-act until it was clear that there was
not going to be a glow of any kind.
</P>
<P>
Plus it was one of those deals where they want about $4.50 for a
Polaroid of you and (in this case) somebody who wasn't really in a
position to claim to be the entity he was impersonating. It would have
been like paying a lot of money to see Demi Moore as Ophelia.
</P>
<P>
I did wonder: Can this be legal? No way can the Barney people sew
up the whole idea of being a purple dinosaur, but how close to
Barneyness can you get before you cross some kind of line? The
Newfoundland muzzle, the Norville eyes ... these must be worth a call
to Mackenzie Brackman.
</P>
<P>
There are already lawsuits flying around about the Barney song. In
a couple of years, Barney will be an entire semester at most law
schools.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, almost gratifyingly, another Barney is back. ``The
Flintstones'' movie opened last weekend. It made me think about the
original Flintstones and how Barney Rubble is the defining symbol of
why they weren't any good. Because, unlike Ed Norton in ``The
Honeymooners,'' Barney is not connected to an alternate reality. Ed's
sewer-nourished transcendentalism is kind of the escape window from
all those peevish Kramden realities. But Barney is just kind of there.
Like Barney. And not-Barney.
</P>
<P>
And then I thought: If I have time to think about this, I need a
night job.
</P>
<P>
Now I come to find out that -- head-spinningly -- David Geffen has
optioned the rights to make a Barney (the dinosaur) movie.
</P>
<P>
Well, he might have actually been righter than Redford for ``Out of
Africa,'' but what exactly is Barney (not to mention those
insufferable children) supposed to do for 90 minutes?
</P>
<P>
Maybe a ``Stardust Memories'' thing. Maybe Barney doesn't want to
be instructively affirming (or whatever) anymore, but his fans won't
let go. His head is in a different place. He's got chick problems.
(``Four Weddings and a Reptile.'')
</P>
<P>
Maybe then, Barney finishes alone, on a hilltop in L.A., like
Beatty at the end of ``Shampoo.'' And, wait, maybe he is reciting
Neruda:
</P>
<P>
``For a long while I've pondered them now -- these big legs of
mine:
</P>
<P>
with infinite tenderness, curious, with my usual passion -- 
</P>
<P>
as if they belonged to a stranger ...''
</P>
<P>
Maybe I need some rest.

 ``Shot in the Heart,'' by Mikal Gilmore (Doubleday, $24.95, 
 402 pp) 
 Reviewed by Owen McNally 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
``Shot in the Heart'' is Mikal Gilmore's gut-wrenching exorcism of
the demons that have ravaged his doomed family, especially his oldest
brother, the cold-blooded killer Gary Gilmore, who embraced death by a
firing squad in Utah in 1977.
</P>
<P>
A pop-culture writer for Rolling Stone magazine, Mikal Gilmore has
created a powerful portrait of his family's toxic genetic pool that
has spawned Snopes-like figures whose epic struggles with crime and
punishment could populate great works by Faulkner or Dostoevski.
</P>
<P>
His volatile clan has left a legacy of centuries of domestic
brutality, madness and tyranny. Its heritage of dysfunctionalism
culminated in Gary Gilmore's execution after he murdered two Mormons
in cold blood in Utah.
</P>
<P>
Gary Gilmore's crusade to have himself executed by a firing squad
as his blood atonement for his sins made news around the global
village. His bizarre story became fodder for Norman Mailer's masterly
``The Executioner's Song,'' later adapted into a first-rate TV movie.
</P>
<P>
Mikal Gilmore wrote this agonizingly candid memoir in hopes of
finding a key that would unlock ``the true history of (his) family and
how its webwork of dark secrets and failed hopes helped create the
legacy that, in part, became (his) brother's impetus to murder.''
</P>
<P>
Mikal, 43, says it was a life-and-death struggle for him to break
with his family's unnatural bent for violence and create a sane,
straight life. But, he confesses, he has been dizzyingly close to the
murderous abyss that swallowed up his brother. He writes: ``There were
days during this time (before Gary was executed) that I wanted to kill
the world. I supposed that in those months I was finally like my
brother in all respects except one: He was destroyed enough to pull
the trigger, and I was not.''
</P>
<P>
Mikal finds a number of cultural and sociological culprits to blame
for the curse of the house of Gilmore.
</P>
<P>
Among these is the bungling prison system, which, he says, makes
criminals even more unfit for life outside.
</P>
<P>
Mormonism, the faith of Gary's mother, is also in some way
culpable, Mikal says, because of its early rugged history on the
blood-soaked frontier and its teaching of blood atonement -- the
concept that some sins are so heinous, they can be atoned for only by
the shedding of the sinner's blood.
</P>
<P>
Gilmore takes a Calvinistic view of fate, coming down hard on the
side of predestination. ``Gary's fate was finished at about the
instant in which my parents conceived him,'' he writes. Inescapable
fate, inexplicable appearances of malevolent ghosts and revelations of
shameful family secrets recur as motifs throughout this account of one
man's family.
</P>
<P>
But finally, the central villain is the tyranny of the family
itself, a kind of inhuman bondage that Mikal Gilmore hopes to shatter
by bringing everything out into the light of day. So he outs
long-closeted secrets, festering fantasies and fictions that were the
Crazy Glue bonding his loony loved ones together.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps in a bit of wishful thinking, Mikal implies that his family
is not that much of an aberration from more typical-seeming American
families, which also have dark secrets lurking under their roofs.
</P>
<P>
Families have their flaws. But to emblazon the mark of murderer and
child-and-wife abuser upon the brow of all families smacks of the sort
of cruel and unusual punishment Mikal's brutal father loved to inflict
on his boys' buttocks.
</P>
<P>
Gilmore stumbles in other ways.
</P>
<P>
His prose sometimes overheats, or strikes a gratingly banal note or
portentous pose.
</P>
<P>
Even worse, as his family saga focuses more on him, its pace
fizzles out in mercilessly boring salvos of I's, as in I did this, I
did that.
</P>
<P>
And after reading hungrily about Mikal's con-man dad, his mad mom
and fascinatingly flawed brothers, it's a drag to read about his
troubles. Does anybody care that he had to take Dalmane to help him
sleep or that his ``meetings and couplings'' with one girlfriend
``took on a special intensity''?
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Gilmore's account of his ascent from this hell of
family life is moving and memorable. If the work doesn't bring him the
redemption he sought, its confessional tone in this Age of Confession
might well bring monetary salvation at cash registers across the
nation.

 ``The Serpent's Gift,'' by Helen Elaine Lee; 
 (Atheneum, $21, 374 pp.) 
 Woods runs her own consulting firm and is the co-author of ``I, Too, 
 Sing America: The African American Book of Days'' and co-editor of 
 the forthcoming ``I Hear a Symphony: African Americans 
 Celebrate Love.'' 
 Reviewed by Paula L. Woods 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a former member of corporate America who eventually turned to
writing, I was extremely intrigued by this novel written by Washington
attorney Helen Elaine Lee. How many people have I met, fueled by the
success of John Grisham or Michael Crichton, who report slaving away
at their portable ``Disclosure''? Was Lee, I wondered, another one of
these misguided souls who sit at computers trying to write the next
``Pelican Brief'' and would be better off writing legal briefs than
literature?
</P>
<P>
Should she be given that sage advice, ``Honey, don't quit your day
job''?
</P>
<P>
But after a marathon reading of ``The Serpent's Gift'' while I
should have been enjoying the scenery on vacation, I wanted to advise
Lee to start writing that resignation letter. For ``The Serpent's
Gift'' marks the debut of an important new voice on the fictional
landscape.
</P>
<P>
Although there's nary a lawyer or murder weapon in sight, Lee has
nevertheless created an emotional, suspenseful page-turner. Her
terrain is the human heart; the first two pages of the book alone
contain one of the most haunting deaths in recent memory. This passing
deeply affects young Vesta Smalls, creating in her a fear of making a
critical misstep, of yielding to ``the power of the small deed to rip
the sky apart, and return it to seamless blue.'' And as the novel
fast-forwards to an aged Vesta, now encased in tattered scarves and
surrounded by plastic-covered furniture, you sense that she's paid
some terrible price for a misstep, an accident long ago.
</P>
<P>
There's a saying that goes, ``When one door closes, another opens.
'' For Lee's characters, the closing off represented by the accident
and the violence leading up to it are a new beginning, an opening that
propels the 8-year-old Vesta, her mother Eula and younger brother
LaRue to the loving and colorful home of Ruby and Polaris Staples.
There Eula finds a peaceful place in the basement in which to recede
and muse on the nature of her love for Ontario Smalls, a love whose
most visible remnant is a serpentine facial scar, which her rescuer
and friend Ruby calls ``angry healing flesh.''
</P>
<P>
It is there that Vesta and LaRue find a sister in the Staples'
daughter Ouida, an imaginative, confident child, and a ready-made
mother in Ruby. And while Ruby's stories, told in stoop-sitting
sessions with the neighbors, are too uncontrolled for the rigid vigil
Vesta must keep over her life and emotions, young LaRue is drawn to
this other mother, absorbing stories while sitting in a rocker in
Ruby's kitchen. These stories ignite his imagination, allowing him to
create his own make-believe character, Miss Snake, ``who got in and
out of fixes each time she appeared, who started out with purple spots
but changed each time she shed her skin.''
</P>
<P>
The creation of the Miss Snake stories, as well as the later tales
of Tennessee Coal Iron Company Jones, are author Lee's masterstroke,
completely rooted in the African American oral traditions of Bre'er
Rabbit and Anansi the spider. The stories, themselves deserving of
their own book, act here to illuminate the narrative and give it a
lyrical magic that both captivate and enlighten the characters. In
young LaRue's mouth, the stories also represent a connectedness to
African American culture and identity; they delight Ruby and Ouida,
but dismay Vesta and Eula, who consider them ``lies.'' For Eula and
Vesta, the stories threaten to initiate an internal battle with
secrets and dreams, long hidden but recurring as closed-off spaces
that keep them from knowing peace. And until they understand the gift
the Miss Snake stories have to offer, that peace remains elusive, just
beyond their reach.
</P>
<P>
Lee has written in the siblings LaRue, Vesta, Ouida and December
(who appear near the end of Part I) a quartet of unforgettable
characters whose personalities run counter to expectation. LaRue is a
sensitive, intuitive man with a spirit that cannot be crushed; a man
who, when recognizing his love for Olive Winters, fights against his
impulse to pull away; a man who marks the changes in his world from
after the Great War through the 1960s with wonder, a great love for
his people and a moving grace. His sister, Vesta, is rigid and
frightened, a woman whose retreat from the pain of early
disappointments drains the vitality from her life. Ouida supposedly
has everything to be desired among black folk of the time -- fair skin,
vivacious wit, imagination -- yet she makes a radical decision to
embrace an unconventional love. Then there is December, Ruby and
Polaris' daughter, whose arrival at the winter equinox signals birth
out of death, but who, under Vesta's excruciatingly restrictive love,
becomes a colorless cipher of a Detroit housewife, more concerned with
the correctness of her peanut butter selection than the quality of her
life.
</P>
<P>
Lee's novel also displays an adept use of color, light and space as
indicators of vitality, of memory, of love and loss. Images appear in
unexpected ways: The skin of an orange that stimulates the elderly
Vesta's memories; her youthful retreat from the tumult of color into a
seemingly serene world represented by an all-white wardrobe and
meticulously cross-stitched homilies; the cobalt blue lovemaking of
LaRue and Olive. While there are moments in which I wished Lee's style
were a little more restrained, or conversely displayed more emotion,
these are small quibbles about a book that is so richly imagined.
</P>
<P>
LaRue Smalls finishes many stories in ``The Serpent's Gift'' with,
``I've told my friends, now you tell yours.'' The phrase is most
apropos in celebrating the arrival of Helen Elaine Lee and ``The
Serpent's Gift,'' a book whose colors will linger behind the eyes long
after you read the final page.

 From June Through Early October, Winnipeg Can Be a Delight 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Through the years, my job as a sports reporter has taken me to a
lot of interesting places -- New Orleans for the Sugar Bowl, Quebec and
Montreal for hockey games, San Francisco for a Super Bowl, even to
London for Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
Most of the time, my friends willingly suggest they slip into my
suitcase or come along as a photographer. But when the Washington
Capitals of the National Hockey League opened their season in
Winnipeg, Manitoba, last fall, no one offered to join me.
</P>
<P>
``Good luck,'' said one. ``Stay warm.''
</P>
<P>
``Winnipeg?'' said another. ``Isn't that in the middle of
nowhere?''
</P>
<P>
A call to the NHL's Winnipeg Jets public relations office made me
wonder.
</P>
<P>
``Winnipeg is like nowhere you've ever been before,'' promised
information director Mike O'Hearn.
</P>
<P>
Mike Ridley, a native of Winnipeg who plays center for the
Capitals, said, ``I've given up trying to explain where it is. When
people ask where I'm from, I just say North Minneapolis.''
</P>
<P>
Winnipeg sits just about in the middle of Canada, just about in the
middle of North America. To outsiders, if Winnipeg is known at all, it
is known primarily for frigid weather.
</P>
<P>
The city claims the intersection of Portage and Main streets as the
coldest street corner in North America. Temperatures dip to minus-30
degrees Fahrenheit regularly, as the wind rips in unabated from the
central Canadian plains.
</P>
<P>
``Block heaters (to keep engines from freezing) are regular
equipment sold on cars in Winnipeg,'' said Ridley. ``I spent the first
22 years of my life in Winnipeg,'' he added. ``I thought cars
everywhere came with block heaters; when I went to buy my first car in
New York, I wanted to make sure it came standard and was told it was
extra. The guy finally told me I didn't really need one.''
</P>
<P>
Wondering why you would ever want to go to Winnipeg? Obviously, you
think, there are reasons Winnipeg is not included in the same sentence
with Quebec, Montreal and Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
But that's in the winter.
</P>
<P>
In the spring and summer, this city of 650,000 blossoms. From June
through early October, Winnipeg can be a delight.
</P>
<P>
``Winnipeg is a wonderful place in the summer,'' said Ridley, who
still takes his family home for vacation during hockey's off-season.
``There is always something to do, places to go. Everything from
fishing and golf to museums, dinning out and gambling in the
casinos.''
</P>
<P>
In summer, Winnipeg residents and their visitors enjoy temperatures
in the mid-70s to mid-80s -- with zero humidity.
</P>
<P>
It is true that unless you come from the North Pole or the Outback,
you are probably not going to confuse Winnipeg with Paris -- or
Montreal.
</P>
<P>
But there are wide streets, warm sunny benches and some very good
cappuccino to be enjoyed down at the Forks, where the Red and
Assiniboine rivers meet.
</P>
<P>
Winnipeg residents are friendly. One day, while trying to make my
way to the Forks, I stopped in a small card shop in the restored Union
Station Market at Main and Broadway to ask directions. The shopkeeper
smiled, came out from behind his counter and personally led me to the
site, leaving his store unattended.
</P>
<P>
``It is not very far, but from this side it can be a little
tricky,'' he said of the short walk. ``I'll take you there.''
</P>
<P>
And once you get to the Forks, you will have reached a historic
crossroads that dates back 6,000 years, to a time when historians say
aboriginal groups met to trade and socialize.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Winnipeg is an Indian name for ``Where muddy waters
meet.'' And people are still meeting there, for lunch and shopping and
an afternoon of sunshine in the 57-acre enclave, which includes a
six-story, glass-enclosed tower for exhibits, a skating rink, an
amphitheater and other outdoor amusements.
</P>
<P>
Through the centuries, Cree and Assiniboine Indians, fur traders
and European settlers came and went as the spot grew, first as a place
for fur trading in the 1730s, when people came in canoes, York boats
and steamboats; then as a settlement for Scottish farmers in 1812 and
a hub for train cargo and passengers in the 1880s; until today, when
two antique horse barns have been converted into an airy marketplace.
</P>
<P>
Beyond the shopping and dining areas, there is a rock wall carved
with scenes depicting Winnipeg's history that winds down to a
beautiful and peaceful paved walkway along the riverbank.
</P>
<P>
From there, it is an easy walk along the Assiniboine River to the
stunning Manitoba Legislative Building, built in neoclassical style in
1919 and topped with a 13½-foot, 5-ton statue called the Golden Boy,
holding a torch meant to ``light the way'' to progress.
</P>
<P>
The Tourist Information Center is also located next door.
</P>
<P>
The city's streets are wide and clean, and, like a European city,
it is made for walking, whether along the river banks or elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Traffic jams don't exist.
</P>
<P>
``Rush hour,'' said O'Hearn, the Jets' public relations man, ``is
three cars at a stop light.''
</P>
<P>
Crime (no surprise after the shop keeper's actions) is also rare.
</P>
<P>
And when you get tired of being above ground, or if you're there on
a rainy day -- or snowy one in winter -- there is a whole different city
of shops and walkways underground.
</P>
<P>
Winnipeg is made up of culturally diverse neighborhoods, good
restaurants, fine museums and a lively regional theater.
</P>
<P>
The Winnipeg Art Gallery has one of the best collections of Inuit
art in the world; the Exchange District, once the center of Winnipeg's
wholesale and manufacturing district, has had its wonderful old
buildings restored and converted to fine stores and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
Academy Road, one of the city's oldest areas, is the place to go
for designer clothes, cozy restaurants and specialty shops. Osborne
Village is a five-block area filled with shops that feature local
artisans, imported chocolate and books.
</P>
<P>
``Little Italy,'' between Pembina Highway and Stafford Avenue on
Corydon Avenue, offers sidewalk cafes; and Saint Boniface is home to
the largest French-speaking community in western Canada.
</P>
<P>
At night, the Grey Nuns' Walkway (Promenade Tache) becomes a
lamp-lighted path between Tache Avenue and the Red River and provides
a pretty view of Winnipeg and the Forks.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Among the most diverting places to visit is the Museum of Man and
Nature, an interpretive museum with life-like reconstructions of
Indians hunting buffalo and planetarium for the star-gazers among us.
</P>
<P>
One of the more interesting replicas is of the Nonsuch, a
two-masted sailing vessel called a ketch. The ship arrived in 1668 and
was the first European ship to sail into Hudson Bay.
</P>
<P>
It sailed out again to England with a cargo of furs, and it was
that incident that eventually led to the founding of the Hudson's Bay
Co., the trading company that still exists and is most familiar in the
form of its department stores.
</P>
<P>
Last March, that same company donated its entire historic archives
collection to the museum, which will house it in a new $2.2 million
wing to be completed next year. The collection, which is said to be
among the most extensive and detailed private historical resources
ever maintained, portrays more than three centuries of the company's
history, including the quest for the North West Passage -- the water
route from the Atlantic to the Pacific that took explorers 400 years
to get right.

 TRAVEL NOTES: London Larks 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the big doings in London this summer is the 100th
anniversary of the Tower Bridge, marked officially on June 30 with
fanfare and fireworks on the banks of the River Thames.
</P>
<P>
Created for the centenary, ``The Celebration Story'' exhibit in
rooms and passages inside the bridge recounts the story of this
Victorian engineering marvel and city life 100 years ago; for info,
call (800) 781-6088.
</P>
<P>
Nearby, at the Tower of London, dating to at least 1066, the
Historic Royal Palaces Agency says it won't be refilling the big moat
this year. The moat's been dry for about 150 years, when it was
declared a health hazard and drained. Although there's a new cafe
opening on the wharf outside the tower, the new $10 million jewel
house for the royal baubles that opened in March is still the big
draw. For tower info, call (011) (44) (71) 709-0765.
</P>
<P>
The Queen's digs at Buckingham Palace will again be open to the
public from Aug. 7 to Oct. 2. London's Stafford hotel is offering a
special pass for its guests that'll take them to the head of the daily
ticket queue; (800) 525-4800.

GLOBAL WHEELER: Although she's been in a wheelchair since she was
2, Annie Mackin is an intrepid traveler who's logged four trips to
Europe since 1978. During her five weeks there last summer, the
40-year-old woman decided to write a guide for other disabled
travelers, ``Wheelchair through Europe.''
</P>
<P>
Many hotels that are accessible to the disabled are
top-of-the-line, Mackin says, so she wrote her book with a budget in
mind, seeking out accessible lodging from $90 to $110 a night, double.
Although she traveled with an attendant, Mackin found many places
accessible to those with good upper body strength.
</P>
<P>
Some tips: Take the narrowest wheelchair you can find and jell cell
batteries that won't tip over and spill, and remind the airlines to
pack the chair carefully. Also, try to fly into London or Amsterdam
where there's accessible mass transit from the airport to the city so
you won't have to pay for a cab.
</P>
<P>
European travel, she says ``can be difficult, can be challenging,
but it's not impossible. You miss a lot if you stay home.'' Send check
or money order for $12.95 to Graphic Language Press, P.O. Box 270,

 EDER ON BOOKS: The Law of the Land 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richard Dooling is a traveler in two drastically different
territories: the law he practices today in Nebraska, and the folkways
of the Mende people in the backlands of Sierra Leone, where he once
stayed.
</P>
<P>
In his sardonic and decidedly untidy novel, ``White Man's Grave''
(Farrar, Straus Giroux, $22, 386 pp.), he pits the tribal magic of
each against the other. There is no question who wins. Dooling has
something of the beady, comical glitter of Evelyn Waugh -- though not
his formal perfection -- but only in one eye. Waugh traveled in Sierra
Leone and wrote nastily about both whites and blacks. Dooling's parody
wickedly impales his Americans; his ingenious sympathies lie with the
Mende villagers, giving his book an aspect beyond parody.
</P>
<P>
The story goes roughly like this: Randall Killigan, a maniacally
hard-charging lawyer in Indianapolis, has a straying son, Michael, who
went to Africa with the Peace Corps for two years, stayed for four and
has disappeared. While Randall fulminates, mobilizes his senator and
the State Department and offers large rewards, a second effort goes
on. Boone, an artist friend of Michael's and a fugitive from an
equivalent bull elephant of a father, treks into the Sierra Leone
bush. Eventually Michael turns up along with an explanation for his
disappearance.
</P>
<P>
Most of the African part of the story, which is most of the book,
concerns Boone's painful and illuminating encounters with a primitive
village civilization. Painful for him, illuminating for us. The young
man's artistic veneer quickly burns off, disclosing a hereditary,
stiff-necked American prig. The priggishness, though, allows the
author to show us what Boone refuses to see: how supremely and
winningly, in the notion of primitive civilization, the noun
demolishes the adjective.
</P>
<P>
Dooling gives us a bravura display of satire with Randall Killigan,
in war paint and tribal regalia, as a legal chieftain whose ambition
is to be ``the synonym for bankruptcy in the Seventh Circuit.'' He
demolishes the lawyers for bankrupt firms. He lays the reeking
carcasses of his victims upon his conference-room table, apportioning
bits to the rival creditors' lawyers. He is the most virile tiger in
the jungle: the electronic notebook he carries into negotiating battle
has twice as many bytes as anyone else's. It contains for instant
reference the entire Federal Bankruptcy Code, annotated.
</P>
<P>
The imagery, of course, is purposeful as well as comic. As the
search for his son goes on, with Boone encountering witches,
shape-changers, juju medicine, the dumbstruck regard of young
villagers and the cryptic though essentially benevolent maneuvering of
the elders, Africa leaks into Indianapolis. Randall mysteriously
receives a hideous, skin-wrapped package that drips blood; now and
then it turns into a bat. For a while he wonders if he has a brain
tumor; gradually he realizes that it is witchcraft.
</P>
<P>
It will turn out to be self-inflicted: he, we will learn by the
end, is possessed by a witch-spirit and has, in effect, become one. As
one character points out, the American counterpart of voodoo is
lawsuits: Both are used to kill, sicken or otherwise ruin one's
neighbors. The Mende hire witches, we hire lawyers. Dooling brings off
his satiric parallel, which might otherwise seem forced, with a wit
and outrageousness that make it work.
</P>
<P>
His success has large holes in it, though. He can satirize his
countrymen but he is plain awful when he attempts anything more inward
with them. When Randall goes to Mass and confession to try to stave
off the witchery, his mental flailing is written in flamboyant cliche
and interlarded with more cliche: lengthy quotations from the liturgy.
Satire has sunk out of its depth to become the mawkish thing it
satirizes.
</P>
<P>
In the African chapters, the author's sympathy and responsiveness
produce writing whose humor is carried on a current of discovery and
astonishment. Only the Americans are flat. Michael, when discovered,
is simply an American overachiever gone native. Boone's cultural
obtuseness has a narrative usefulness -- it allows the delicate
complexities of the villagers to emerge more clearly -- but it turns
him into a null character. An anthropologist who has lived with the
Mende for years and has, in effect, become one of them, is
considerably less interesting than what he has to say. He is a good
explainer but not much else. Oddly, the only American with any
roundness or allure is a thoroughly reprehensible Peace Corps veteran,
infinitely cynical about the villagers and mainly in it for the
adventure and the beer.
</P>
<P>
He is alive, though, and authentic. And it is in evoking the life
of Africa and in suggesting the wisdom and forbearance that underlie
the ``superstitions'' of the Mende villagers that Dooling is at his
best. There is, first of all, a vivid presentation not just of what
his Africa looks, feels and smells like but of the emotions of unease
and beguilement they can produce. The vast landscape seen from the
descending airplane looks like ``an empire of solid broccoli tops
stretching inland to the horizon.'' Boone rides a rickety truck into
the interior; people, animals and cargo are so jammed together that
the passengers practice a kind of metabolism-lowering trance state.
</P>
<P>
The villagers live in a fearful world of uncontrollable events:
hunger, disease, the depredations of white settlers and diamond
seekers, and the arbitrary incursions of warring political factions
whose maneuvering in the capital is felt 200 miles down-country.
Dooling portrays the rich culture that can evolve from powerlessness
to command one's environment; as opposed to Western culture, which has
evolved from just the opposite. From command, that is, or a sense of
command or -- look at our cities -- an illusion of command.
</P>
<P>
The suggestion is there without being explicit. It is fleshed out
in countless scenes in which Dooling gives life to a village that
manages dignity and a subversive humor in the teeth of what seem to us
like invincible odds. The witchcraft, the magical secret societies,
the shamanism, the taboos are ways of coping with unmanageable dangers
both outside and within. In his portraits -- a visiting witch cleaner
who runs a cotton thread around the village so nobody shall leave or
enter until the place is cleaned; the poignantly striving third wife
of a local political thug; and above all, the elder who adopts Boone
as his son so that the villagers can see him as a real person, albeit
an odd and misbehaving one -- Dooling evokes the humane checks and
balances of a deep world; the logic, you might say, of its magic.

 Goodbye to Human Rights? (Washn) 
 Dionne is a member of The Washington Post editorial-page staff.
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fight for a tougher human-rights policy toward
China was lost long before President Clinton announced surrender last
week. Clinton's decision to throw aside his own campaign commitments
on the issue bodes very badly for the future of human rights as a core
concept of American foreign policy. From now on, it seems, the United
States' human-rights policy will amount to talk, talk and more talk.
</P>
<P>
The battle to impose trade sanctions on China's dictators was lost,
first, within and by the Clinton administration itself. Because of a
lack of internal discipline, the administration couldn't even manage a
coherent effort to bluff the Chinese leadership into making at least
some serious human rights concessions.
</P>
<P>
Even administration officials concede that while some in the State
Department were trying to tell China's leaders that the United States
was prepared to be tough, the Treasury, Commerce and Agriculture
departments of the same administration-as well as many who occupy the
economy policy precincts of Clinton's own White House-were sending the
Chinese clear signals that said: Never mind. Ignore the State
Department's claptrap. There's no way we'll impose serious sanctions.
The Chinese sat tight waited for the inevitable cave-in and the
renewal of most favored nation trade status.
</P>
<P>
That cave-in was made all the more inevitable by the behavior of
the American business community. Business leaders are, of course, free
to lobby for whatever policy they want. In the United States, you
don't face torture or prison for opposing government policy, as you do
in China. But if we're counting on American business to be the
conveyor belt of human rights to China, we may be waiting a very long
time. Every signal the business community sent to the Chinese
government was that money and trade mattered a lot more than the
rights of political dissidents rotting in jail cells. Why ruffle the
feathers of the very people you'll be doing deals with?
</P>
<P>
``The business community was shameful in the way they conducted
themselves,'' said Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., a leading
congressional advocate of human rights in China. ``They told the
Chinese government, ``you hang tough, they won't revoke MFN.' They
associated themselves with the regime, and that was shameful.''
</P>
<P>
It can be argued, as Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen did, that
unilateral trade sanctions were the least practical way to advance the
cause of human rights. Unilateral sanctions, he said, were more likely
to hurt us than the Chinese, since other countries would pick up the
contracts the United States walked away from. But if ever there were a
practical time for sanctions, it is now, when the U.S.-Chinese trade
balance is heavily in China's favor.
</P>
<P>
Some serious human-rights advocates also opposed sanctions on the
ground that increased trade and prosperity would inevitably make China
a freer society. ``Not only does such trade help produce a middle
class, with increasingly sophisticated political and social views,''
said James Finn of Freedom House, writing recently in Commonweal
magazine, ``but it introduces new information and values into an
insular society.''
</P>
<P>
Maybe so, but the relationship between markets and freedom is far
from automatic. China's markets, after all, are not really ``free,''
given the large role played by the political and military leadership
in determing who will get rich. And as George Black of the Lawyers
Committee for Human Rights argued in the Los Angeles Times, China may
be developing a system that he called ``market Stalinism.'' The
government will let markets develop as long as there is no challenge
to its political authority. It's quite possible to say yes to Ronald
McDonald and no to the Statue of Liberty-and to make that decision
stick for a long time.
</P>
<P>
But even assuming that Bentsen and Finn are right, Clinton had a
problem in renewing MFN that George Bush did not. Bush actually
believed sanctions were a mistake. Clinton, on the other hand, accused
Bush of having ``coddled the regime, pleading for progress but failing
to impose penalties for intransigence.''
</P>
<P>
The people of China, Clinton said in 1992, ``are still denied their
basic rights and liberties. They are denied the right to choose their
own leaders; they are still imprisoned for simply calling for
democracy; they continue to suffer torture and cruel, inhuman and
degrading treatment and punishment.'' And on and on and on.
</P>
<P>
All those conditions still apply. Yet Clinton, after so many
threats and promises, was forced to back down. In doing so, he sent a
message about all future American statements and undertakings about
human rights: We may not really mean them. Forced to confront a
contradiction between his stated commitment to human rights and his
promise to put economics at the center of American foreign policy,
Clinton chose economics. It is not an irrational choice. But its
implications will not be lost on China's dictators, or on dictators
anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
What's most troubling is not Clinton's flip-flop but the fact that
it appeared so inevitable. Human rights served America's interests in
the Cold War as a rallying cry against Soviet power. But now that the
Cold War is over, a lot of policy makers are starting to see concerns
over human rights as a barrier to a rational, self-interested American
foreign policy. In the case of China, after all, there were not only
concerns over trade but also over cooperation against North Korea.
</P>
<P>
If human rights are destined to give way to cold-eyed realism
whenever the going gets even remotely tough, then let's be honest
about it. Let's stop rationalizing by pretending that what we really
cared about in this MFN business was ``opening up'' China to
democracy. If we're unprepared to come to the defense of the lives and
liberties of others when doing so might inconvenience our own pursuit
of happiness, we should at least admit it to ourselves.

 Females Better Off Keeping Males Out of Their Genes, Biologist Urges 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It ranks up there with the world's other great unanswerable
questions: Will Madonna's career ever get back on track? Are Roseanne
and Tom going to reunite? When will Susan Lucci ever get her Emmy?
</P>
<P>
And now we have: ``Why bother with sex?''
</P>
<P>
OK, we guys know why.
</P>
<P>
But Rosemary Redfield, a Canadian evolutionary biologist, wants the
female of the species to know that when their hormones are in
hysterics, when their libido is wired, when they've got ``making
whoopee'' on their brain cells, they should think twice about having
sex.
</P>
<P>
Redfield, a researcher in the Department of Zoology at the
University of British Columbia in Vancouver, wrote in the journal
Nature that a female would be more likely to have genetically
healthier offspring by not mixing her genes with those of a male,
whose sperm is more likely to carry mutations than are her eggs.
</P>
<P>
She was talking about hypothetical, computer-modeled species -- 
lonely, dateless amoeba, to you and me. But because there were no
single-cell spokes-creatures available to comment, we had to interview
humans.
</P>
<P>
``This is male-bashing at the molecular and biological level,''
Dennis Palumbo, a psychotherapist in private practice in Los Angeles,
said of Redfield's findings.
</P>
<P>
Redfield, who was unavailable for comment, told the Washington Post
that her ideas on sexual reproduction ``do not apply to the vast
majority of human males, who make many very important non-genetic
contributions to their offspring.''
</P>
<P>
Still, Palumbo asked: ``Are we, as men, basically on the way out?
It sounds like that.
</P>
<P>
``But on the other hand, male scientists have sort of been the
voices of record for so many years that some part of me now thinks
that this is an attempt by female researchers to balance the voices
out there.''
</P>
<P>
Helen E. Fisher, research associate in the department of
anthropology at the American Museum of Natural History in New York and
the author of ``Anatomy of Love'' (Ballantine, 1992), said the study
by Redfield ``is providing balance to the subject and pointing out
that there are some maladaptive consequences to sex as well.''
</P>
<P>
``It's more adaptive to clone yourself than it is to reproduce with
a male partner who may introduce mutations and produce a more shoddy
offspring,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
Too bad people can't be more like strawberries, Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
``Strawberries clone themselves when they are in the middle of a
nice good patch. But when they get to the edge of the patch and they
have to branch out into dangerous frontier, they reproduce sexually
instead.
</P>
<P>
``And that is useful to them because they've got mutant and new
kinds of strawberries that may survive in very unpredictable
circumstances,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
``The same could be said of human beings. It has long been said
that there is variety in offspring.''
</P>
<P>
As far back as Darwin, scientists have argued that reproduction is
possible through parthenogenesis, or virgin birth. Ellen Kriedman says
Darwin be damned.
</P>
<P>
The author of ``How Can We Light a Fire When the Kids Are Driving
Us Crazy: A Guide for Parents to Be Lovers'' (Villard, 1994) said any
woman who has ever had an orgasm wouldn't want to put the kibosh on
sex.
</P>
<P>
``There's nothing like it. It's the closet act you can engage in.
It's intimacy. It's loving. It fulfills your need to be held and to be
touched and to be connected with another human being,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
``Aside from the biological, it is psychologically and emotionally
satisfying to be engaged in the sexual act.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional Add End)
</P>
<P>
Palumbo said he doesn't like the notion of eliminating the
``middleman'' -- or the sexual act -- from procreation.
</P>
<P>
``There's already a growing body of literature delegitimizing the
need for males. Our culture already suffers from the lack of fathers,
a crucial aspect of the dysfunction in families. I know if I were a
woman, I would be frustrated by how many men abrogate their
responsibility as fathers.''
</P>
<P>
Maybe, Palumbo said, Redfield's work ``will be a clarion call for
men to hang around,'' even though the biologist ``was studying amoeba
who missed out on intimate dinner dates, going to the movies and
holding hands.''
</P>
<P>
Christine Martin, a former erotic film actress and exotic dancer,
said Redfield's sexual reproduction theory reeks of ``female
supremacy.'' Martin, who resides in New York, teaches a class in ``How
to Drive Your Woman Wild in Bed'' at the Learning Annex in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
``Men have been battered by feminists and are confused by courtship
and how to please women,'' she said, adding that Redfield's
conclusions ``are anti-male to me. And the fact that it is anti-sex is
pretty anti-human because sex is not only for reproduction, it is for
pleasure, relaxation and intimacy.''

segments of the documentary follow the lives of four generations of
women in one family. Teresa Wright, Olympia Dukakis, Talia Shire,
Justine Bateman and Brooke Smith play the women who gather to
celebrate the birth of Bateman's daughter.
</P>
<P>
Madge Sinclair and Jasmine Guy play mother and daughter African
American friends who join in the celebration. Throughout the course of
the gathering, they discuss the changes women have seen and fought for
over the course of the century.
</P>
<P>
``To me it just showed that everything starts with the family,''
Sinclair says of the fictional scene. ``You can find every single
instance of anything that happens in your life within the family. It
only is multiplied to that many powers when it goes out in the
community. Everything that happens in the community happens to the
family.''
</P>
<P>
Originally, Sinclair worried that her and Guy's characters were
included to fill a quota. But then she realized their inclusion made
perfect sense. ``If we are talking about the journey of women, this is
about where we have arrived at from a place where black women and
white women could barely talk to each other in public, except if one
was giving orders and the other was saying, `Yes ma'am.'
</P>
<P>
``To have a family as closely knit as that one was to feel
comfortable enough with these two women to invite them to a happening,
I thought it was pretty nice and indicative to where I think we have
arrived, which is a happy place.''
</P>
<P>
The weeklong shoot brought all the actresses closer together. ``I
came out with such enormous respect for all of those women,'' Shire
says. ``It was hard to say goodby.''
</P>
<P>
Guy recalls how much they talked about about their lives and
careers when the cameras weren't rolling. ``For me, Justine and Brooke
Smith, to get a perspective from Olympia and Talia, I think, was
really invaluable. At least where I am, I'm still trying to plot
everything out and pursue specific goals. I think Olympia said to me
one day, `You can't plan this career. Your career just is.' It was a
relief to know that because you are kind of fighting a losing battle
thinking we are in control of this business.''
</P>
<P>
Bateman believes the documentary is important for women her age.
``I'm 28 and I need to see this stuff,'' she says. ``I came into a
world where I already had the vote. I already had equality -- the most
equality we've had. And to see that this was hard won, I can be really
grateful for where I am now.''

 History Re-Riveted on `A Century of Women' 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tina Hill is always asked the same question: Did she know she was
making history when she became a ``Rosie the Riveter'' during World
War II?
</P>
<P>
Yes and no.
</P>
<P>
``I knew I was making history for myself, but I didn't know I was
making history for anyone else. Always as a little child, there were
two or three things I always wanted in my house. I didn't want a leaky
roof and I didn't want a lot of fussing and fighting. Up until now, I
have had some leaks, but I've had no fighting!''
</P>
<P>
Hill, now 76 and living in Los Angeles, is among the women profiled
on the first installment of TBS' six-hour ``A Century of Women.'' The
Texas native migrated to Los Angeles in 1940 to seek a better life.
She found unheard-of economic freedom for a black woman when she began
working in one of the many defense-industry facilities sprouting in
Southern California during World War II. After the men returned from
the war, she continued working at the plant, run by North American
Aviation (now known as Rockwell). She retired in 1980, after 37 years.
</P>
<P>
``They didn't have a lot of jobs for black people then, especially
women,'' Hill says. ``Some of them had jobs working in the hotels.
They had a few black teachers.''
</P>
<P>
When Hill came to Los Angeles to stay with an aunt, all she could
find was domestic work. Then came the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.
``I went home and married my childhood sweetheart. He went into the
service and I came back to Los Angeles again. They were hiring people,
so I went to the plant and put in my application that day.
</P>
<P>
She applied at North American Aviation. ``They hired me and they
sent me to a training school for six weeks. They paid you the same
thing as if you were working regular. That old 40 cents an hour was a
lot of money. I would bring home about $16 a week.'' As a domestic,
she earned $40 a month.
</P>
<P>
She was happy working at the plant, she recalls, ``as long as I was
making some money that was sufficient and I was able to spend it as I
wanted to. I was home with my family when night came. That's what I
liked.''
</P>
<P>
World War II, she says, ``helped every woman who was breathing air
because they learned to manage things and do things. We just learned a
lot. We learned how to do things we thought we couldn't do.''
</P>
<P>
If there was racism at the plant, Hill says, ``you couldn't show
it. Roosevelt was a good president and he opened up the doors and
things for us to go in these different places to work.'' Whites, she
says, ``didn't want us to get ahead. They wanted us to stay back.
Hitler got the black woman out of the white woman's kitchen.''

 Jay Craven, Director of Film `Where the Rivers Flow North'' 
 (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is one of those rare spring days when Washington
city is at its most beautiful, and Vermont filmmaker Jay Craven is
nostalgic.
</P>
<P>
``I used to live here,'' he says, taking in the sights of
Georgetown as he ambles toward the Potomac River -- ``1970 to '71.''
</P>
<P>
College? you wonder. Government family? Military brat?
</P>
<P>
Nope.
</P>
<P>
``I was a full-time anti-war activist,'' says Craven.
</P>
<P>
It was no small time in his life -- and not only for the obvious
reasons. Raised by his grandparents, Craven grew up more or less alone
and had always longed for a place where he felt at home, a community.
He discovered both in the anti-Vietnam War movement, as well as
something equally valuable: his ability to organize and make things
happen.
</P>
<P>
These days he is still leading a charge -- and still extolling the
virtues of community. But now his venue is a feature film, ``Where the
Rivers Flow North,'' a made-in-Vermont opus funded mostly by
Vermonters, set against a singular time and place in the state's
history.
</P>
<P>
Craven, 42, and his co-producers are distributing the movie too.
Encouraged by the buzz at the recent Sundance Film Festival, which
gave it two extra screenings, the team turned down eight distribution
offers that seemed too limited.
</P>
<P>
``We want to see it play across the country,'' Craven says, ``at
least in every town in New England and New York with a movie
theater.''
</P>
<P>
The film has opened cautiously to appreciative reviews, first in
Vermont, New Hampshire and Upstate New York, then two art houses in
Boston. Since then it's been getting released gradually elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Taken from a novella by Vermonter Howard Frank Mosher, and a
screenplay by Craven and Don Bredes, the movie tells the story of an
old Vermont logger and his Native American housekeeper-companion and
their battle in 1927 to survive the construction of a big
hydro-electric dam that threatens to flood their land.
</P>
<P>
The logger, Noel Lord (Rip Torn), is defiant -- no amount of money
will buy his lifetime lease and livelihood. His companion, Bangor
(Native American actress Tantoo Cardinal), is more pragmatic.
</P>
<P>
Craven, who also directed, has lived almost 20 years in the poor,
rural country where much of ``Rivers'' was filmed. He moved there
after his Washington sojourn and a couple of years in New York.
</P>
<P>
``I wanted to be in a place where there was a stronger sense of
community,'' he says of his decision to leave New York. ``And I was
interested in the challenge of mingling with people unlike myself.''
</P>
<P>
So just around the time of the Saturday Night Massacre (Craven
still chronicles that period in political terms), he set out with a
girlfriend to visit a poet friend in Vermont and stayed.
</P>
<P>
After a lonely first year spent researching Vermont history and
nursing an arm he'd broken carrying wood, Craven, an activist by
nature, started the Catamount Arts Center.
</P>
<P>
Using it as a base, he put together a 16mm series of American and
European film classics, which he showed in church basements and town
halls around the state. He also taught history, journalism and
film-making at an alternative high school and fathered a son.
</P>
<P>
By the time he set out to make ``Rivers,'' he had more than a
decade of community activity and personal contacts behind him. He also
had a couple of documentaries and a 30-minute fiction film to his
credit; both were helpful when he reached out for funding to his
friends and neighbors, some of them conservative Yankee Republicans he
never dreamed he'd be buddies with in his anti-war days.
</P>
<P>
Craven, his producer and wife Bess O'Brien and associate producer
Lauren Moye (both of whom were pregnant) systematically worked the
state. They brought cocktails and homemade hors d'oeuvres, a chance to
be part of a major motion picture and a fund-raising style borrowed
from charitable giving.
</P>
<P>
Individuals and businesses from all over the state, and some from
neighboring New Hampshire, participated. Even the ads that paid for
the publicity brochure were local: Bailey's Country Store, the Rotary
Club of St. Johnsbury, the National Life of Vermont insurance company.
</P>
<P>
Grants from 11 foundations (including the National Endowment for
the Arts), $475,000 in business loans and a $500,000 foreign-sales
advance completed the almost $2 million budget. Finally, during the
cold, wind-swept fall of 1992, the movie was shot.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half the cast and crew are or have been residents of Vermont
(or New Hampshire) -- including Michael J. Fox and Treat Williams, who
have small character roles in the film. More than 100 local extras,
including Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, participated too.
</P>
<P>
The production team operated out of Craven's and O'Brien's home, an
1821 farmhouse in Barnet, a town of about 2,000.
</P>
<P>
The ups and downs of Craven's personal life have made him
particularly interested in the relationship between the two main
characters in ``Rivers.'' He empathizes with them both, but
particularly with the logger.
</P>
<P>
``Noel is a tough guy with vulnerability he can't fully face,'' he
says. ``He taunts the gods and has to do things his way. He takes on
lost causes and difficult jobs that would be simpler to do another
way. I can identify with that.''

 4 `City-States' Drive Europe's Economy (Lyon) 
 Drozdiak is a Washington Post correspondent based in Paris. 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LYON, France
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A resurrection of ``city-states'' and regions is
quietly transforming Europe's political and economic landscape,
diminishing the influence of national governments and redrawing the
continental map of power for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
As the revolution wrought by information highways, rapid means of
travel and global capital flow gathers momentum, the traditional
dominance of capitals such as Paris, Rome and London is being
challenged by provinces whose location and infrastructure seem better
adapted to the continent's modern demands.
</P>
<P>
With remarkable speed, the areas surrounding Lyon, Milan, Stuttgart
and Barcelona have emerged as the ``four motors'' driving the process
of European integration. Since signing a co-operation pact in 1988,
the four partners have parlayed their skilled industrial work forces
and affluent markets into a dynamic partnership that transcends
national loyalties.
</P>
<P>
These poles of prosperity are sucking in huge investments and
making new demands for greater autonomy. Some experts believe the
emerging urban economies are creating a new historical dynamism that
will ultimately transform the political structure of Europe by
creating a new kind of ``Hanseatic League'' that consists of thriving
city-states. (The Hanseatic League was an alliance of northern port
cities in Europe whose commercial success enabled them to become
sovereign entities in the 15th and 16th centuries.).
</P>
<P>
-- Stuttgart, the capital of Baden-Wurttemburg, one of Germany's
wealthiest regions, already enjoys enormous autonomy in the country's
decentralized political system and has started to seek partners abroad
as it develops its own ``foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
-- Milan, the capital of Italy's Lombardy that has long served as the
country's industrial base, is the home of the Northern League led by
populist Umberto Bossi.
</P>
<P>
Capitalizing on voter dismay with the massive corruption scandals
and tax money lavished on ``white-elephant'' projects in the poorer
south, Bossi has built solid support in Milan for his call to break
Italy into three autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
-- Barcelona, the capital of the Catalonia region, has long enjoyed
substantial political autonomy in Spain and now wants the power to
raise and keep its own share of income tax away from Madrid. The city
turned north to build a bustling economic triangle with Toulouse and
Montpelier in France that sees itself as the crossroads of the
Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
-- Lyon, France's second city, is developing into one of Europe's
faster-growing regions by building connections with Geneva and Turin.
Lyon now does twice as much business with northern Italy as with
Paris. The trend is expected to accelerate when a new high-speed train
tunnel bored through the Alps cuts the travel time between Lyon and
Turin to 70 minutes.
</P>
<P>
While talk of political autonomy from Paris is muted compared to
its other regional partners, Lyon is slowly asserting its own
independence as the capital of the Rhone-Alps region. It now operates
nine offices abroad, as far away as Toronto and Shanghai, to carve out
its own foreign commercial policy.
</P>
<P>
``In a way, Europe is returning to its roots by building again on
the regions,'' says Jean Chemain, director of Lyon's Chamber of
Commerce. ``The Romans settled here because access to the rivers and
roads made it a natural base for their empire. Business is doing it
for the same reasons, and those enterprises are the key building
blocks of Europe, not national governments.''
</P>
<P>
The process was hastened by the announcement of the European Union
that it would tear down national barriers by the end of 1992. Instead
of worrying about tedious delays and dozens of customs documents at
frontiers, companies realized they could finally concentrate on
locating production and distribution centers close to their customers.
</P>
<P>
``It was a race to get to the hottest points on the map,'' recalls
Jean-Louis Ouellette, distribution director for Ikea, the popular
Swedish furniture maker with more than 120 stores in 25 countries.
``We wanted to serve as many places in Europe as possible within 24
hours, and we think we found the most strategic spot.''
</P>
<P>
Ikea's executives pored over charts and maps until they settled on
a piece of land for their main warehouse near Lyon's Satolas airport,
which offered express-train connections and a modern highway nexus
that put them less than five hours from affluent metropolitan centers
in three countries -- Paris, Barcelona and Turin.
</P>
<P>
Other cities and towns across Europe are reaching across borders
for new economic partnerships based on strategy and location. Antwerp
and Rotterdam have forged an alliance across the Belgian-Dutch border
linking two of Europe's biggest ports. Maastricht, Liege and Aachen
have revived their medieval community in a prosperous triangle across
Dutch, Belgian and German frontiers once rooted in shared waterways.
</P>
<P>
Other regions where common economic interests are conquering
national boundaries include the ``Atlantic Arc'' (Ireland, Wales,
Brittany, the Basque region, Galicia and Portugal), the Baltic-North
Sea connection (Scotland, Scandinavia, Hamburg and Poland) and the
Eastern Triangle of Vienna, Prague and Budapest.
</P>
<P>
In Europe as elsewhere, globalization forces now at work appear to
be making cities more important than nations. By the year 2000, says
Pascal Maragall, the urban economist who is Barcelona's mayor, there
will be 19 cities with at least 20 million people in the greater
metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
``Cities, not nations, will become the principal identity for most
people in the world,'' Maragall says.
</P>
<P>
Ricardo Petrella, the European Community's director of science and
technology forecasting, predicts that a desire to bring government
closer to the people could make nationhood obsolete.
</P>
<P>
By the middle of the next century, he believes there could be
multinational security alliances while real government is carried out
by what he calls ``the international metropolitans.''
</P>
<P>
``In just a few decades, nation-states such as the United States,
Japan, Germany, Italy and France will no longer be so relevant.
Instead, rich regions built around cities such as Osaka, San Francisco
and the four motors of Europe will acquire effective power, because
they can work in tandem with the transnational companies who control
the capital.''
</P>
<P>
Such regional alliances are increasingly seen as a pragmatic and
logical approach to building a more united and prosperous Europe. The
same desire to preserve local identity that motivated much of the
opposition to the Maastricht treaty on European Union is prompting
many voters to demand that national governments yield more power to
the regions.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, an overlooked section of the treaty calls for a Council of
Regions that many believe will quickly assume wider responsibilities
and possibly evolve into a kind of European Senate.
</P>
<P>
Those who are ardent defenders of the European dream now hope to
win more converts among voters by contending that the regional
approach will invest more power and administrative control closer to
the people. At the same time, defense and foreign policy would be
co-ordinated by national governments and raised to a higher level.

 EC Eyes Possible Rich-Poor Tension Among Regions (Lyon) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LYON, France
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Much of the criticism leveled by national
governments and the European Community's executive commission against
the ``Four Motors'' partnership is that they are only interested in
sustaining their high level of prosperity to the exclusion of poorer
neighboring regions.
</P>
<P>
The commission wants the richer areas to ``adopt'' a poor region,
or their funding may be cut. But Europe's wealthier regions are
looking elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
They are now reaching out to counterparts in Asia to lure even more
lucrative investments, widening the disparity with their poorer
neighbors in Europe even more.
</P>
<P>
Alsace, for example, was so eager to capture new Japanese
investment that the regional fathers hired a film-maker to produce a
soap opera for Japanese television that extolled the virtues of their
region. The show, called ``Blue Skies Over Alsace,'' is credited,
along with the presence of a Japanese school in Mulhouse, with
attracting investments by leading Japanese corporations that have
produced more than 5,000 new jobs.
</P>
<P>
``A lot of the attacks are based on the view that we are only a
club of the rich,'' acknowledges Thierry Bernard, general manager of
the Rhone-Alps ``foreign relations'' department. ``It's true that to
join our partnership, we insist on the same high level of industrial
development, to have similar training and economic policies and to be
within one day's travel time.''
</P>
<P>
Those links are intensifying in different areas, including culture,
education, environment and social policies as well as transport and
communications.
</P>
<P>
Business and law students in the ``Four Motors'' cities now must
spend at least one year at universities in one of the other three
cities in order to earn their degree. The aim, says Bernard, ``is
nothing less than to create the kind of European scholar that existed
at the time of Erasmus, who moved about from one great university to
another and felt at ease in several different cultures. That's the
best way to prevent wars.''

 Black Builders May Be Locked Out of S. African Housing Boom 
 (Kwadabeka) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
KWADABEKA, South Africa
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The words painted on the red brick wall
at Phephile Public Primary School spell out a motto that could easily
apply to KwaZumba African Builders. ``The sky is the limit,'' they
say.
</P>
<P>
For Cyril Gwala, managing director of the Durban-based construction
company, the pledge of South Africa's new black-run government to
build 1 million houses in five years means unprecedented opportunity.
As the new South Africa gets started, no other industry stands to gain
more from the political and economic reconstruction of the country.
</P>
<P>
``We don't expect results overnight, but there is a lot to be done
in this country, especially with low-cost housing, and that is where
the black builder will have a chance to rise to the occasion,'' said
Gwala, president of the African Builders Association.
</P>
<P>
The ability of the new government to bring blacks into the
white-dominated economy will be one of the first tests of whether
political change will result in genuine wealth-sharing in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
``Unless there is participation at levels that matter, economic
empowerment for black builders will remain forever an illusion,'' said
Joas Mogale, secretary general of the Johannesburg-based Foundation
for African Business and Consumer Services, a leading business
organization in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The foundation calculates that there is a backlog of 1.4 million
homes in South Africa. As of mid-May the industry was putting up only
about 30,000 homes a year.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela made the five-year
homebuilding plan a campaign centerpiece. That means millions of
dollars will be spent by the new multiracial government on housing,
along with millions more anticipated from international donors.
</P>
<P>
For an industry that has been in a major slump for several years -- 
it has shed 60,000 jobs since 1986 -- the formal end of the apartheid
system of racial separation means the beginning of a boom.
</P>
<P>
Including black builders in the national building campaign will not
be easy. Because apartheid limited the kind of work that black
contractors could do, most are not equipped to handle the large-scale
building that will take place, Mogale and others acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
The builder of a new housing complex in a community just outside
Johannesburg is already running into a problem of finding black
contractors able to secure financing to participate in the project.
</P>
<P>
Graceland, with its pastel-colored single-family homes and streets
called Sunhill Lane and California Grove, is designed to be a model
for the new South Africa. It has been developed by a subsidary of
Murray Roberts, one of the larger white-owned construction companies
in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The first of its kind, Graceland was planned as a multiracial
development of between 500 and 800 low-cost homes built near an
industrial park.
</P>
<P>
Murray Roberts has imposed its own goal of 10 percent
participation by black builders in the Graceland project. However,
making that quota is already proving difficult, because banks contend
that black builders are a high risk and therefore are reluctant to
extend credit to them.
</P>
<P>
Uhuru Madida, a development consultant with Bernhardt Dunstan 
Associates, a housing consultant firm working on Graceland, said there
is concern that the government will be under pressure to build houses
irrespective of who is doing the building. Already, builders black and
white say the construction industry isn't able to pump out more than
100,000 homes a year.
</P>
<P>
``You can't say to the people, `We can't build enough houses
because we are developing black builders,' '' said Nhlanhla
Mjoli-Mncube, who does development strategy for Bernhardt Dunstan.
</P>
<P>
Under apartheid, blacks were shut out of skilled construction work
and management training. Even when the government decided to build
hundreds of thousands of low-cost homes for blacks in racially
segregated townships, the contracts went to white-owned construction
companies.
</P>
<P>
Under apartheid, many loans to black businessmen did not come from
banks but from stokvels , informal groups of black people who used
savings to boost black business.
</P>
<P>
Inspectors were routinely bribed to get necessary permits, and
suppliers demanded cash for all building materials. Suppliers
traditionally have reserved credit for white-owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
But in the new South Africa, a few builders already are succeeding
by teaming up with white-owned companies. KwaZumba, for example, is
thriving because of a partnership with a subsidary of Murray 
Roberts.
</P>
<P>
Gwala struck a deal with Amalgamated Construction Co., which
essentially provides the black builder with technical and financial
assistance. KwaZumba's annual revenues have soared from about $250,000
to more than $2 million in just two years.

 A War of Illusion (Bletchley, England) 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The King hath note of all that they intend,
</P>
<P>
By interceptions which they know not of.
</P>
<P>
-- ``Henry V,'' Act 2, Scene 2
</P>
<P>
BLETCHLEY, England -- Shakespeare was writing about another invasion
of France, of course, but his words, inscribed on a plaque in the
oak-paneled manor house at Bletchley Park, tell as much about what
really happened 50 years ago June 6 as all the tales of blood and
valor on the beaches of Normandy.
</P>
<P>
For what is still far too rarely appreciated, even half a century
later, is how much the climactic battle of World War II was fought and
won in the shadowland of stealth and deception. It was a victory
achieved in no small part by an anonymous army of toymakers, scenery
painters, illusionists and purveyors of electronic make-believe, all
guided by a legion of cryptographic skulkers so secretive that their
work is still not fully known.
</P>
<P>
The de facto headquarters of this looking glass war lay here 46
miles north of London on the 55-acre, still barbed-wire-rimmed remnant
of a once-grand Victorian estate.
</P>
<P>
Here, in a series of drafty frame huts and dank concrete bunkers
shaded by huge flowering chestnut trees, some 7,000 people labored
feverishly on the eve of D-Day to secure the invasion of Hitler's
Europe by first invading and manipulating Hitler's mind.
</P>
<P>
So successful were they at skewing his version of reality that even
as the largest invasion fleet in history hove into sight off Normandy,
the crucial strength of the German war machine was occupied elsewhere,
ambushing imaginary armies, bombarding invisible fleets and repelling
thousands of 3-foot-tall paratroopers made of straw.
</P>
<P>
``If you ask me were the deceptions effective, I would say they
were absolutely vital on D-Day,'' says military historian M.R.D. Foot,
a slim, silver-haired septuagenarian who spent the war staging
commando raids for the British Army. ``We would have been mad to
attempt the invasion without them, precisely because Hitler had so
many more divisions in France than we could land quickly. Had he been
able to mass them to meet us, we would have been finished. And it was
a near enough thing as it was.''
</P>
<P>
But goaded by psychological feints at other corners of his empire,
Hitler ignored an ageless maxim of military strategy: Try to be strong
everywhere and you're not strong anywhere.
</P>
<P>
Alerted by hundreds of landing craft spotted in the lochs of
Scotland, 16 divisions of German troops (Hitler had only seven in
Normandy), stood poised across the North Sea awaiting an imminent
invasion of Norway. The Scottish landing craft were plywood stage
props, the Norwegian invasion a myth.
</P>
<P>
Alarmed by aerial reconnaissance showing hundreds of troop
encampments and tank divisions in southeast England, Hitler held six
armored divisions and 19 other divisions north of the Seine to meet
the Allied landing that was certain to come between Dunkirk and Dieppe
at the narrowest part of the English Channel in the Pas de Calais. The
tents in England were empty, the tanks made of wood.
</P>
<P>
Other German divisions garrisoned southern France in response to an
appearance in Gibraltar by an actor disguised as British Field Marshal
Bernard Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
In the pre-dawn June 6 darkness northeast of Normandy between
LeHavre and Boulogne, fleets of small launches trailing
radar-reflecting balloons pitched and rolled their way toward shore
while above them two squadrons of Royal Air Force bombers loosed a
specially designed pattern of aluminum chaff and electronic signals
designed to appear on German radar as a huge fleet of warships. Ten
miles offshore, screened by banks of smoke, the launch crews switched
on sound amplifiers, touching off the rattling of anchor chains, the
squeal of steam derricks lowering heavy objects and the thump of
landing craft banging the sides of transports.
</P>
<P>
They were all illusions, only a few among thousands in a strategy
of deception as old as the Trojan horse, and often imbued with what
one historian referred to as ``the Monty Python element.''
</P>
<P>
But as captured Wehrmacht documents would later show, it was
tremendously effective. It hopelessly confused the Germans and forced
them to reserve or divert armored units that, properly positioned,
would have blown the Allied landings off the map. Still, as Foot and
others emphasize, the deceptions would have been useless without the
work at Bletchley Park, where a bizarre band of eccentric geniuses had
broken the German codes in the war's earliest years and had been
reading Germany's most secret radio traffic ever since.
</P>
<P>
``What you have to remember about deceptions,'' says F.H. Hinsley,
the Cambridge professor who authored the official history of British
intelligence in World War II, ``is that if they're to be successful,
two things are imperative: First, the enemy must be kept totally in
the dark about what you don't want him to know, and second, you must
know everything he's thinking all the time, especially when he's
confronted with what you want him to believe.''
</P>
<P>
Thanks to Bletchley's early and long-secret penetration of German
radio traffic, Hinsley says, ``we were able to locate, early on, the
entire German espionage network in Britain, eliminate parts of it and
use others to feed Hitler disinformation. We were also able to learn
Hitler's thinking about where and when the invasion would eventually
come, play to his prejudices and hunches, and learn when and whether
he took our bait. We were reading his mind all the time.''
</P>
<P>
In the nearly 20 years since F.W. Winterbotham's book ``The Ultra
Secret'' first made public the extent of Allied code-breaking in World
War II, much has been written about Bletchley Park and its cast of
code-cracking irregulars: the sputtering Oxford dons, neurasthenic
chess champions and rumpled, unwashed linguists recruited to attack
and analyze the Germans' supposedly impenetrable Enigma cipher.
</P>
<P>
What novelist, after all, could dream up a cryptographic
protagonist like Alan Turing, the stammering, nail-biting mathematical
genius and computer pioneer, who bicycled in a gas mask to avoid hay
fever, ran long distances in tweeds, listened nightly to a BBC
children's program about Larry the Lamb and, nine years after the war,
killed himself by coating an apple with cyanide and biting into it?
</P>
<P>
It was Turing, building on cryptanalytic breakthroughs made before
the war by a band of brilliant Polish mathematicians, who led the
frenzied intellectual scramble at Bletchley Park, aided by several
thousand tireless young female clerks and the army of abstract
academics one clerk remembers as ``just absolute boffins. ... They
just weren't in the real world at all.''
</P>
<P>
Their work consisted of three basic areas. First, it involved the
technical challenge of engineering what became the first electronic
programmable computers, not only to solve the increasing number and
complexity of German ciphers, but to greatly reduce the time for
decoding individual messages.
</P>
<P>
Second, it involved meticulous analysis of the messages themselves,
not only for the subtleties of linguistic translation but, in light of
what was already known of the sender and receiver, their branches of
service, their present tactical situations and so on.
</P>
<P>
Finally it involved the dissemination of this ``Ultra'' secret
information to specific commanders on a need-to-know basis, through
the small number of liaison intelligence officers cleared for Ultra
security.
</P>
<P>
In the early days of the war, with many ciphers still unbroken and
many messages read only days later, largely for strategic value, these
tasks absorbed the labors of only a few hundred people. But as the
code-breaking process was perfected, and its machinery multiplied, so
did Bletchley's manpower needs. By D-Day, some 6,000 clerks and 1,000
``boffins'' had overflowed the estate's dozens of prefabricated wooden
huts and bombproof bunkers into auxiliary stations in nearby country
houses and the London suburbs.
</P>
<P>
Nearly one-fifth of the workers arrived in the final few months
before the invasion, as the code-breakers geared up for the blizzard
of messages anticipated as the destruction of German land lines would
force more and more Wehrmacht communiques onto the airwaves, and as
the code-breakers raced to read them in time to give them tactical
value.
</P>
<P>
The speed was most needed to trace the moment-by-moment movement of
German army units, particularly armored units, in the first hours and
days of the invasion. Would Hitler sniff out what was really happening
on the beaches of Normandy and move to crush it? Or would he remain
the psychological prisoner of the deception artists of the Allied
cause?
</P>
<P>
The Allied deceptions of D-Day were born from a wedding of
desperation and guile and were incomparably British from the start.
</P>
<P>
Many writers credit them to the country's horrific losses in World
War I and England's subsequent desperate search for military measures
other than the suicidal frontal assault.
</P>
<P>
But Foot notes as well a rich tradition of deception throughout
British history, dating at least to William the Conqueror, who in 1066
had Viking allies stage a diversionary raid on Yorkshire so he could
land in Sussex from Normandy almost unopposed.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of World War II, says Hinsley, ``we simply had no
alternative but deception. We were so weak we had either to outsmart
the enemy or be defeated.''
</P>
<P>
Thus in the darkest days of 1940, a tiny British force under Gen.
Archibald Wavell literally inflated its strength with blow-up dummy
tanks and artillery, and outwitted an enormous Italian army in Libya,
capturing 130,000 prisoners.
</P>
<P>
It was nothing particularly new for Wavell. He had once been part
of a World War I operation in Palestine that captured Beersheba from
the Turks by showering the tobacco-starved enemy from the air with
opium-laced cigarettes and then walking to victory across their
sleeping forms.
</P>
<P>
Wavell's Libyan success prompted a memo in which he argued
convincingly for a new concept of deception-a highly clandestine
central clearinghouse for all Allied deception plans, the London
Controlling Section (LCS), keyed to orchestrating them into a single
grand strategy. From that beginning, fueled by the technical and
analytical breakthroughs at Bletchley Park, grew ``Operation
Bodyguard,'' the myriad deceptions that ultimately ensured the D-Day
landings.
</P>
<P>
Month by month, as U.S. and Canadian armies poured off ships in
Britain for the long buildup to Operation Overlord, the LCS inflated
Hitler's picture of the number that came ashore. For every dozen
regiments that disembarked, British-controlled Nazi agents would add
one or two in their reports to Hitler. For every division of armor,
Hitler would hear through diplomatic circles there were more.
</P>
<P>
By May, Ultra intercepts showed German intelligence credited the
Allies with having nearly double the 49 divisions they actually had in
England. Most of the imaginary units, augmented by real units in other
areas, were eventually united into the largest single deception of
Operation Overlord, the 900,000-man First U.S. Army Group (FUSAG). Its
purported leader was the one general who -- Bletchley intercepts showed
 -- Hitler feared more than any other: George S. Patton.
</P>
<P>
Patton's army, headquartered in Kent, just across from Calais, was
more than just a rumor. Its regimental names appeared in newspaper
wedding and social announcements and even the occasional obituary.
German wireless operators picked up radio transmissions from its jeep
and tank drivers. Radio disc jockeys dedicated big-band numbers to it
from regimental girlfriends. Mythical divisions were described right
down to their mythical shoulder patches.
</P>
<P>
The whole FUSAG, Hitler learned from a variety of sources, was
destined to hit the beaches of France at the closest point to
Germany's vital industrial heartland, the very spot Bletchley
intercepts had shown Hitler betting on all along: the Pas de Calais.
</P>
<P>
The timing was still uncertain, German troops were told by Berlin.
Maybe July. Any landing anywhere else before that would probably be
just a feint.
</P>
<P>
Several weeks before D-Day, Foot, an intelligence officer with the
British Army's Special Air Services Brigade, was ordered by his
commanding officer to prepare a deception of his own.
</P>
<P>
``I was told the order had come down to parachute two groups of men
into Normandy,'' he remembers. ``They would be armed with light
pistols and gramophones.''
</P>
<P>
The men -- two officers, two sergeants and six enlisted men in each
group -- would all be volunteers. One group would be dropped between Le
Havre and Rouen, the other behind Omaha Beach southeast of the village
of Issigny-sur-Mer. They were part of the sound effects crew for
``Operation Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
Titanic involved the dropping of thousands of dummy parachutists in
advance of the real airborne drops of D-Day.
</P>
<P>
``The dummies were about three feet tall, but fully uniformed and
fashioned quite to half-scale,'' Foot says. ``In searchlights they
looked exactly like real paratroopers.'' They were made of straw by
professional toymakers (``there was a shortage of toys during the war
because the toymakers were so occupied with deceptions'') and were
designed to explode on impact. ``But in practice it had been
discovered that they didn't always explode. Hence the need for more
sound effects.''
</P>
<P>
Foot's gramophonists were to be dropped in advance of the dummy
paratroopers, so the doll landings would trigger the sounds of rifle
fire, the rattle of machine guns, the crump of mortar explosions,
shouted orders and even a snatch of properly British profanity. The
recorded battle was to last about 30 minutes. Then the sound effects
men were to hide themselves until the invasion caught up with them.
</P>
<P>
By most conventional measures, the airborne operations on D-Day
were a disaster. The weather was marginal for jumping and many planes
lost their way. Others were piloted by novices who panicked when they
encountered flak and dropped their jumpers far off course. Many troops
landed in flooded fields and drowned, and some landed in the English
Channel. But with parachutes coming down everywhere, some real, some
dummy, the mobile German units called out to deal with the attack were
hopelessly confused about which to pursue. Command centers fielding
numerous reports of landings were unable to deduce a pattern to the
Allied attack.
</P>
<P>
The chaos was furthered by the French underground, which, in
accordance with longstanding LCS plans, began severing telephone
cables, exploding junction boxes and dynamiting poles. Which in turn
forced the confounded Germans onto the radio waves, where their
frustration could be heard and savored in Bletchley Park.
</P>
<P>
All the chasing around after parachutists distracted the Germans
into thinking their quarry was inland. Few noticed that the previously
invasion-proof weather had suddenly improved. No one thought to look
for what was advancing on them -- from the sea.
</P>
<P>
One enters a time warp on visiting Bletchley Park these days. The
estate is owned jointly by the British government and British Telecom,
the once government-owned, now privatized telephone company, and for
the past 50 years only a fraction of the buildings have been used,
primarily as a place to train postal workers and air traffic
controllers.
</P>
<P>
The clock on the manor house has been stopped since anyone can
remember. The bunkers and huts that sifted Enigma and other ciphers
wear the aura of timeless and banal utility that once cloaked the same
sort of WWII buildings on the Washington Mall. To all intents and
purposes the whole place appears frozen in 1945.
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, plans surfaced to level Bletchley Park to make
room for housing and industry. The plans prompted a small but fervent
protest and the formation of a small but energetic historical trust
that now holds regular open-house weekends here where visitors can
view code-breaking machines, pace the empty, mildewed bunkers and
learn something of the profound and long-secret history of the place.

 Breast Self-Examination No Easy Task for Elderly 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What's wrong with this picture: A woman stands in front of a
mirror, holding one arm over her head. Her fingertips press her bare
breast in concentric circles. She looks for changes in her nipple, or
on the breast itself.
</P>
<P>
Pretty standard for breast self-examination, you say?
</P>
<P>
Not if you have arthritis and can't hold your arm over your head.
</P>
<P>
Not if your muscle tone is poor.
</P>
<P>
Not if your eyes are dimming.
</P>
<P>
Not if your fingers are less sensitive than they used to be.
</P>
<P>
Not, in fact, if you are getting old.
</P>
<P>
Breast cancer is vastly more common in women past menopause -- 
indeed, age is the single most powerful risk factor for breast cancer,
and the risk keeps rising as age increases. For example, a woman has a
1-in-10 chance of getting breast cancer by the age of 80, but only a
1-in-2,426 chance of getting it by the age of 30.
</P>
<P>
Although lung cancer has exceeded breast cancer as causing the
largest number of cancer deaths in women, among older women breast
cancer is still the No. 1 killer.
</P>
<P>
Yet, says Joyce Guillory, most preventive information is aimed at
younger women.
</P>
<P>
For many older women whose health is beginning to fail, ``the
standard breast-exam guidelines can be daunting,'' she says. Guillory,
a nursing specialist in the psychosocial aspects of cancer, is an
assistant professor and director of the Cancer Prevention Awareness
Project at Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
She did a survey in the Atlanta area of a group of 50
African-American women between the ages of 60 and 96 to determine what
type of cancer-prevention techniques they use.
</P>
<P>
Although white women have a higher rate of developing breast
cancer, she noted, the mortality rate among African-American women is
19 percent higher.
</P>
<P>
Guillory found only 18 percent of the black women in her study had
regular mammograms, special X-rays used as a common screening
technique to detect breast cancer. Not surprisingly, says Guillory,
the women cited transportation, costs and fear of pain as barriers to
getting mammograms.
</P>
<P>
But more surprising to her was that 80 percent of the women did not
know the correct way to examine their own breasts, a preventive
measure that cancer experts have been advocating for more than a
decade as one of the most effective means of discovering breast
tumors.
</P>
<P>
``They were just sort of patting around, feeling for a lump,''
Guillory found.
</P>
<P>
The standard breast self-examination (BSE) requires a woman to
stand in front of a mirror and hold her arms over her head as she
visually examines her breasts. Even examination lying down requires
the arm to be raised.
</P>
<P>
Palpation is done with the fingertips. So even learning the
standard method of BSE didn't help many of these women because the
effects of aging were an impediment.
</P>
<P>
She found that 38 percent of the women had arthritis. ``And then,''
she noted, ``the older we get, the more our joint range of motion
diminishes as does the tactile sensation in our fingers. Shoulders,
elbows and wrists get stiff.''
</P>
<P>
The women assured Guillory that they would certainly examine their
breasts if they were shown how they could do it efficiently.
</P>
<P>
As a result, she devised mostly simple and common-sense
modifications to the standard instructions and taught them to the
survey group.
</P>
<P>
Her six-step program and her survey results will appear this summer
in the Journal of Women and Aging.
</P>
<P>
Her program for older women includes these steps:
</P>
<P>
-- If vision and dexterity are a problem, enlist a trusted friend or
family member to help.
</P>
<P>
-- If performing a self-exam alone, visually inspect the breasts
using a magnifying mirror. Look for changes such as dimples,
difference in size between the two breasts, a lump, thickening
roughness or a sore.
</P>
<P>
-- Lie down on the back, beginning the examination under the armpit.
If fingertips are losing their sensitivity, use the palm of the hand.
Palms are much more sensitive than fingertips, Guillory says.
</P>
<P>
-- Letting the breast rest on one hand, stroke it with the palm of
the other hand beginning at the chest wall and moving towards the
nipple. Feel for changes in texture as well as lumps.
</P>
<P>
-- Squeeze the nipple gently, looking for any discharge. Repeat the
procedure on the other breast.

``Rome: The Eternal City'' is alive with views of its rooftop
gardens, pink and ochre stucco glistening in the sun, and everlasting
monuments and locations such as St. Peter's Basilica, the Coliseum,
Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, Baths of Caracalla, Sistine Chapel, Via
Veneto, and Piazza Navona. There are people in Rome, too-people who
sip espresso at sidewalk coffee bars, people who dine in outdoor cafes
scattered throughout the city, across the Seven Hills and along the
banks of the Tiber River. The artwork in Rome is bountiful: jeweled
mosaics, glowing frescos, tapestries, vaulted ceilings and palatial
rooms where masterworks by Bernini, Michaelangelo and Raphael live on.
</P>
<P>
``Barcelona: Archive of Courtesy'' looks at a city that has been
the vanguard for Spanish art and culture for 2,000 years. Barcelona's
wonders range from the soaring spires of Antonio Gaudi's Sagrada
Familia to the winding streets of the Gothic Quarter and the modern
works of Pablo Picasso, Joan Miro and Salvador Dali. The people in the
region of Catalonia, between the waters of the Mediterranean and the
slopes of the Pyrsenees, remain bound to their glorious past even in
the art of futuristic Olympic City in Montjuic Park.
</P>
<P>
``Seville: Heart of Andalusia'' explores the city's cathedral,
the world's largest Gothic building; the Roman ruins of Italica; the
Moorish palace of Alcazar; Santa Cruz and La Giralda, one-time center

 Are Resources `Wasted' On Terminally Ill? 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new study calls into question the assumption that hospitals could
save lots of money by forgoing or withdrawing treatment in futile
cases.
</P>
<P>
The study looked at more than 4,000 very sick patients at five
major medical centers. Researchers calculated how much money would
have been saved if life-sustaining treatment had been withdrawn as
soon as a patient was deemed to have less than a 1 percent chance of
surviving two months.
</P>
<P>
``The public believes that valuable resources are `wasted' on
terminally ill patients, although the data to support this conclusion
are frail at best,'' said Joanne Lynn, a Dartmouth Medical School
physician who presented the findings this month at the American
Geriatrics Society's annual meeting in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
Only 115 patients of the 4,301 studied had an estimated 1 percent
or less chance of surviving two months. All but one of those 115 died
within six months, and 75 percent died within five days. But only 27
would have died earlier if life-sustaining treatment had been
withdrawn or withheld.
</P>
<P>
``The vast majority of persons sick enough to qualify for a 1
percent threshold would save no more than a few days of expenses by
dying early,'' said Lynn.
</P>
<P>
The patients were in the advanced stage of coma, acute respiratory
failure, multiple organ system failure, chronic obstructive lung
disease, congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, metastatic colon cancer
or inoperable lung cancer. All but 14 were on one of three types of
life-sustaining treatment -- mechanical ventilator, blood-pressure
booster or kidney dialysis.
</P>
<P>
By forgoing or withdrawing such treatment for those patients, the
study found, doctors would have saved 183 hospital days out of 1,688
days. The estimated dollar savings would be $1.1 million, or about 12
percent.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 75 percent of the savings would have come from stopping
treatment in five cases, including four aged 50 or younger. Two had
bone-marrow transplants, and one had a liver transplant.
</P>
<P>
Not only is it hard to identify patients likely to die within a few
days, the study found, but those who can be so identified often are
not receiving life-prolonging treatment. Sixty-one percent had a
do-not-resuscitate order written by the fifth day of hospitalization,
and 83 percent had one by the time of death.
</P>
<P>
The study included patients at five centers: Beth Israel Hospital
in Boston; MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland; Duke University
Medical Center in Durham, N.C.; St. Joseph's Hospital in Marshfield,
Wis.; and the UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles. Researchers from
Dartmouth, George Washington and Johns Hopkins also worked on the
project.
</P>
<P>
More could be saved if treatment were withheld from patients with a
5 percent or 10 percent chance of surviving two months. But use of
such guidelines to forgo treatment, the study found, ``would result in
only modest savings, and those only through what will seem to be
inequitable and unpalatable curtailing of life support in a few young
patients.''

 More Americans Keep Their Teeth

American Dental Association, are another indication of a dramatic
improvement in the oral health of Americans in the past several
decades. Much dental disease ``is concentrated in an increasingly
smaller portion of the population,'' a JADA commentary concluded.
</P>
<P>
The percent of toothless Americans dropped from 9.9 percent in the
early 1970s to 3.8 percent in the mid-1980s, the research found. This
represented a decline in the number of toothless adults from 7.3
million to 3.7 million, even as the working population increased by 24
million. The rate of toothlessness among those 55 to 64 years of age
was cut in half, from 29.7 percent to 14.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
L. Jackson Brown, director of epidemiology and oral-disease
prevention at NIDR, drew his conclusions from two surveys on tooth
loss among employed Americans, one conducted by the National Center
for Health Statistics in 1971 to 1974 and one done by NIDR in 1985-86.
</P>
<P>
The findings may indicate that Americans are keeping their teeth
about a decade longer than they used to. People 35 to 44 in the 1980s
survey had the same number of teeth as people 25 to 34 in the 1970s
survey, for example, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
``Prevention of tooth loss is extending to that part of the
population which is most at risk,'' Brown concluded, calling this
``perhaps the most encouraging finding'' of the study. Still, he said
the conclusions could not be extended to unemployed adults nor to
those over 64, who were not included in the analysis.

 Accidents in Youth Baseball Put Focus on Safety Gear 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Baseball may be more than America's favorite sport. It may be one
of its most dangerous, at least for Little Leaguers and their peers.
</P>
<P>
Sports-medicine experts and pediatricians have increasingly been
concerned about baseball injuries and have been lobbying for
additional protective gear and safety equipment to be required for
children's leagues. They point to leg injuries sustained while sliding
into bases and head or chest injuries received when hit by a ball or
bat.
</P>
<P>
That effort was underscored this month with the deaths of two
children -- a 9 year old in Hershey, Pa., who was hit in the chest with
a pitched ball, and a 3 year old in Texas who was hit in the chest
while playing ball with his 6-year-old brother.
</P>
<P>
Each child apparently died when the force of the ball threw his
heart into wild arrhythmias, although medical specialists said they do
not know precisely how or why this occurs.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that 5 million youngsters aged 5 to 14 years play
baseball throughout the country, and many are never seriously injured.
But in 1990, more than 280,000 baseball players between the ages of 5
and 24 were injured, according to the Consumer Product Safety
Commission, which also lists baseball as the children's sport with the
most fatal accidents.
</P>
<P>
About five players each year die from injuries, said Daniel J.
Levy, a Baltimore pediatrician who is a spokesman for the American
Academy of Pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
At a consensus meeting in Boston early this year, convened by the
National Youth Sports Foundation for the Prevention of Athletic
Injuries Inc., sports-medicine specialists examined how to reduce the
number of injuries in baseball.
</P>
<P>
The group recommended children wear helmets at all times while on
the field and batting, and that they have safety goggles while
batting. To help prevent injuries like the death of the Hershey, Pa.,
boy, the group said youths, especially those under the age of 12,
should wear a padded safety vest while batting or pitching to help
prevent injury when hit by balls. The experts also called for face
protectors for children while they are at bat and on base.
</P>
<P>
They also urged the use of special balls with softer centers. These
are not as dangerous when they hit a child.
</P>
<P>
Many of the group's conclusions were echoed in a statement issued
by the Sports Medicine and Fitness Committee of the American Academy
of Pediatrics in April.
</P>
<P>
Levy said the academy is highlighting baseball safety this summer
to draw attention to ``approximately 4 million sports injuries (from
all sports) to children, most of which go unreported.''
</P>
<P>
The Baltimore Orioles have lent a hand to the effort. The
major-league team designated June 15 as ``Youth Fitness and Safety
Day'' and will feature Olympic gymnast Dominique Dawes demonstrating
good warm-up techniques.
</P>
<P>
Levy, along with athletic trainer Katy Curran of the Children's
National Medical Center, is also setting up seminars on safety for
coaches and parents.
</P>
<P>
Levy said the American Academy of Pediatrics is promoting these
principles: Be certain youngsters are in good physical condition
before playing ball, are aware of proper nutrition and know the
importance of warm-up and stretching exercises. Make sure parents and
coaches know cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and have someone
familiar with CPR at every game.
</P>
<P>
``We want to promote the aspect of parents knowing how to deal with
injury and, God forbid, catastrophe,'' Levy said. Prevent injuries by
using appropriate equipment.
</P>
<P>
The use of the equipment advocated by the National Youth Sports
Foundation has been controversial. Some parents and coaches have been
reluctant to use some of the gear, arguing it interferes with how the
game has been traditionally played.
</P>
<P>
Also, says Curran, ``there is a feeling that the kids will resist
because they're afraid they'll be called sissies or geeks.''
</P>
<P>
But Levy dismisses these arguments. ``I think it's a bogus issue,''
he said. ``The kids do fine, especially if the equipment is mandated
for all of them.''

 Eye Injuries in the Major Leagues 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Free agency, salary wars, the designated-hitter rule, divisional
restructuring. What will the National Pastime stumble into next? How
about high-velocity ocular blunt trauma?
</P>
<P>
Because baseball accounts for more sports-related eye injuries than
any other sport, five New York eye doctors have conducted a study of
``ocular trauma'' in major-league baseball players.
</P>
<P>
A total of 21 players suffered eye injuries between July 1991 and
July 1992, the doctors reported in a letter to the New England Journal
of Medicine. Eleven were hit by a batted ball -- including six who were
up at bat themselves. Others were hit by a thrown ball, injured in a
collision with another player, caught dirt in the eye or simply rubbed
their eyes the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
Five of the injuries forced a player to miss one or more games. The
severest injury was to a pitcher hit by a line drive. He suffered
bleeding, swelling and inflammation in the eye and a scratched cornea.
</P>
<P>
All eventually recovered full vision.
</P>
<P>
The relatively large size of a baseball -- compared, say, with a
racketball or the sharp end of a stick -- actually makes it less
dangerous to the eye. A baseball is more likely to strike the bony
surroundings of the orbit, rather than reaching the eyeball itself.
</P>
<P>
The Consumer Product Safety Commission estimates 39,526 eye
injuries from sports or recreation were treated in hospital emergency
rooms in 1991. Baseball accounted for 18 percent of those -- more than
any other sport.
</P>
<P>
Baseball was the most common cause of eye injuries in youngsters
age 5 to 14, second to basketball in 15 to 24 year olds and third
behind basketball and racket sports in those 25 and older.
</P>
<P>
For players at bat or in the on-deck circle, the doctors recommend
use of a plastic transparent face guard that attaches to the batting
helmet and protects the face and eyes.

 Tracking Tickets to Cultural Events Abroad 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'm an opera fan, and I was determined on a recent trip to Milan to
get a ticket to La Scala, one of the world's most famous opera houses.
I phoned and faxed Italy weeks before I left home, but failed to book
a seat until the last minute -- and then only after I showed up at the
box office. What luck, but what a hassle.
</P>
<P>
One of the great delights of Europe is the abundance of top-rate
cultural presentations -- theater, opera, ballet and concerts. But one
of Europe's great challenges, at least at the major performance halls,
is getting a ticket for the day you are going to be in town. Often it
is difficult to find out in advance what will be playing or even
whether a performance is scheduled.
</P>
<P>
But there are ways to get this information -- and to get tickets. If
you want to reserve seats before you depart, at least four U.S.-based
organizations book shows in Great Britain, France, Russia and
elsewhere in Europe. Tourism information offices can provide some
help, and so can the concierge in the hotel where you will be staying.
</P>
<P>
But sometimes your best bet is to trust your luck at the box
office. This is the strategy of John Philip Couch, author of ``The
Opera Lover's Guide to Europe.'' So much opera is performed in so many
cities, he says, that you should be able to get a seat on the spot
almost anywhere except at major theaters. Even if the box office is
sold out, you may be able to buy from a ticket holder on the street,
and many theaters sell standing-room tickets an hour or two before
performances and, at the last minute, reserved tickets that have not
been picked up.
</P>
<P>
``With a Eurailpass, a recent copy of Thomas Cook's ``European
Timetable,' and lots of stamina,'' Couch says, ``it is conceivable
that you could see 15 different operas in 15 different cities in the
same number of days.'' My own experience has taught me to try to book
in advance if there is a performance I absolutely want to see -- which
is why I began working on a ticket to La Scala as soon as I knew the
date I would be in Milan. First I called the Italian Government
Tourist Office in New York, which maintains a schedule of
performances. An information clerk gave me the fax and phone number of
the La Scala box office. So far, so good.
</P>
<P>
I immediately faxed La Scala and just as quickly ran into a big
road block resulting from the theater's complex ticketing procedures.
La Scala replied promptly, but noted that I had missed its deadline
for advance ticket sales -- although my trip was still weeks away. So I
phoned La Scala, talked to an English-speaking official and got this
explanation:
</P>
<P>
For each production, La Scala sets specific time periods for seat
requests from abroad; these are listed in the theater's ``Postal
Bookings Calendar.'' I planned to be in Milan on April 21, which meant
that my fax should have been dated between Feb. 16 and March 3, the
official told me. I had missed by a few days. Confusing? Yes.
Aggravating? Oh, yes. But this is the way it is done.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, I began my quest for tickets too late. ``Try at the box
office when you get here,'' the official advised. And so I did. In
mid-afternoon on the day of the performance, I checked in at the
counter. ``Sold out,'' the clerk said, which was what I had expected.
But as I turned to go, he asked, ``Just one ticket?'' I nodded, he
punched some commands into his computer and out popped a $35 ticket in
the First Gallery. I don't know where he found that ticket, but I had
my seat at La Scala.
</P>
<P>
Not all European tickets are so hard to come by. Among the helpful
resources:
</P>
<P>
-- Booking offices: For a fee, several U.S.-based firms can reserve
seats in advance in selected European theaters.
</P>
<P>
Good Show! London Theatre Information Booking Service of
Richmond, Calif., (510) 236-5126, specializes in London performances.
</P>
<P>
Allegro Enterprises Inc. of New York City, (800) 666-3553 or (212)
666-6700, books tickets to Eastern European theaters, and especially
to opera and ballet productions at the famed Kirov Mariinsky Theater
in St. Petersburg and the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Keith Prowse Co. of New York City, (800) 669-8687 or (212)
398-1430, is a ticket agency for cultural and sporting events
throughout Great Britain and Ireland and for many theaters in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Edwards Edwards of New York City, (800) 223-6108 or (212)
944-0290, is a ticket agency for performances in London,
Stratford-upon-Avon, Dublin, Paris, Berlin, Copenhagen and elsewhere
in Scandinavia. It also handles tickets for the Edinburgh Festival
(Aug. 14 to Sept. 3) and the Edinburgh Military Tattoo (Aug. 7 to 27).
</P>
<P>
-- National tourism offices: Most European tourism offices, many of
which are located in New York, can provide guidance on how to get
tickets at major theaters in their respective countries.
</P>
<P>
-- Hotel concierges: If you are staying in a hotel with a staff
concierge, phone, fax or write ahead and ask the concierge to obtain
tickets for the productions you want to see. You may have to pay a
premium price, so be sure to specify a maximum amount you are willing
to pay. And don't forget to include a good tip.
</P>
<P>
-- Opera publications: In his guide, opera buff Couch lists a
half-dozen U.S. and European magazines that print European opera
schedules for the month ahead. He suggests getting a copy of one of
them. Even in a foreign language, the listings are reasonably
understandable.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, he recommends Opera News, published by the
Metropolitan Opera Guild. An introductory subscription (17 issues) is
$21.95. For information: (212) 769-7000. In Europe, the magazines can
be found on newsstands. In England, look for Opera or Opera Now; in
France, Opera International; in Germany, Das Opernglas; and in
Switzerland, Opernwelt.
</P>
<P>
Couch's book, ``The Opera Lover's Guide to Europe'' is full of
useful information about getting opera tickets. The 284-page first
edition, published in 1991, is available for $15.95 from Limelight
Editions of New York. An updated version will be published in the
fall. To order: (212) 532-5525.

 The Glory That Is Rome, Seville and Barcelona 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The glory that is Rome, Barcelona and Seville is captured on three
new volumes in the Museum City Video series released by V.I.E.W.
Video.
</P>
<P>
The first three volumes in the series, which looks at great cities
through the eyes of their artists, architects and poets, focused on
Florence, Venice and London. The London video was a finalist in the
Special Interest Video Association Awards.
</P>
<P>
Upcoming releases include volumes on Vatican City, Jerusalem and
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The videos list for $19.98 each. Running time for the Rome cassette
is 45 minutes. The other two run 40 minutes each. To order, call
1-800-843-9843.
</P>
<P>
``Rome: The Eternal City'' is alive with views of its rooftop
gardens, pink and ochre stucco glistening in the sun, and everlasting
monuments and locations such as St. Peter's Basilica, the Coliseum,
Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, Baths of Caracalla, Sistine Chapel, Via
Veneto, and Piazza Navona. There are people in Rome, too-people who
sip espresso at sidewalk coffee bars, people who dine in outdoor cafes
scattered throughout the city, across the Seven Hills and along the
banks of the Tiber River. The artwork in Rome is bountiful: jeweled
mosaics, glowing frescos, tapestries, vaulted ceilings and palatial
rooms where masterworks by Bernini, Michaelangelo and Raphael live on.
</P>
<P>
``Barcelona: Archive of Courtesy'' looks at a city that has been
the vanguard for Spanish art and culture for 2,000 years. Barcelona's
wonders range from the soaring spires of Antonio Gaudi's Sagrada
Familia to the winding streets of the Gothic Quarter and the modern
works of Pablo Picasso, Joan Miro and Salvador Dali. The people in the
region of Catalonia, between the waters of the Mediterranean and the
slopes of the Pyrsenees, remain bound to their glorious past even in
the art of futuristic Olympic City in Montjuic Park.
</P>
<P>
``Seville: Heart of Andalusia'' explores the city's cathedral,
the world's largest Gothic building; the Roman ruins of Italica; the
Moorish palace of Alcazar; Santa Cruz and La Giralda, one-time center
for the city's Jews, who like the Romans, Visigoths, Muslims and
Christians, left their imprint on Seville.

 Health-Care System's Unrecognized Providers 
 Trafford is editor of The Washington Post's Health section. 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
``I don't know that I ever had a conversation with my husband about
what pediatrician we would use,'' said the mother of a teen-age
daughter. ``And if you have a husband like mine and most of my
friends, they don't ever want to go to the doctor, they don't ever
want to confess that they don't feel good, and it is you who are
probing and pushing and calling and making the appointments.''
</P>
<P>
Everybody around her smiled and nodded in recognition of the
familiar scenario. For centuries, women have been the unpaid
``health-care providers,'' dragging their spouses, children and aging
relatives to the fountain of medical services and then tending them at
the bedside at home.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the woman concluded, ``Women have a greater stake in
the health-care-reform debate than men. ... We're the ones in the
middle -- juggling all the health-care decisions, our jobs, our
child-rearing.''
</P>
<P>
This could start sounding like another episode in the Big Whine
from the middle-aged ``sandwich generation'' if the speaker weren't
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and the subject weren't the most
far-reaching domestic legislation in almost 30 years.
</P>
<P>
But as Congress slugs out the details of various proposals,
something crucial is missing in the debate and it has to do with
women.
</P>
<P>
Long stereotyped as nurturing handmaidens, women play a central
role in medicine. They are the biggest users of health care and go to
the doctor more often than men. They are also the major ``providers''
as nurses -- 2.2 million strong -- and unpaid family care givers.
</P>
<P>
Yet, for starters, women are sparsely represented on the
congressional committees designing legislation -- and none of the
powerful committee chairmen has a female face. The debate itself has
been narrowly focused.
</P>
<P>
Following the stereotype that guys do numbers, most of the
political discussion has been about costs and strategies to pay for
extending the current system to the 38 million people who have no
insurance, with High-Noon shootouts over ``employer mandates'' and
``premium caps.''
</P>
<P>
There's been very little talk about the quality and types of
services that are needed -- and not needed -- in an era of chronic
illness and an aging population.
</P>
<P>
``It is a male model versus a female model,'' said Virginia Trotter
Betts, president of the American Nurses Association. As she explained
last week at a conference on care giving by the International Women's
Media Foundation, the male model is the status quo with its emphasis
on high-tech remedies of acute medical problems; the female model
shifts the focus from cures to care -- not just to preventive and
primary care for healthy people but also supportive care for people
with chronic conditions.
</P>
<P>
If the debate paid more attention to the female model, noted Betts,
``there would be a dramatic change in winners and losers.''
</P>
<P>
The view that chronic illness is getting short shrift in the debate
is supported by a recent report from the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation. As the foundation's president, Steven A. Schroeder, put
it: ``Even after a year of intense debate about health-care reform,
the disparity between the needs of people with chronic health
conditions and the way the medical care system is currently organized
is not being addressed in the debate.''
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the way for Congress to get the message about chronic
illness is to pay more attention to a largely invisible volunteer army
of an estimated 18 million family care givers in this country. Their
responsibilities go beyond the normal raising of a family. Their
patients have such chronic diseases as multiple sclerosis,
Alzheimer's, cerebral palsy. They work as unpaid home health aides on
average four hours a day, seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
These calculations come from the National Family Caregivers
Association, a non-profit organization in Kensington, Md., for people
who care for a parent, child, sibling or spouse with a disabling
illness. ``We're the people who push the wheelchair,'' said the
association's president, Suzanne Mintz, whose husband has MS. ``We're
so invisible.''
</P>
<P>
If these volunteer health workers -- virtually all women -- were paid
$7.25 an hour, their total annual bill would come to an estimated $190
billion a year. If their patients had to be cared for in institutions
and other community facilities, it would cost the nation's taxpayers
even more. These care givers aren't looking for pay; they are looking
for benefits that would reimburse home health care and provide support
and respite care for care givers.
</P>
<P>
But whenever long-term care benefits come up in the debate, the
Mayday Dollar Button is pushed and voters are cautioned it may be too
expensive.
</P>
<P>
So here's another way in the health-care debate to look at the
financing issue. The country actually has a health-care credit of $190
billion a year -- thanks largely to American women. If these volunteer
Florence Nightingales should stage a work stoppage for a week,
Congress would soon find out the real dimensions of the health-care
cost crisis.

 MTV's Fast-Paced New Action Show, `Dead at 21' 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
``Everybody seems to like my name,'' said Jack Noseworthy. ``I
never thought about changing it. Not for a second.''
</P>
<P>
Joe Davola, senior vice president of MTV Productions/MTV
Development, can relate to that. ``Seinfeld'' writer Larry David was
so taken by the name that ``Crazy Joe Davola'' became part of the NBC
sitcom.
</P>
<P>
Soon Noseworthy and Davola may have one more thing in common -- a
cult following. That will depend on the reception to ``Dead at 21,''
the music television network's first foray into the action-adventure
genre.
</P>
<P>
The series gets a sneak preview Thursday night and starting June 15
will run Wednesday nights.
</P>
<P>
``Dead at 21'' features Ed and Maria, both 20, who are running for
their lives. It seems that as an infant, Ed (played by Noseworthy) had
a microcircuit planted in his brain to increase his brain power. As a
side effect, he and other cybernauts have wild dreams and, by the time
they are 21, will self-destruct.
</P>
<P>
As might be expected, the show has an energetic music-video
quality. It leans heavily toward the rock 'n' roll set, with quick
edits, harsh angles, hand-held camera work, on-location shooting and a
pulsating soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
Oh, yes, and on the back of the motorcycle Ed has Lisa Dean Ryan as
Doogie Howser never knew her.
</P>
<P>
``Every now and then I get to kiss a girl,'' Noseworthy said
proudly, referring to the former ``Class of '96'' star. He also got to
ride a motorcycle for the show, but, because of a hectic shooting
schedule, is still operating with a restricted license.
</P>
<P>
Noseworthy, 24, has been doing quite well recently. After
appearances in the movies ``Alive'' and ``Encino Man'' and a regular
role on the short-lived CBS show ``Teech,'' he landed a challenging
part as Sissy Spacek's son in the Hallmark Hall of Fame production ``A
Place for Annie.''
</P>
<P>
``I was the only male in the cast, and I got to work with some
really powerful women,'' he said, clicking off the names of Spacek,
Joan Plowright and Mary-Louise Parker. ``It was nice to have a
challenging role where I played a character in the beginning, middle
and end of the movie,'' in which Spacek portrayed a pediatric nurse
who tries to adopt the HIV-positive daughter of an AIDS patient.
</P>
<P>
Then there was the casting for ``Dead at 21.'' Noseworthy, already
selected for the role in part because of his non-glamorous appearance
and look of vulnerability, read with three actresses and was asked for
his recommendation. He picked Ryan. ``I connected with her,'' he said.
``There was a `Taming of the Shrew' type of energy. She's a joy to
work with.''
</P>
<P>
In the premiere the two ride Ed's cycle into the sunset, with the
bad guy lurking somewhere in pursuit. It's part of the paranoid
reality on which the show plays.
</P>
<P>
``When you are young, you don't trust anybody,'' Davola said.
``Everything's a conspiracy. The government is after him; his parents
have deceived him (by not revealing that Ed is adopted). It's `The
Fugitive' meets `Logan's Run.' ''
</P>
<P>
While on the run, and in search of the mad doctor who planted the
time bomb in his head, Ed and Maria journey through familiar night
clubs, shopping malls and coffee houses and try to decipher the clues
contained in his freakish dreams.
</P>
<P>
``MTV is a step ahead of every other network,'' Noseworthy said of
the program, which will have a 13-week run.
</P>
<P>
Davola agreed. ``Dead at 21'' joins the unscripted soap opera
``Real World'' and the dramatic series ``Catwalk'' in the stable of
first-run series as MTV strives to become ``a full-service network.''
</P>
<P>
Before returning to MTV last year, Davola spent five years at Fox,
where he was involved with ``In Living Color,'' ``Totally Hidden
Video,'' ``The Ben Stiller Show,'' ``Code Three'' and ``Sightings.''
</P>
<P>
During that tenure, Davola struck up a friendship with writer Larry
David, who, after repeating ``Joe Davola'' several times at a party,
proclaimed he was going to use the name for a character on
``Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
The Davola character is an obsessed fan who stalks Jerry in several
episodes.

 Grieving Mother Seeks Truth on Tianamen (Beijing) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On that night five years ago this week, high school
sophomore Jiang Jielian decided to go to Tiananmen Square one last
time. There, Beijing's students had camped at the gates of political
power, demanding democracy in the most serious challenge to 40 years
of China's Communist Party rule.
</P>
<P>
On June 3, 1989, Beijing was under martial law. Authorities had
warned residents to stay home. But Jiang, who had marched in peaceful
protests for democracy all spring, was worried about the safety of the
university students still in the square.
</P>
<P>
His mother begged him not to go. She bolted the front door of their
ground-floor apartment. But Jiang came to her, kissed her on the cheek
and said goodbye, using a Chinese phrase that means farewell forever.
He then locked himself in the bathroom and jumped out the window.
</P>
<P>
``I remember saying to him, ``What can you do? You're only a high
school student,' '' his mother recalled, fighting back tears. ``He
said, ``If all parents were as selfish as you, there would be no hope
left for our country.' '' About 30 minutes later, Jiang was shot and
killed by Chinese army soldiers about two miles west of the square.
Like thousands of other civilians who tried to stop the troops as they
advanced from the city outskirts toward the square, he was unarmed.
When soldiers opened fire on the crowd, a bullet hit him in the back
and ripped through his chest. He died on the way to a hospital. He had
turned 17 the day before.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's death launched his mother, Ding Zilin, on a one-woman
campaign to locate the families of those killed and wounded by the
army. Ding, a 57-year-old aesthetics professor, defies government
harassment and contacts the families and distributes to them money
donated from abroad, much of it from Chinese students in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
And underlying this campaign is another cause. ``I don't care how
long it takes,'' she said in a recent interview in her apartment on
the campus of People's University. ``I want the real truth to be
known. I want to know how many were killed by the government.''
</P>
<P>
Does the government know how many were killed?
</P>
<P>
``Of course they know,'' she said. ``But this is their secret.''
</P>
<P>
The Tiananmen Square massacre, which has considerably influenced
the way Chinese and foreigners view China, remains the most
politically taboo subject in the country today.
</P>
<P>
The official version is that the Chinese army was forced to quell a
``counterrevolutionary rebellion'' that night to ensure stability. The
civilians killed were ``counterrevolutionary rebels,'' ``thugs'' or
``rioters,'' authorities have said.
</P>
<P>
But China has refused to give a complete public accounting of the
number of dead and wounded or hold an inquiry into the circumstances
in which unarmed civilians were killed. Ding and other families have
gotten no official compensation for their loss, she said.
</P>
<P>
The government claims that only about 300 died, most of them
soldiers and ``thugs.'' U.S. Embassy officials concluded at the time
that between 500 and 800 Chinese died, while human rights
organizations have said several thousand were killed. Ding's family
gathered evidence -- corpses viewed or accounts from hospital staffers
 -- of 216 dead, and Ding said she believes this represents a fraction
of the total.
</P>
<P>
Ding has located 84 families of those killed and nearly 50 other
families of people seriously injured. She is pursuing leads in 10
other deaths.
</P>
<P>
In a recent petition asking for an official reassessment of the
crackdown, seven dissidents, including former student leader Wang Dan,
said it was time for the government to ``untie the knot in the
people's heart.'' But instead, on this year's fifth anniversary of
Tiananmen, authorities have ordered stepped-up surveillance of
families of those killed in the massacre, Ding said.
</P>
<P>
Ding, a soft-spoken woman, is the prime target. Of the hundreds of
families of victims, only she and her husband, Jiang Peikun, also a
university professor, have dared to acknowledge consistently and
publicly that a family member was killed by the army.
</P>
<P>
Policemen watch the couple's apartment and harass anyone trying to
visit. Ding said police have kept 24-hour surveillance on her since
May 20 -- including following her to the medical clinic where she
receives treatment for heart ailments and a slipped disc.
</P>
<P>
Ding said Sunday by telephone that she had written to the
parliament to say she and her husband will start a two-day hunger
strike Thursday unless their freedom is restored. Writing from her
apartment, where the couple keep their son's ashes in a shrine in the
bedroom, Ding asked, ``Is he not even allowed to have one untainted
space in which his spirit can rest?''
</P>
<P>
``Can his parents not even have a moment of peace to commemorate
the fifth anniversary of his death? We can hardly bear it,'' she
wrote.
</P>
<P>
Ding's campaign has helped reveal how deep is the fear of
Tiananmen's survivors. Families of those killed are afraid to
acknowledge the deaths to neighbors or their work units, she said.
Several have refused to see her or accept her donations, even though
there are no strings attached.
</P>
<P>
Ding went public with her case in 1991 to counter a claim by
Premier Li Peng that families did not want an accounting of the dead
and injured.
</P>
<P>
Because she mourned publicly and challenged the government, Ding
was expelled from the Communist Party and lost her teaching job. Her
husband, 59, was dismissed as director of the university philosophy
department's aesthetics institute. Starting this year, he can no
longer take on new graduate students and his monthly bonus has been
cut.
</P>
<P>
The couple have become pariahs. ``Now old friends we have known for
10 years avoid me and pretend they don't even know me,'' Ding said.
Her neighbor across the hall, an elderly worker, used to be friendly
but now keeps his distance.
</P>
<P>
Each year, on June 3, Ding plays funeral music and burns paper
money in her son's honor. As the date approaches, she said, her dreams
of him often turn to nightmares.
</P>
<P>
Ding knows her work is a growing threat to the government. But she
said she is not afraid. ``What more can they do to me?'' she asked.
``They have already killed my son.''

 `Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle,' Who Knows Cures for Kids, on Showtime 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once there was a marvelous woman named Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle, who
understood children so well that she was able to get naughty children
back on the straight path of growing up.
</P>
<P>
She could get a messy boy to clean up his room. She could persuade
a girl who hated baths to wash. She knew ways to cure a boy who lied.
She could cure a 'fraidy cat and a tattletale and get a child to go to
bed. In short, she was terrific.
</P>
<P>
People who grew up in the 1940s and '50s might remember Betty
MacDonald's character. But not many modern children do. Neither did
Jean Stapleton, who did grow up in the '40s, or the younger Shelley
Duvall, who has a large collection of children's books and makes
award-winning productions for kids.
</P>
<P>
But by their own accounts, they were entranced by MacDonald's
heroine and set about bringing her to life in stories inspired by the
books. Guests include Christopher Lloyd, Ed Begley Jr., Joan Cusack,
Meshach Taylor, Phyllis Diller and James Whitmore, who shows up as Mr.
Piggle-Wiggle (``He was deceased in the books,'' Duvall confided).
</P>
<P>
Executive producer Duvall has also made creative changes in the
stories. ``We contemporized them. There were certain things in the
books that I wanted to bring up to speed.''
</P>
<P>
``Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle,'' Duvall's fifth series for Showtime, begins
Tuesday night with a one-hour parents' preview that includes two
stories: ``The Not Truthful Cure,'' featuring Lloyd as Grandpa
Moohead, who is given to overexaggeration, and his grandson, Egbert,
who fibs; and ``The Pet Forgetters Cure,'' about a girl who forgets to
feed her pets. Begley and Cusack play her parents. Weekly episodes
begin June 14.
</P>
<P>
Duvall and Stapleton talked about the series recently over lunch in
a Washington hotel.
</P>
<P>
Duvall said the publishers of the original ``Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle''
books are considering reissuing the books. If they do, she said she
hopes they hire the original illustrator, Maurice Sendak.
</P>
<P>
Any illustrator who takes a cue from Duvall's color-drenched
televised version will be obliged to dress the character in stripes.
``You can tell a Piggle-Wiggle by their stripes,'' said Duvall, who
plays Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle's daughter Potsi.
</P>
<P>
Stapleton, whose character lives in an upside-down house, has
played in several Duvall series: the fairy godmother in
``Cinderella,'' the ogress in ``Jack in the Beanstalk'' and Mother
Goose in ``Mother Goose Rock 'n' Rhyme.'' A veteran actress, she won
three Emmys for playing Edith Bunker over eight seasons of CBS's ``All
in the Family.''
</P>
<P>
``It's good to be talking about (`Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle') again,
because it was so delightful,'' Stapleton said. ``We don't have a lot
of delightful material on television. I'm beginning to think we're all
going to regress to childhood, because that literature is the most
revealing.''
</P>
<P>
Duvall, whose collection of illustrated children's books numbers
about 3,000, agreed. ``There is some great children's literature out
there. It's an untapped natural resource. We have not explored all the
marvelous children's literature to its full extent. With `Faerie Tale
Theatre,' I did some of that.''
</P>
<P>
It was one of Duvall's staffers, visiting in Seattle, who reported
that a children's theater there was doing a play based on the books,
and that local children were flocking to it.
</P>
<P>
``Kids, from having seen the play, were writing in to the theater
saying, `I have a cure for my older brothers' or whatever,'' said
Duvall. ``And suddenly there were these Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle fan clubs.
So we pursued the rights and got them.''
</P>
<P>
For Duvall, there was only one choice to play the lead: ``Jean: the
perfect Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle. There were no others.''
</P>
<P>
Stapleton snapped up the part. ``If you are a character actress,
`Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle' is a dream. I was in Toronto doing a movie for
Fox, and I had two movie scripts. And here comes this bundle of stuff
from Shelley: three scripts, outlines for others, and the books. As
soon as I read them, I said, `This is it. I'd rather do this than the
films.' It's the quality of writing that drew me, the literacy and the
wit.''
</P>
<P>
``Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle'' was co-produced with Universal Family
Entertainment and New Zealand's South Pacific Pictures. The cast and
crew went to New Zealand to make the 13 shows in 10 weeks, working
12-hour days for six-day weeks. Stapleton, Duvall said, was
``indefatigable.''

 Newsstand Owner Hawks One View of the Windy City (Chicago) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richard Graff is every municipal bureaucrat's nightmare.
Eccentric and excitable, he bounded back and forth in front of his
downtown newsstand here the other day while providing a
stream-of-consciousness commentary on the evils of the local
government.
</P>
<P>
Arrayed on the newsstand racks behind him were thousands of comic
books and a smaller collection of adult magazines tucked into a
discreet corner, but no newspapers. Rick's Newsstand, as it is known,
does not sell newspapers, a fact that its proprietor blames on his
long-running feud with the city.
</P>
<P>
``It's degrading to me,'' Graff said. ``I'm the Michael Jordan of
newsstands. I'm the best.''
</P>
<P>
To city officials, however, Graff bears no resemblance to Jordan,
the Chicago Bulls' former superstar. To them he is a nuisance and his
newsstand is an eyesore, blighting the sidewalk area near an entrance
to the Chicago Cultural Center, a graceful, 19th century building that
is an official Chicago landmark.
</P>
<P>
Graff and the city have been battling on and off for years. Earlier
this month, their dispute reached the Supreme Court, which refused to
consider Graff's appeal of a 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
decision upholding the city's right to order Graff to move the
newsstand to a new location or dismantle it.
</P>
<P>
For Graff, June 6 is indeed D-Day, the deadline for him to leave
the location where he has operated since 1984 and where a newsstand
has existed for more than 70 years.
</P>
<P>
The legal battle centered on Graff's assertion that a 1991 city
ordinance regulating the size and location of newsstands and limiting
their number is an unconstitutional infringement on the dissemination
of information. But his cause, according to sympathizers, also
involves a larger struggle between those who want to preserve such
colorful, gritty reminders of Chicago history and the forces of
sterile gentrification who would turn the city into a sanitized theme
park, a sort of Daleyland by the Lake.
</P>
<P>
The chief villain, to Graff and his supporters, is Mayor Richard M.
Daley, D, who also has pushed for the dismantling of another grubby
Chicago institution -- the ramshackle Maxwell Street Market where
street vendors have hawked their wares for more than 100 years -- and
whose vision of the city's future focuses on a plan to create a
``family entertainment center'' theme park built around several
riverboat gambling casinos.
</P>
<P>
Even Daley's recent decision to abandon his family's ancestral
home, the working-class neighborhood of Bridgeport, for an upscale
development south of the central business district has been linked by
critics to what they call his obsession with tidiness.
</P>
<P>
``It's kind of like the Disneylandization of America,'' said
Jonathan A. Rothstein, one of Graff's lawyers. ``That attracts
tourists, I suppose, and it's good for the economy, but do you want to
live on Disneyland's Main Street? It's not real.''
</P>
<P>
To Rothstein and others, the newsstand is ``as much a landmark as
the building'' and Graff is part of the vitality and color of the
downtown city streets. He is certainly colorful. Dressed in a black
Marvel Comics jacket, he chatted the other day with regular customers
who browsed through the comic books, including a man who identified
himself as a lawyer for the city government.
</P>
<P>
``How do you feel about the newsstand?'' Graff demanded to know.
</P>
<P>
``Bad,'' the lawyer replied sheepishly.
</P>
<P>
To amuse pedestrians who rush by, Graff sometimes outfits his
Alaskan malamute, Tasha, with sunglasses and watches the reaction.
``See, I just made two people smile,'' he said proudly as two women
paused and laughed at the dog.
</P>
<P>
``That is why I should be here,'' Graff added. ``For the flavor of
the city. It's not just a newsstand.'' Graff said he paid $50,000 in
1984 for the newsstand and prime location a few feet from the entrance
to a commuter train station and busy Michigan Avenue. But he has never
had a city permit to run the stand. Denied a permit, he filed suit in
1991 challenging the existing ordinance that restricted newspaper
sales to publications printed in Chicago, a widely ignored provision.
Rather than defend the ordinance in court, the city enacted a new law
later that year.
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Rosenthal, deputy corporation counsel for the city, argued
that the new ordinance cleaned up a loosely regulated system that was
rife with another Chicago tradition -- the opportunity for corruption.
``If you were pals with someone in City Hall, you got to run a
newsstand,'' he said. ``Graff's predecessor evidently had some kind of
a handshake agreement with someone. But that's the worst way to
protect First Amendment rights.''
</P>
<P>
Under the new permit ordinance, Rosenthal said, newsstand vendors
are protected ``even if they offend the local alderman. They have
rights now.'' He said this includes Graff, who has rejected offers to
operate a smaller newsstand at a less desirable downtown location.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the larger debate over whether there is room for places
like Rick's Newsstand and the Maxwell Street Market in the city's
future continues to rage. Gerald W. Ropka, a geography professor at
DePaul University, said he sympathized with Daley's efforts to clean
up the downtown area rather than risk the slow strangulation by
suburban shopping malls that has occurred in cities like Detroit.
</P>
<P>
But political scientist Larry Bennett, Ropka's colleague on the
DePaul faculty, said he has misgivings about grandiose plans to
transform a historically messy melting pot into ``a very tidy city.''
</P>
<P>
``The problem will be when Chicago becomes insufficiently
distinctive from other cities so that it no longer has its own
identity,'' he said.

 Aviation Realizes That Cockpit, Cabin Crews Need to Work Together
Better 
Aviation Comes to Realize that Crew-Atten By Don Phillips 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the 1930s, flight attendants were called ``skygirls.'' They were
to be single, under age 25, less than 115 pounds, act like a
``well-trained servant.'' An airline manual of that era instructed
skygirls to ``treat captains and pilots with strict formality while in
uniform. A rigid military salute will be rendered as they go aboard
and deplane.''
</P>
<P>
Times are different now, but the aviation community is gradually
coming to realize that some of the old attitudes hang on in modern
jetliners -- and that can be dangerous. Research has shown that there
is a greater gap between pilots and attendants than just the cockpit
door, and in rare instances it has killed.
</P>
<P>
A report published by the Flight Safety Foundation said that pilots
and attendants sometimes show animosity toward one another, are often
confused as to when to communicate problems, have little awareness of
the other's duties in an emergency and sometimes don't even introduce
themselves prior to a flight.
</P>
<P>
These problems do not exist with every airline crew, and only
rarely lead to a safety problem, but the report's authors, Rebecca D.
Chute of San Jose State University and Earl L. Wiener of the
University of Miami, gave two examples when they did:
</P>
<P>
-- In 1989, 24 people were killed in an Air Ontario crash on takeoff
from Dryden, Ontario, because of ice on the wings. Flight attendants
saw wet snow on the wings, but did not tell the pilots because they
assumed they knew and were reluctant to ``second-guess the pilots.''
</P>
<P>
-- Before a disastrous British Midlands fire in 1989, the captain
reported over the public address system that he had a problem with the
right engine. Although the attendants and passengers could see fire in
the left engine, they did nothing as the pilot shut down the wrong
engine.
</P>
<P>
``Although cabin and flight deck crews share the same goals, the
two crews have evolved into two distinct cultures, resulting in
communication and coordination problems between them,'' the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Clay Foushee, Northwest Airlines vice president for flight
operations, said he is well aware of the problem, and Northwest ``is
moving very quickly toward doing some joint training and crew resource
management'' between pilots and attendants.
</P>
<P>
Crew resource management -- or CRM -- is the aviation buzzword for
teaching pilots to communicate and not to intimidate subordinates,
problems blamed for several crashes in the 1980s. CRM for pilots and
flight attendants is a fairly new concept, and is endorsed by the
Chute-Wiener report. ``Data suggest that CRM training could bring
these two disparate cultures into greater cohesion,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
John O'Brien, director of engineering and air safety for the Air
Line Pilots Association, said the association has been pursuing joint
training and CRM as a goal since 1986.
</P>
<P>
He said pilots can encourage the flow of information by such simple
practices as saying thank you for information, even if it isn't
needed. Flight attendants may withhold vital information if ``the
flight deck responds by jumping down someone's throat.''
</P>
<P>
Nancy Gilmer, chairman of the Association of Flight Attendants'
safety committee, said flight attendants are trained to inform pilots
of possible problems, but ``it hasn't been stressed in training.''
</P>
<P>
The report said a major source of confusion is the Federal Aviation
Administration's ``sterile cockpit'' rule, which says that crew
members should strictly stick to their duties during ``a critical
phase of flight.'' Generally, this is interpreted to mean any
operations below 10,000 feet. It bans ``nonessential communications
between the cabin and cockpit crews.''
</P>
<P>
One of the greatest problems the study identified is airline
corporate structure. Pilots report to the flight operations
department, where safety is the major concern, while attendants
usually report to the marketing department, where service is the main
concern.
</P>
<P>
Another problem is that cockpit and cabin crews no longer serve as
a team for long periods. Attendants may work for as many as five
cockpit crews in one day.

 Fox's Frightening Friday Series 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stay home Friday nights this summer and see the first-season
replays of Fox's ``The X-Files'' that you probably missed.
</P>
<P>
The series debuted to little fanfare in September but finished a
strong first season in May -- so strong it has become one of those
shows with a so-called ``cult following.''
</P>
<P>
``Each week we set out to scare the pants off people,'' said
creator, writer and producer Chris Carter. ``We try to do it in a
number of ways, but we have found that some of our most effective
episodes have been dark ones, in both psychological content and the
look of the show.
</P>
<P>
``I think that there is a general mood to `The X Files,' although
each of them (episodes) have their own dark sensibility.''
</P>
<P>
Fox's frightening Friday series is slated to return next fall. A
blend of science and the supernatural, the series focuses on two smart
FBI special agents whose relationship is based on mutual respect and
intellectual attraction.
</P>
<P>
Gillian Anderson, 25, plays the stoic Dana Scully, recruited by the
FBI out of medical school. David Duchovny, 33, is Fox ``Spooky''
Mulder, the scientist who studies serial killers and is willing to
suspend credibility to get to the truth, which, as the show's mantra
phrases it, ``is out there.''
</P>
<P>
Nothing odd or unusual is off limits to Scully and Mulder's
caseload, be they mediums, psychic phenomena, UFOs, mutating humans,
firestarters or the Jersey Devil.
</P>
<P>
This week's episode is a particularly gruesome one called ``The
Squeeze,'' about a man who can live indefinitely, shifting his shape,
as long as his diet includes the livers of freshly killed humans.
</P>
<P>
The eeriest part of ``The X-Files'' may be knowing that the plots
are based on factual reports. The May 13 season finale tied in the
newsmaking case of a California cancer victim whose dying body emitted
fumes that overcame an emergency-room staff.
</P>
<P>
``Many of our ideas spring from actual accounts, essays, pieces in
journals that we expand by positing `what if,' '' Carter said. He said
he forages for ideas from news reports but has been particularly
influenced by Harvard professor John Mack's 1991 Roper Survey
describing UFO abductions. (Mack has estimated that 3.7 million
Americans may have been abducted by UFOs.)
</P>
<P>
``That was part of my original inspiration,'' he said. The fact
that alien phenomena was being taken seriously, studied scientifically
by a man who works at Harvard, ``gave it a legitimacy. I thought that
that gave me some heavy ammunition with which to set out.''
</P>
<P>
Yet Carter himself sounds as if his feet are firmly planted on the
earth. ``I would not call myself a New-Ager,'' he said, although many
of his fans may be.
</P>
<P>
``My brother is a Ph.D. -- he's a physicist,'' he said. ``He became
the scientist of the family. But I think that there's a big part of me
that is interested in what he does.''
</P>
<P>
The show, shot in Vancouver, B.C., has a burgeoning following,
including a fan club based in New Hampshire and heavy traffic on the
Internet computer network. Carter's assistant prints out messages for
him -- ``instant feedback,'' he called it.
</P>
<P>
Carter acknowledged that he listens to fan reaction to the episodes
but pays little attention to suggestions for stories. ``We have a very
clear vision of the show and what we want to do,'' he said. That means
no plans for romance between Scully and Mulder.
</P>
<P>
``Everyone thought that there would be a lot of weirdos coming out
of the woodwork,'' said Carter. ``We've had a few, but mostly we've
had people who have enjoyed the show because they think the stories
are well told.''
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the show appeals because it challenges our set notions, as
did Rod Serling's ``The Twilight Zone.''
</P>
<P>
But what is the goal of the show? To scare, amaze, mystify or
simply raise a lot of pertinent questions?
</P>
<P>
``All of the above,'' said Carter. ``I think that comparison (with
`The Twilight Zone') only goes so far. Those shows became allegories.
I think that each episode did not explore a bigger theme. ... We set
out to find something, a subject, and we twist it, and we try to make
it take place in the realm of extreme possibility. And that's where
the biggest scare comes from.''
</P>
<P>
The show's title refers to secret government files on the
paranormal. Files starting with an `X' fall into the
unexplainable/paranormal category, presumably stored in a clandestine
vault beneath the Pentagon. The series has the government trying to
conceal many unusual occurrences.

 Fewer Internships on Capitol Hill (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There may be a few less young interns working on
Capitol Hill this summer: A congressional internship program that
would support nearly 300 summer interns has been suspended by the
House as part of an effort to cut staff.
</P>
<P>
Members of Congress were notified May 16 that the Lyndon Baines
Johnson internship, which has made it possible for congressional
offices to hire a two-month intern each year since 1974, will not
authorize funding for any more interns this year.
</P>
<P>
While the funding cut poses problems for those congressional
offices that have already committed to summer interns, it is unlikely
to thwart the plans of those students. Hill offices say they will find
savings in other areas to pay the interns.
</P>
<P>
``We'll just look within our own budget and find a way to cut it.
Maybe there's a magazine subscription we don't need, maybe we can look
at those small things that add up,'' said Mary Fetsch of the office of
Rep. Elizabeth Furse, D-Ore..
</P>
<P>
The LBJ intern will be the only intern on Furse's staff this
summer. Other offices have multiple interns, including those from
university-sponsored programs, volunteers from members' districts, or
paid interns from the office's personnel budget.
</P>
<P>
``It will take out one of our paid internships,'' said Charlie
Boesel, an aide to Rep. Thomas J. Bliley Jr, R-Va. ``Four six-week
internships that Bliley pays for out of his own annual staff
appropriations won't be affected.'' In addition, Bliley's office often
takes advantage of an unpaid internship program American University
offers.
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of the funding cut, Rep. James P. Moran Jr., D-Va.,
did not hire an LBJ intern for this summer. In contrast, Rep. Scotty
Baesler, D-Ky., will have two one-month LBJ interns -- one who started
May 1 and one who starts June 1 -- who will now have to be paid out of
the office's personnel budget.
</P>
<P>
Because each office has a different combination of available funds
for personnel, office space and starting dates for intern hiring, the
LBJ cut will affect some members more than others.
</P>
<P>
Congress is trying to match a 4 percent staff cut in the executive
branch over the next two fiscal years.

 The Financial Markets Aren't Crazy 
 Shelton is a senior research fellow at the Hoover 
 Institution at Stanford University. 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Federal Reserve Board decides to raise interest rates by a
hefty one-half percent -- and Wall Street cheers? Either financial
markets are truly perverse, as some at the White House have suggested,
or something else is going on. And it isn't inflation.
</P>
<P>
The United States under the Clinton administration is locked on a
collision course between its desired domestic economic agenda and the
demands of the international financial community. President Clinton
has set great store on his ability to deliver low interest rates as
the result of prudent budget decisions. While administration officials
early on dismissed the stock market as a credible judge of their
economic program (``It goes up, it goes down''), they have pointed to
the low 30-year Treasury bond rate with pride and satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
But since that benchmark rate started climbing precipitously this
year -- it reached as high as 7.60 percent on May 11, compared with
5.78 on Oct. 14 -- the White House has been scrambling to explain to
the American people what has changed. As it turns out, the U.S.
domestic economic scene hasn't changed much in the past seven months,
except for the better: Employment is up, inflation is down. What has
been driving interest yields higher is the insistence by foreign
investors that they be compensated for the impact of a falling dollar.
</P>
<P>
Ever since Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen uttered ``I'd like to
see a stronger yen'' at the National Press Club a month after
Clinton's inauguration, the value of the dollar has been up for grabs
in international currency markets. Clinton himself compounded the
jawboning factor last spring, when he announced at a joint press
conference with Japan's visiting prime minister that the weak dollar
was ``number one'' on a list of the ``things working today which may
give us more results'' in shrinking the U.S. trade deficit with Japan.
</P>
<P>
Global currency traders took notice. If officials in the White
House wanted to see the dollar go down against the yen, they would be
only too happy to accommodate them. Within four months, the dollar
would hit post-World War II record lows approaching 100 yen to the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
Still, bond yields seemed relatively unaffected by the sagging
dollar until early this year. Then, suddenly, the dollar began losing
value against the German mark also. Now global investors were
demanding higher interest rates to offset the projected exchange rate
loss from investing in dollar-denominated financial instruments.
</P>
<P>
By late April, officials at Treasury and the White House were
alarmed by the backwash effect of a weak dollar on U.S. bond yields. A
massive intervention effort carried out by the Fed in conjunction with
the central banks of 15 other nations on May 4 gave currency
speculators temporary pause as they weighed the willingness of foreign
governments to endlessly shell out reserves to buy dollars. But U.S.
bond yields continued to soar. A surprise move on May 11 by the
Bundesbank to dramatically cut German interest rates tipped the
currency scale in favor of the dollar. Still, investors were waiting
for the other shoe to drop. Two weeks ago, with a Fed hike of 50 basis
points in both the discount rate and the federal funds rate, it did.
</P>
<P>
So even as sharply rising interest rates are spooking average
Americans and undermining the fundamental assumptions of Clinton's
domestic economic program, the international financial markets are
merely pacified for the present. Wall Street's seeming approval of the
jump two weeks ago in key interest rates is a reflection of that. It
does not mean U.S. business is eager to embrace a higher cost of
capital or that consumers are ready to absorb higher borrowing costs.
</P>
<P>
Are financial markets irrational, superstitious? To the contrary.
They are not prone to inflation myths, as Laura D'Andrea Tyson,
chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, would have
us believe. They are registering their legitimate response to the
Clinton administration's demonstrated willingness to let the dollar
slide to achieve perceived gains in foreign trade. What is perverse is
to proclaim a commitment to a strong dollar, as Clinton did in
December 1992 (when it took 124 yen to buy a dollar), and then expect
investors to passively absorb exchange rate losses as the White House
talks down the value of America's currency.

 Old Arlington Markers Turn Up in Yards (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The white stone blocks used in some patios, driveways
and walkways in the Washington area have names and dates engraved on
one side.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of weathered and damaged burial markers from graves at
Arlington National Cemetery have been discarded over the years, and
many of them apparently were scavenged from landfills and used for
home projects, cemetery officials said.
</P>
<P>
They are sometimes discovered after a home changes hands, and
startled homeowners contact the cemetery.
</P>
<P>
``We get these calls all the time,'' said Herman Higgenbottom,
deputy superintendent of the cemetery. ``It's not unusual for someone
to buy a house in Washington and find one in the yard or the basement,
and then they call us up. Years ago, people used to steal them from
the dump and build patios with them.''
</P>
<P>
Higgenbottom, an employee of the cemetery for 29 years, said he
understood the distress of the callers. ``I'd be upset too if I found
cemetery markers around my house.''
</P>
<P>
Arlington gravestones are replaced at a rate of about 100 a month,
a spokeswoman said. The markers used to be left intact at a landfill.
In 1987, the cemetery began pulverizing discarded gravestones, the
spokeswoman said, in part because of calls from those who found the
markers that had been discarded in earlier years.
</P>
<P>
Arlington National Cemetery is the best known of the country's more
than 100 military cemeteries. More than 225,000 service veterans and
family members are buried on the 612 acres of former farmland.
According to literature supplied by the cemetery, about 18 burials are
conducted there each weekday.
</P>
<P>
More than 160 of the stones, turned face down, were made into a
patio behind a Northeast Washington apartment building. In the
basement were three more of the large, group markers inscribed with
the names of 19 men who died in World War II.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam-era veteran Ed Siemion, who was hired to repair one of the
four apartments in the building, discovered the stones and showed them
to a reporter last week.
</P>
<P>
``It gave me chills when I saw them,'' Siemion said.

 Cheap Gas Boosting Travel, Car Sales -- and Pollution 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Holiday drivers who pulled into service stations across the nation
last weekend were taking advantage of one of the country's great
bargains: gasoline has never been cheaper than it has been this year,
compared with what people pay for other goods and services. Encouraged
by the low cost of fuel, Americans have been buying more and more cars
and light trucks -- a category that includes most minivans -- and
driving them farther.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the American Automobile Association estimated before
the holiday that 25 million people used a car, light truck or
recreational vehicle to drive more than 100 miles from home this
weekend, while another 3.5 million traveled that distance by airplane,
train or bus.
</P>
<P>
``The major reasons for the . . . record number of holiday
travelers include an improved economy, low gasoline prices, stable
lodging and meal costs and airfare discounts,'' said AAA Potomac.
</P>
<P>
The low cost of the kerosene type jet fuel most commercial
airliners use is one reason so many airlines are offering discounted
fares. Actual jet fuel prices this year are about half what they were
in 1981, and compared with prices of other industrial products, they
are down much more than that.
</P>
<P>
However, it's not just travel that's affected by low fuel prices.
Experts say one reason that sales have been booming for pickup trucks,
minivans and four-wheel-drive vehicles -- which generally are less fuel
efficient than most cars -- is that fuel cost is not a deterrent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, low fuel costs are having a major impact on air
pollution, particularly in urban areas, according to a number of
analysts. The most important point is simply that people are driving
more miles.
</P>
<P>
``Since 1970 vehicle miles traveled have increased by 69 percent,
partially offsetting reductions in emissions per mile brought about by
new-car emissions standards,'' recently wrote Winston Harrington and
Margaret A. Walls, analysts at Resources for the Future, a Washington
environmental research organization.
</P>
<P>
Harrington and Walls also note that the average age of the U.S.
fleet of vehicles has gone up substantially, compounding the problem.
``Emissions control systems tend to break down as cars get older,
causing emissions to rise,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
While it may be that the newer generation of cars and light trucks
are more durable than their predecessors, low fuel costs also have
encouraged many owners of older, less fuel efficient vehicles to keep
them on the road longer.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts have suggested that a cost-effective way to reduce
emissions is to have a public agency buy and scrap such cars to
upgrade the average level of emissions control effectiveness. Several
other pollution control strategies could directly affect the price of
gasoline, at least initially.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the Environmental Protection Agency has suggested
that reformulating the cocktail of refined petroleum products that
make up a gallon of gasoline could reduce certain emissions in a
cost-effective way while adding about 3 cents a gallon to the cost of
making the fuel. Reformulating the mix to allow vehicles to meet
stringent targets set by the state of California would cost an added 8
cents to 11 cents a gallon. But even if such an approach were taken,
the average motorist might well not end up paying that much. There are
two concrete examples to the contrary: lead and taxes.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of air pollution control laws passed in the 1970s
and tightened later, gasoline refiners were required to phase out the
use of tetraethyl lead, an additive that effectively upgraded the
quality of the fuel. However, part of the additive came out the tail
pipe along with the other emissions and added significantly to the
amount of lead in the air, especially in congested areas. Lead is a
metal that when taken into the body can cause severe health problems,
including permanent reduction in mental capacity in children.
</P>
<P>
At the time, there were complaints from the oil industry that if
the use of tetraethyl lead was stopped, more expensive parts of a
refined barrel of crude oil would have to be used in its place to
provide satisfactory performance in most cars. Almost all of the
gasoline produced in the United States today is lead-free, and even if
it costs more to make than if tetraethyl lead were still in use, the
added expense has not been enough to increase the inflation-adjusted
price of gasoline at the pump.
</P>
<P>
Neither have the steady increases in taxes levied on fuel by
federal, state and some local governments. Last Oct. 1, for example,
the federal government raised its motor fuel tax by 4.3 cents a gallon
as part of the package of measures to reduce prospective federal
budget deficits. During the debate over the legislation, some
lawmakers and environmentalists argued for a much larger increase in
the tax both to generate more revenue and to discourage gasoline
consumption. In September, the average, seasonally adjusted pump price
for unleaded regular gasoline across the nation was $1.085 a gallon,
according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The next month, with the
higher tax in effect, the price jumped to $1.127. By January, despite
the tax, it was back down to $1.043 and in April, the latest figure
available, it stood at $1.064.
</P>
<P>
While all those forces have been pushing up the cost of gasoline,
other forces have been holding it down. The most significant, of
course, is the world price of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
Another reality of the marketplace is that the average fuel
efficiency of the U.S. fleet of vehicles has gone up enough that,
despite all the added miles being driven on Memorial Day weekends and
the rest of the year, the nation's total consumption of gasoline is no
higher now than it was in the late 1970s.

 Clinton Hopes `Political Business Cycle' Will Carry Him to Reelection 
 (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Clinton has taken pains to avoid a public
quarrel with the Federal Reserve over its decision to increase
short-term interest rates, but, privately, he has railed against the
moves. And, according to Clinton administration officials, he has sent
staff scrambling to provide him with the latest details about where
the economy -- and with it his political fortunes -- are headed.
</P>
<P>
White House deputy economic adviser Gene Sperling can tick off key
economic data almost to the minute. He can tell you, for example, that
on Friday the economy is likely to create its three-millionth job
since Clinton took the oath of office.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, White House aides have consulted a number of
outside experts on the dynamics of the ``political business cycle.''
</P>
<P>
Among them: Yale University economist Ray Fair, architect of the
nation's most sophisticated model for predicting presidential election
outcomes based on the performance of the economy. The only
presidential contest Fair has called wrong was Clinton's victory over
President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
And serving on the White House staff this year is Robert F.
Wescott, an economist whose ``pocketbook index'' for predicting the
outcome of presidential elections suggests that if the after-tax
income of U.S. families is rising at a 3.7 percent annual rate or more
in the fall of 1995, odds are that Clinton will win re-election. The
rate this spring: 3.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
This constant monitoring of the economy's pulse highlights one of
the most fundamental characteristics of the Clinton White House: It
remains exquisitely sensitive to the link between its political future
and the health of the economy. Indeed, the rallying call for Clinton's
1996 campaign may well be, ``It's still the economy, stupid.''
</P>
<P>
``The president is very focused on the economy,'' said Sperling.
``He has been sending very strong signals down the chain of command
that even while we are working on crime, health care and other things,
the economy should always be front and center.''
</P>
<P>
At the close of his first year in office, the waves of economic
growth seemed to be breaking just right for Clinton: The jobless rate
was falling, there was hardly a trace of inflation, interest rates had
receded and the stock market was soaring. With economists predicting
solid growth rates into 1996 election year, it seemed Clinton would be
able to surf the business cycle right through to a second term.
</P>
<P>
But the economic tides have shifted in recent months. As the Fed
has raised interest rates, the value of the dollar faltered overseas
and financial markets behaved erratically. Many private economists
believe the business cycle continues to move in sync with the
political calendar. But the developments of the past three months seem
to have shaken Clinton's confidence.
</P>
<P>
Robert E. Rubin, Clinton's national economic adviser, is counseling
colleagues to stay the course. Rubin, a former Wall Street executive,
likens their current anxiety to that of a white-knuckled trader
sitting with a billion-dollar block of Treasury bonds during a
unexpected dip in the market. If you believe your original analysis
was right and the economic fundamentals have not changed, he argues,
there is no reason to panic or modify your strategy.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the administration's current forecast for the economy has
changed little from the one it fashioned in the first few days of the
administration, a projection known inside the White House as the
``pizza forecast.''
</P>
<P>
Those calculations were made by the members of ``T-2,'' a troika of
economic deputies-Alan S. Blinder, a member of the Council of Economic
Advisers; Alicia H. Munnell, assistant Treasury secretary; and Joseph
J. Minarik, associate director of the Office of Management and Budget.
</P>
<P>
Over carry-out pizzas in Blinder's quarters in the Old Executive
Office Building one night shortly after the inauguration, they
estimated that the economy's growth rate cycle eventually would reach
3.3 percent in 1994 before settling down to a comfortable
noninflationary growth rate of 2.5 percent in 1996 and the years
beyond.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Economic Advisers is now revising that forecast, but
expects little change. The preliminary consensus is that the economic
drag from the recent rise of interest rates will be more than offset
by the stimulative effects of record-high spending on new business
equipment.
</P>
<P>
As companies invest in new technology and re-engineer the way they
do business, many administration economists believe, workers will be
able to produce more goods and services, generating higher incomes
without generating inflation.
</P>
<P>
The bottom line: Economic growth will remain steady, but not so
strong as to make Clinton's reelection a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
Many private economists share the administration's cautious
optimism. In fact, some say that recent developments have only
improved the president's political prospects.
</P>
<P>
By raising interest rates, they argue, the Fed and Wall Street's
bond traders might have slowed the growth of the economy this year or
next, but helped to ensure that the expansion would not peter out by
1996.
</P>
<P>
``If anything, I think the Fed has done Clinton a favor,'' said
Lehman Brothers Inc. economist Allen Sinai, whose latest newsletter to
clients said the administration stands posed to ``beat the business
cycle'' this time around. ``This is looking more and more like it will
be a long-lasting business expansion.''

 Developer Envisions New City on Whitewater Land 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now we know why the Clintons bombed in their Whitewater real estate
venture. It was, says Jack Trinsey, Pennsylvania developer, politician
and legal gadfly, a failure of vision. They bought only half the
mountain. They should have bought the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
Behold, the Trail of Tears Tower, a 115-story,
tallest-building-in-the-world monolith that Trinsey says is the true
destiny for the 240 acres of mountain land the Clintons bought 15
years ago with their then-friends and future S L barons, James and
Susan McDougal.
</P>
<P>
In what would surely rank as one of the world's great silk purse
transformations, Trinsey says he wants to build the tower on a bend in
the scenic White River in northern Arkansas. The name would honor the
Native Americans who passed through the area on a forced march to
Oklahoma in the late 1830s. The project also would be carried out,
Trinsey said, in memory of the spunk of the ``young Clintons.''
</P>
<P>
To that end, he's planning to keep Hillary Rodham Clinton's puny
$30,000 model home as a Lincolnesque tribute to the First Family's
``noble'' -- if unsuccessful -- efforts ``to bring this magnificent
Whitewater site to the public.'' He wants to use a cuddly black
``Hillary Bear'' as the project's mascot.
</P>
<P>
``I saw an aerial view of the Whitewater project and I said, ``Oh
my goodness . . . I have got to have that,' '' Trinsey said. ``I
understand why the young Clintons fell in love with it and I
understand why they failed. . . . They bought only half of their hill.
</P>
<P>
``They just could not cut the mustard. When you see the sample
(home) that the young Hillary Rodham put in you understand that she
did all the suffering any developer in the country does. There is just
heartache there.''
</P>
<P>
All told, Trinsey's project would be 5 million square feet (the
Pentagon clocks in at 3.75 million) of sparkling glass office space.
</P>
<P>
In Flippin, Ark.
</P>
<P>
``It appears to me he is probably a crackpot because in my wildest
imagination I cannot imagine the thing he is talking about being built
in this area,'' said Flippin Mayor Bob Marberry.
</P>
<P>
The roads are bad and the area remote, and there certainly is no
demand at present for a 1,500-foot office tower in the Flippin area,
or even Cotter -- the other town near Whitewater. There may not be for
another millennium. The tallest building in Flippin currently is two
stories, and the largest industry a factory that turns out a couple
dozen bass boats each day. What's more, the people there don't want
such an obvious urban intrusion -- even a dozen miles away at
Whitewater.
</P>
<P>
``When you get to Flippin you think you have gone to the end of the
world,'' Marberry said. ``When you go on to Whitewater you know you
are at the end of the world.''
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Trinsey, aided by brokers at local Pioneer Realty,
has for nominal sums bought purchase options on about 10 of
Whitewater's 44 lots, and on another 80 acres across the road. The
real estate agents involved say they are earnest about helping Trinsey
assemble up to 1,000 acres, in hopes he can get at least a limited
project off the ground.
</P>
<P>
Trinsey, in fact, says he will start slow.
</P>
<P>
``The question is, can we start new life here?'' Trinsey said. ``I
am doing exactly what the Good Witch Glinda advised Dorothy to do in
her quest to find the Wizard of Oz. It is always best to start at the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
So first he will build the four-story ``Whitewater Inn.'' Then he
will expand with the construction of six-, 10-, 20-story and larger
structures, before going public with a stock offering to raise the
money for the Trail of Tears Tower.
</P>
<P>
There will also be a Whitewater soap opera, and movie, he says, all
about young entrepreneurs trying to get a leg up-just as Bill and
Hillary tried to do when they went halfsies with the McDougals on
Whitewater, and when they practiced the politics of meaning on the
commodities exchange.
</P>
<P>
``The advertising we are going to have all across the world is,
``Live, work and worship at Whitewater,' '' Trinsey said. ``I am
seeking to get blessings from the Indian nation. . . . I am going to
invite the entire nation of tribes to a public picnic'' to
authenticate the project's roots.
</P>
<P>
Consider him the Romulus and Remus of the Ozarks. More modestly he
refers to himself as the ``Beethoven'' of developers, and says
Whitewater's remoteness is part of the attraction for him. It's a
chance to paint on a clean canvas.
</P>
<P>
He could use it.
</P>
<P>
The central project of Trinsey's life, incomplete after 30 years,
was taken away from him and auctioned by the Resolution Trust Corp. in
1992. Trinsey acquired the land for his Rebel Hill development, near
Philadelphia, in 1959, and did manage to build a few town houses
before facing foreclosure on a $7 million loan.
</P>
<P>
Trinsey, 66, is still fighting the RTC in court over that project,
which offers another important glimpse of Trinsey's character.
</P>
<P>
He likes to sue people.
</P>
<P>
Over the last few years he has -- typically acting without a lawyer
 -- sued the Democratic and Republican parties, Ross Perot's
organization, and all 50 states. The lawsuits were related to his
various political campaigns-for U.S. Senate, president (he got 22
votes in New Hampshire) and an upcoming bid for governor of
Pennsylvania. He is also planning to sue Supreme Court Justice Byron
White for refusing to allow an appeal of one of his other lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
It was, in fact, in fighting the RTC that he first learned about
Whitewater.
</P>
<P>
He saw in special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr.'s investigation of
the development an opportune chance to correct his own misfortune with
Rebel Hill.
</P>
<P>
The answer was obvious.
</P>
<P>
Sue Fiske!
</P>
<P>
A motion trying to force Fiske to include in his probe an extensive
look at RTC wrongdoing is pending in U.S. District Court in Washington
at this moment.
</P>
<P>
Immersed in Whitewater as a result, he saw published pictures, then
followed up with a visit in April.
</P>
<P>
Herewith, his reaction:
</P>
<P>
``My eyes slowly left the bottom of the White River to the ground
below my feet and suddenly I felt a presence of those Indians on those
very grounds and then my eyes caught the base of the trees lining the
river bank and my eyes lifted slowly up the trees to the sky above
when I saw a vision of a Trail of Tears Tower rising to the sky, the
tallest building in the world.
</P>

``I have not been the same since.''

 Documents Hint at More Help by Mrs. Clinton for S L Owner (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How much did Hillary Rodham Clinton know in the early
and mid-1980s about the troubled business dealings of her Whitewater
partner and sometime law client, James B. McDougal? And did she play a
role in his efforts to bail himself out?
</P>
<P>
These questions have become an important part of the Whitewater
controversy facing the president and Mrs. Clinton. And in the
incremental way that the affair is now developing, new documents have
surfaced that don't fit comfortably with Mrs. Clinton's explanation
that her contacts as an attorney with McDougal and his Arkansas
savings and loan company were purely routine and peripheral.
</P>
<P>
The Clintons contend they were remote from the tangled financial
affairs of Madison Guaranty Savings Loan, owned by McDougal, their
partner in the Whitewater real estate development. The thrift was
seized by federal regulators in 1989 at a cost to taxpayers of $47
million.
</P>
<P>
As a partner in the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Ark., Mrs.
Clinton represented McDougal's S L in 1985 before the state securities
commissioner (appointed by her husband, then the governor) on a plan
that would allow the thrift to sell preferred stock to boost its
capital reserves and meet federal regulators' demands. At a press
conference in April, Mrs. Clinton said she acted only as the ``billing
attorney,'' while the case was actually handled at the firm by a
junior associate.
</P>
<P>
But documents obtained by the Resolution Trust Corp. suggest that
Mrs. Clinton's efforts on McDougal's behalf were both more active and
more longstanding than that.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, the documents show, Mrs. Clinton took a role in mediating
a dispute between McDougal and the Rose firm over fees from earlier
legal work. McDougal had refused to pay Rose's bills, prompting the
firm's managing partner, Joseph Giroir, to declare that he did not
want McDougal as a Rose client again in the future, according to
partners at the firm.
</P>
<P>
But Mrs. Clinton interceded, and documents and interviews with
participants suggest that her mediation may have made possible the
subsequent Rose efforts on behalf of the S L.
</P>
<P>
In an Oct. 10, 1983, letter obtained by the RTC, Giroir wrote
McDougal that he was submitting a new bill ``pursuant to your
discussions with Hillary Rodham Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
While the savings and loan matter was pending before the state
commission, McDougal indicated an interest in ways Mrs. Clinton could
help with Madison's dealings with the state.
</P>
<P>
``I need to know everything you have pending before the Securities
Commission as I intend to get with Hillary Clinton within the next few
days,'' McDougal wrote to Madison President John Latham in a July 11,
1985, internal Madison memo obtained by the RTC.
</P>
<P>
The White House acknowledged that Mrs. Clinton may have interceded
while at Rose to help mediate the billing dispute. As for the later
memo from McDougal, John Podesta, a White House spokesman on
Whitewater matters, said Mrs. Clinton did not recall getting together
with McDougal in the summer of 1985 to review the embattled S L's
pending issues.
</P>
<P>
Regardless of any contacts between them and her part in patching up
the Madison-Rose relationship, administration officials asserted, Mrs.
Clinton had no significant professional role with McDougal's financial
institutions or any knowledge of the controversial practices cited
after Madison Guaranty's collapse.
</P>
<P>
But critics suggest that having Mrs. Clinton and Rose in his corner
may have given McDougal the potential of exercising undue influence on
state authorities. A five-month-old special counsel's investigation is
probing whether political influence may have been used to prolong
Madison's existence and run up the eventual cost of the RTC bailout.
</P>
<P>
Former Madison President Latham said that McDougal, who was the
majority stockholder in Madison and effectively controlled day-to-day
management of the S L, told him to use Rose for legal work. In one
conversation ``he said, go to Rose, because Bill and Hillary are my
friends. So I used them (Rose),'' Latham said.

 Traffic Jam on the Net 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When rocker Billy Idol joined the on-line revolution a year ago, he
did it with a requisite snarl. Promoting his album ``Cyberpunk,'' Idol
talked of using the global Internet to circumvent the Establishment
media, to smash the barriers between musicians and their fans. He
widely publicized his electronic-mail address.
</P>
<P>
Good luck finding Idol on-line today. He signed off with a whimper
last month, complaining of the ``overwhelming'' task of answering his
e-mail. ``Right now . . . my mailbox has over 4,000 messages and there
is no way I can personally answer all of them without spending my days
at the computer,'' Idol said in an automated e-mail response to anyone
attempting to reach him on-line.
</P>
<P>
Idol is a victim of self-induced cyber overload. The information
superhighway has not only inspired a slew of bad metaphors, it's
become littered with unique nuisances. There's e-mail glut -- simply
too much mail, from social or business contacts. There are junk
messages -- unwanted commercial spiels posted on public bulletin
boards. And there are e-mail bombs -- time-wasting messages that are
``exploded'' through unsuspecting networks into your personal mailbox.
</P>
<P>
The net used to be a cozy place, a virtual priesthood protected by
its own arcane language and customs. Beard-tugging academics and
helpful scientists set the tone. Now, as more and more techno-tyros
log on, and more firms attempt to exploit the network commercially,
the limits of ``netiquette'' -- the unwritten rules governing
cyberspace -- are being stretched.
</P>
<P>
E-mail traffic on the Internet -- a conglomeration of 20,000
computer networks loosely overseen by the National Science Foundation
 -- has reached more than 800 million messages a month, nearly double
the volume of a year ago. As happened with other communications
breakthroughs that were supposed to make life simpler (voice mail
comes to mind), some e-mail users are beginning to see the down side
of convenience.
</P>
<P>
``Whole work patterns are changing,'' says Dan VanBelleghem,
associate program director for the National Science Foundation's
NSFNET, the largest component of the Internet. ``Before, you would get
to work and chat with your neighbor over a cup of coffee. Now it's
become: ``I'm gonna turn on my PC or Mac and scan through my mail.'
And there's 300 messages, and a lot of it is junk and a lot is hidden,
and you might delete some accidentally, and before you know it, it's
10 a.m.'' VanBelleghem says he's attempting to limit his morning mail
call to 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
An e-mail address still imparts a certain exclusive, cutting-edge
glamour. Entertainment and publishing people are flocking to the net,
hoping to plug in to cultural trends. E-mail also allows an
instantaneous connection to vast amounts of knowledge, in the form of
both data and experts. But ``as soon as e-mail is ubiquitous, people
will have the same problems with it as they do with paper mail and
phone calls,'' says Gail Williams, a manager of the Whole Earth
'Lectronic Link (WELL), a West Coast conferencing system.
</P>
<P>
There are easy solutions: Change your address or install a program
to filter out the junk. But basically, you can't hide. Once you join a
public conference, it's like giving your phone number to 20 million
people. You can't be ``unlisted,'' because the system requires a
return address on every message you send. If you message someone
privately, that person has your address.
</P>
<P>
``There is a potential, because of the way the net is set up, that
you can be mail-bombed or swamped in junk mail,'' says Mike Godwin, an
attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. ``And occasionally
people will do this to you. But it seems to be no more of a problem
than obscene phone calls. There is the potential for all people to
make obscene phone calls, but most people don't act on the impulse.''
</P>
<P>
The Internet's fiber-optic cable capacity isn't close to being
taxed. And ultimately, the humans on the other end of the messages
will find ways to cope.
</P>
<P>
``This is the real world-you should expect the occasional junk
phone call and junk e-mail,'' says Carl Malamud, president of the
Internet Multicasting Service in Washington, a ``cyberstation'' that
relays speech and music over the net. He estimates that he gets 500
e-mail messages a day. ``We filter the junk-we put it in a pile at the
end of the day and then we delete, delete, delete.''

 At CBS, Another Black Eye Blurs Vision of Future 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How's this for high-concept television: A great network lifts
itself out of the ratings cellar and rides high for three years. Then,
all at once, things get rocky. The network loses its top programming
executive, its high-profile sports shows, even some of its affiliates.
As executives search desperately for a new hit, the ratings start to
look shaky again.
</P>
<P>
Can this network be saved?
</P>
<P>
This scenario, as they say on TV, is based on a true story. CBS,
the dominant television network of the early '90s, appears headed for
a fall.
</P>
<P>
Despite winning a ratings triple crown during the last television
season -- taking the top spot in the prime time, daytime and late night
Nielsens -- in recent months the network of ``Murphy Brown'' and ``Late
Night With David Letterman'' has been showing clear signs of
deterioration.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Black Rock, as CBS' New York headquarters is known, was
shaken anew. New World Communications Group Inc., which owns eight TV
stations affiliated with CBS, said it was shifting its loyalties to
Rupert Murdoch's Fox network.
</P>
<P>
The move was widely read as a coup for Fox, which paid $500 million
for the stations' affiliation, and as a major defeat for CBS. Indeed,
the stock market's judgment was swift and harsh: Investors rushed to
sell their CBS shares, knocking nearly $520 million off the company's
value on paper in two days.
</P>
<P>
CBS executives argue the reaction to the New World-Fox deal was
overblown. After all, they said, with its powerful primetime lineup,
CBS should have no trouble persuading other stations in the eight
markets to sign up to carry ``60 Minutes,'' ``Murder, She Wrote'' and
other CBS fare. Fox, sniffed CBS Broadcasting Group President Howard
Stringer last week, is a network of ``downscale sitcoms and
titillating soap operas.''
</P>
<P>
In fact, Fox -- whose ratings have declined 10 percent in the past
two years -- needs the soon-to-be former CBS affiliates more than CBS.
Once it finds stations to replace those it has lost, CBS' ``worst
case'' internal projections call for it to lose about 15 percent of
its current audience in the eight cities.
</P>
<P>
To put that in perspective, the eight stations collectively reach
about 10 percent of the U.S. population. So CBS believes a 15 percent
decline in those markets would knock 1.5 percent off its average
national rating each evening.
</P>
<P>
``We're talking about economically insignificant numbers,'' said
David Poltrack, CBS' top research executive.
</P>
<P>
This glass-is-half-full analysis masks deeper strains at Black
Rock, however. Having to search for (or buy) new affiliates in eight
markets represents another distraction for CBS's top management, which
hardly seems to need another one. At a time when Stringer and CBS
Chairman Laurence Tisch should be taking bows, they are instead
stamping out small brushfires.
</P>
<P>
Said one CBS executive last week, ``It hasn't seemed like much of a
celebration around here.''
</P>
<P>
-O- 
</P>
<P>
Network ratings leadership tends to be cyclical. Popular programs
on one network lose viewers over time, as people gradually drift away
to sample new offerings on competing networks. And after three years
at the top, CBS may be at the end of this cycle, TV analysts say.
</P>
<P>
For one thing, CBS has failed to develop a new hit series during
the recently completed TV season. ``Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman'' has
been its most successful new program, and it debuted in January 1993.
ABC, meanwhile, has scored with ``Home Improvement,'' ``NYPD Blue,''
and ``Grace Under Fire,'' while NBC has a new ratings winner in
``Frasier.''
</P>
<P>
Helped by the addition of the Super Bowl and World Series next
season, ``I think there's a strong chance ABC will replace CBS as
number one,'' said Jack Shubert, corporate media director at Earle
Palmer Brown, a regional ad agency based in Bethesda, Md. ``ABC has a
lot of strong comedies (``Roseanne,'' ``Home Improvement,'' ``Coach,''
etc.) anchoring its schedule during the week. They are in a good
position.''
</P>
<P>
Despite the signs of decline, CBS Inc., the network's parent
company, could be headed for its best financial performance in several
years.
</P>
<P>
One senior official points out that the company is no longer
burdened with the costly baseball and football contracts, and is being
helped by a general recovery in the advertising business (CBS'
earnings rose 28 percent in the first quarter, thanks in part to its
Winter Olympics' telecasts).
</P>
<P>
Indeed, advertising buyers still expect the network to command the
largest share of dollars spent during the upcoming ``upfront'' season,
the period in which ad agencies purchase air time for their clients on
fall programs.
</P>
<P>
But a sense that tougher times could be on the horizon made for
some black moods at Black Rock last week. ``People are very down,''
said one executive last week. ``They'd be lying if they said
otherwise.''

 Events Buffeting CBS 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Among the events buffeting CBS:
</P>
<P>
-- The loss of sports programming. CBS has been outbid for the right
to televise the Super Bowl, the 1996 Olympics, the World Series and,
most important, NFC football games (Murdoch's Fox took the NFC away in
December, paying $1.6 billion).
</P>
<P>
While sports were a hugely expensive proposition -- CBS has written
off more than $600 million from what it paid on its baseball and
football contracts in the past four years -- the big games were, in
fact, loss leaders for the network: They attracted viewers who later
tuned in CBS' primetime programs. ``They're going to save money
(without sports), but this has taken away some of their (promotional)
muscle,'' said Joel Segal, national broadcast director at McCann
Erickson, a major advertising agency.
</P>
<P>
-- A black eye from the cable industry. After persuading Congress to
pass a law enabling broadcast TV owners to negotiate rights payments
from cable companies, CBS was stiff-armed by the cable industry last
summer in its efforts to obtain cash fees for allowing the cable
companies to carry CBS shows. NBC, ABC and Fox, meanwhile, negotiated
deals in which cable companies agreed to air cable channels owned by
the three broadcasting companies.
</P>
<P>
-- A rebuilding job in its programming staff. Jeff Sagansky, the CBS
Entertainment president who engineered CBS' rise in the ratings,
stepped down last month, citing a desire for ``a more entrepreneurial
challenge.'' Since becoming the top programming executive in 1990,
Sagansky took CBS from No. 3 to No. 1 by shoring up what the network
calls ``The Franchise,'' its popular Sunday and Monday night
schedules. Sagansky's successor is Peter Tortorici, the network's
programming strategist.
</P>
<P>
As it is, Sagansky, like NBC's Brandon Tartikoff before him, may be
jumping ship at the right moment.

 1-800 Business Keeps Surging 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Toothpaste containers. Cereal boxes. Car ads. Those 1-800 numbers
that enable you to call companies long distance -- with the companies
picking up the tab -- seem to be everywhere.
</P>
<P>
In fact, there are almost 3 million toll free 1-800 numbers in use
today. And AT T Corp.'s top 800 service marketing executive, Dan
Shulman, predicts that a million more will be added by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
``It's just explosive growth, Shulman said. On a typical day, more
than 40 percent of the 160 million calls that AT T's network carries
are to 800 numbers. Last year, about 22 billion such calls were made,
with AT T accounting for about 60 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
It used to be that 800 numbers were mainly used by Fortune 500
companies, Shulman said. But now companies such as Kiwi International
Air Lines Inc. the Newark-based airline formed a year and a half ago,
rely on them. Kiwi, which has 830 employees and revenue of $125
million, has six toll-free numbers. It uses two as reservation lines
for customers, two for travel agents and two for pilots and other
employees who need to call for schedules and other information.
</P>
<P>
Small and medium-size businesses -- particularly retail groups that
have discovered catalogue shopping -- have been a major source of
growth for the 800 business in recent years, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The 800 business also benefited during the economic downturn, which
forced companies to try to become more marketing savvy, analysts said.
Companies used 800 numbers to try to encourage customers to call -- 
whether to complain, buy or inquire -- because these calls were the
source of rich marketing data.
</P>
<P>
For instance, a car company running nationwide ads listing an 800
number might notice that a majority of the responses come from a
particular region or from people of a particular age, income or sex,
and could target those groups for more attention, said Ed Stukane,
executive vice president of Keyes Martin, an advertising and direct
marketing firm in Springfield, N.J.
</P>
<P>
While toll-free phone service can add considerably to a company's
costs, Shulman said there are ways for firms to minimize their
exposure. For instance, a small Maryland company that sells only to
customers in Maryland and adjacent states could limit its 800 service
to those states.
</P>
<P>
``You can specify that these are the area codes that I want to
receive 800 phone calls from,'' Shulman said. ``Therefore, you are not
paying for calls that don't bring you business.''
</P>
<P>
Jerome Lucas, president of Telestrategies Inc., a McLean, Va.-based
telecommunications consulting firm, said the practice could be seen as
``telecommunications redlining'' and predicted it will become more
controversial in coming years. He said companies may be attracted to
the practice as a way to prevent 800 fraud.
</P>
<P>
Ted Pierson, a Washington telecommunications attorney, said hackers
use machines to dial 800 numbers at random until they get into a phone
system. They then use other machines to find ways to use the phone
system to make outgoing calls. The hackers can then make free
long-distance calls.
</P>
<P>
Because a good portion of such fraudulent calls originate in large
urban areas, such as New York City, Lucas predicted some companies may
try to block toll-free calls from these points.

 Federal Workers Have Chance for Larger '95 Raises (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Clinton administration may not fight legislation
that would give white-collar federal workers a double-barreled raise
in January.
</P>
<P>
The president requested funds for a 1.6 percent civilian-military
raise. Current law, which calls for a series of annual national and
local catchup raises, had targeted employees for a nationwide
across-the-board adjustment of 2.6 percent next year, plus smaller
locality increases. The Senate budget resolution endorses the full
national and locality raises, and the House Treasury, Postal Service
money bill, the usual vehicle for federal pay raises, calls for the
2.6 percent national raise, plus locality raises. The fact that Rep.
Steny Hoyer, D-Md., inserted the language suggests the Clinton
administration has been persuaded not to fight the higher amount.
</P>
<P>
There is lots of generalized support for keeping the 1995 federal
pay raise low -- members of Congress aren't likely to get it -- but it
is not as well organized as the smaller, pro-pay raise coalition built
around the congressional civil service caucus officially known as the
Federal Government Service Task Force. The bipartisan House-Senate
group has one thing in common: All of its members represent states or
districts chock full of civil servants, retirees or military
personnel.
</P>
<P>
Task force members who crossed House-Senate and party lines to keep
the pay raises on track included Maryland Democratic senators Paul
Sarbanes and Barbara Mikulski; representatives Jim Moran, D-Va.; Frank
Wolf, R-Va.; Leslie Byrne, R-Va.; Connie Morella, R-Md.; and Kweisi
Mfume, D-Md.; the District of Columbia's delegate, Eleanor Holmes
Norton, a Democrat; and from beyond the Washington region, Rep. Norm
Dicks, D-Wash., and Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
Giving fully funded raises means executive branch agencies must get
another $400 million (over and above the amount requested by the
president) and the Defense Department will need an addition $300
million. If agencies were forced to ``eat'' the difference, it would
mean they could give full pay raises but would have to fire or
furlough some employees to afford paying the others.
</P>
<P>
The indications that the administration won't make its 1.6 percent
raise a do-or-die effort is a good sign both for 1995 paychecks and
also for low-seniority workers who are first to go in economy-inspired
layoffs.

 WORLD REPORT: D-Day Trial and Triumph Coupled America and Europe 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
News of the D-day landings traveled far and fast.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, newspaper extras carried banner headlines of
the Allied assault on the Normandy beaches of northern France. In
Nazi-occupied Europe the accounts spread by short-wave radio from
Britain.
</P>
<P>
One week shy of her 15th birthday, an excited Jewish girl in
Amsterdam, the Netherlands, named Anne Frank described in the June 6,
1944, entry to her diary how she and her family huddled around a radio
in their attic hideaway to hear details of the invasion.
</P>
<P>
``This is the day,'' she wrote. ``... I have the feeling friends
are approaching.''
</P>
<P>
While it was quickly understood that D-day would alter the course
of World War II irrevocably in the Allies' favor, not even the most
farsighted visionaries were in a position to grasp the event's lasting
significance:
</P>
<P>
-- That the 70,000 Americans who set foot in Northern Europe on that
gray, stormy June day were the vanguard of a U.S. presence that would
not just help win the war, but remain to preside over a half-century
of peace.
</P>
<P>
-- For the United States, D-day was part of a watershed.
</P>
<P>
-- For Europe it was more.
</P>
<P>
-- For better or worse, the Normandy invasion was one of a series of
events that propelled America past the point of no return on the road
toward a permanent global role, a permanent European presence and its
first peacetime alliance.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Psychologically and politically, the U.S. casualties taken that day
and during the subsequent 11 months of fighting until Nazi Germany's
surrender gave America little option but to push aside instinct,
reject a return to isolationism and instead stay on to help preserve
the peace in Europe.
</P>
<P>
In the years since, about 16 million American service personnel and
their dependents have served in Europe.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Only the collapse of communism, a deepening budgetary crisis and a
string of pressing domestic problems have led Washington to begin
unwinding its presence in the region. From a peak of 325,000 in 1989,
U.S. troop strength in Europe now stands at about 150,000. It is
scheduled to fall to 109,000 by the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The troop withdrawal reflects a larger shift in America's national
priorities -- those now embodied in Bill Clinton. As a result, more
question marks hang over the future of the transatlantic relationship
than at any time since the Iron Curtain fell across Europe. For
Europeans, adrift on a sea of frightening new problems and searching
to redefine themselves and their role in a post-Cold War world, this
ebbing American interest is disturbing.
</P>
<P>
After all, they owe a lot to their transatlantic partner.
</P>
<P>
It was, for example, the American military and economic support in
the early post-war years that halted the Soviet Union's westward
advance, steadied governments vulnerable to communist takeover in
France, Italy and Greece and kept West Berlin alive with a 15-month
airlift.
</P>
<P>
As Soviet Cold War bullying intensified, it was a U.S. president,
John F. Kennedy, who traveled to Germany, reminded Moscow that the
defense of America began in Berlin, then declared himself a citizen of
the beleaguered city with his famous declaration, ``Ich bin ein
Berliner.''
</P>
<P>
It was U.S. pressure that helped pave the way for Germany's swift
rehabilitation into the community of Western democracies and American
money that flowed into an exhausted Western Europe under the Marshall
Plan, restoring hope and igniting an unprecedented economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
And it was leaders such as Dean Acheson, Dwight D. Eisenhower and
John Foster Dulles, who repeatedly gave crucial support to the French
visionary Jean Monnet as he worked to overcome regional jealousies to
build a European Common Market.
</P>
<P>
``We've all buried the amazing importance of America in process of
European integration,'' said William Wallace, a senior research fellow
at Oxford University's St. Antony's College. ``The whole thing was
American-driven.''
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Added Pierre Jacquet, deputy director of the French Institute of
International Relations, ``Without it (the American presence), Europe
would have fallen back again into the 1930s, with nations trying to
export their problems to each other.''
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Common Market's successor -- the European Union -- 
stands at the center of the Continent's future. It is about to enlarge
from 12 to 16 member states and -- albeit hesitantly -- has reached out
to the former Soviet satellite states in the east. EU member nations
still squabble with each other, but war between them is only a
slightly less remote possibility than armed conflict between
California and Nevada.

The Vietnam War debacle, coupled with Western Europe's growing
economic strength, the student revolutions that swept the region in
1968 and the dollar crises of the early 1970s ended the European sense
of awe for America that characterized much of the relationship's early
years.
</P>
<P>
Some sharp foreign policy clashes during the Carter and Reagan
presidencies and a love-hate relationship with the growing American
cultural invasion led many Europeans to nurture a new stereotype of
the United States -- that of a powerful, but naive ally, whose
quick-trigger, overly simplistic world view constituted a danger only
slightly less than that emanating from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
But few on either side of the Atlantic could challenge the reality
that Western Europe's stunning revival had unfolded and matured under
the protection of America's security guarantees. Indeed, many argue
that both a long-term American political role and military presence in
Europe remain vital for the continent's stability.
</P>
<P>
Anyone watching the EU's futile efforts to prevent conflicts on its
own within the region would be hard-pressed not to agree. The war in
Yugoslavia, the first major political crisis post-war Europeans have
had to face without immediate American leadership, has been a
diplomatic disaster and a demoralizing blow to the EU's
self-confidence -- in addition to a great human tragedy.
</P>
<P>
``Our biggest problem is that for the last 50 years, America has
told us what to do,'' said Wallace, the Oxford fellow. ``We may not
have liked it, but it always gave us a starting point. Now this is
gone.''
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Added Stanley Crossick, chairman of the Belmont European Policy
Center, a Brussels-based political think tank:
</P>
<P>
``We got things right after the war because of strong U.S.
leadership, the brilliance of the Marshall Plan and the vision of our
own statesmen. Now we no longer have the same U.S. leadership, our own
leaders are weak and there's no Marshall Plan.''
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
But there remain many elements that will keep America and Europe
locked together.
</P>
<P>
Despite the new importance of Japan and other Asian markets,
Western Europe remains America's biggest overseas trading partner.
Since 1945, the Old World has drawn an estimated $200 billion in U.S.
private investment -- roughly 40 cents of every American dollar
invested overseas. The $195 billion in EU-U.S. trade last year
accounted for more than one quarter of all global exports.
</P>
<P>
Such figures help support the claim that America's decision to
defend Western Europe was no act of altruism, but far more a policy
based on enlightened self-interest that has paid off.

 WORLD REPORT: France Wages Rearguard Action Against Americana 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While many Europeans are ill at ease with the intrusions of
Americana, only the French have cared enough to seriously fight it.
Over the years, they have launched a series of counterattacks -- most
notably in December, when they fought to the last bitter minute to
successfully retain their leaky defenses against the growing influx of
American films and television programs during global trade
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Declaring the defense of the French language a ``political
priority,'' Premier Edouard Balladur's government has also passed a
law requiring that a minimum of 40 percent of all songs played over
the country's airwaves be in French and issued an official dictionary
of some 3,500 new terms, such as ``restauration rapide'' instead of
fast food and ``disque audionumerique'' instead of compact disc, to
replace Anglicisms that have crept into the language.
</P>
<P>
However, a walk through Paris is proof that Americana is well
entrenched. A tiny sandwich shop just off the Place de la Bastille,
for example, seemed typically French -- except for the Hollywood
chewing gum, the Jack Daniels whiskey, the Getaway pinball machine in
the corner, and the framed photo of a Harley-Davidson motorcycle on
the wall.

 WORLD REPORT: American Cultural Influence Forges New European Bonds 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
D-Day marked a watershed in American political, military and
economic involvement in Europe, and with 16 million American
servicemen and their dependents having been stationed in Europe since
then, a powerful transatlantic cultural bond has been forged and
continues to grow despite European ambivalence.
</P>
<P>
From the GI chewing gum, jazz music and Ernest Hemingway paperbacks
in the late 1940s, to the Levi's, NFL sweat shirts, Pizza Hut
restaurants, hard-rock music, Hollywood films and TV game shows found
virtually everywhere in Western Europe, American soft-power has
steamrollered the continent.
</P>
<P>
It is a truth that makes many Europeans wince, but 3½ decades after
the Treaty of Rome committed them to the path of integration, the
common thread through Western European mass culture is American.
</P>
<P>
``At the mass level, it has contributed to a cultural
homogenization across Europe,'' declared Philipp Borinski, part of an
academic team at Mainz University that is studying the future of the
transatlantic relationship.
</P>
<P>
American pop music, scientific writings and successful business
styles helped catapult English into the role of a de facto
international language, adding further to this cultural impact.
Widespread knowledge of English has made northern Europe especially
vulnerable to American influence and, although the Romanesque
countries to the south have resisted this trend, they too have
succumbed, at least in part.
</P>
<P>
``These countries are more influenced than they like to admit,''
noted Wilfried Wiegand, who edits the cultural pages of Germany's
leading national daily, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. ``In Italy
it's now fashionable for young people to eat hamburgers and learn
English. In a country that values form and elegance, this is a way for
young people to show they are different.''
</P>
<P>
In Germany, American ideas flooded into a cultural vacuum left in
the wake of Nazism. Probably nowhere else in Europe have American
habits and tastes -- from jazz clubs to corporate board rooms -- taken
greater hold.
</P>
<P>
While the reaction to the Vietnam War and the 1968 student protests
both carried a distinctly anti-American character and worked to
tarnish America's image as a political role model, they paradoxically
strengthened the American cultural impact.
</P>
<P>
With few home-grown symbols to challenge the Establishment, Western
Europe's young revolutionaries listened to the protest messages of
Joan Baez and Bob Dylan, cultivated Andy Warhol's art and adopted
Eldridge Cleaver and Angela Davis as political heroes.
</P>
<P>
``It was a lifestyle revolution in the direction of America,'' said
Borinski, who views 1968 as a clear break from traditional West
European mores, one that has brought Europe permanently closer to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
He argued that American cultural influence has generated a greater
sense of personal freedom in Germany, eroded authoritarian strains
within society, and generally boosted the status and confidence of the
individual -- all developments that have enabled western Germans to
thrive in a free-market, democratic environment.
</P>
<P>
``There's a sort of social, cultural convergence taking place
that's making (Western) Europe and the U.S. more similar,'' Borinski
said. ``I think it has a positive effect in that it helps create a
much broader understanding -- above all among younger generations,
which have been welded together in a common youth culture.''

 Senate Delegation Recommends U.S.-Soviet Exercises 
 Be Moved to America (Moscow) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bipartisan delegation from the Senate Armed Services
Committee said Tuesday it would recommend that the first joint
exercises involving U.S. and Russian ground troops be moved from
Russia to the United States because of nationalist hostility here to
the planned maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the committee, said that after
meeting with Russian legislators ``it was apparent that this was a
sensitive area.'' As a result, the Senate delegation unanimously
decided to recommend to President Clinton that the exercises ``be held
on American soil at a suitable military base and at a suitable time to
both the American and Russian side.''
</P>
<P>
The joint peacekeeping exercises, involving about 250 troops from
each side, had been set for July near the city of Orenburg on the
Volga River. The Russian military had favored the maneuvers, which
would allow the former enemies to engage in joint operations for the
first time, but nationalist and Communist forces strongly opposed
them, saying U.S. forces should never set foot in ``Holy Russia.''
</P>
<P>
Last month Russian President Boris Yeltsin had asked the Defense
Ministry to reconsider the exercises. Since then, top defense
officials have given mixed signals about the maneuvers, but it was
clear that planning had all but stopped.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William J. Perry had hailed the joint
exercise as proof of a new cooperative era in military relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Russian parliamentary leaders, wary of handing hard-line
nationalists such a visible and emotional cause, were clearly relieved
by Nunn's proposal. ``It's not just a question of substance in such
matters but a matter of tact,'' said Vladimir Lukin, former ambassador
to the United States, who now heads the Parliament's foreign affairs
committee.
</P>
<P>
Nunn said the delegation of four Republicans and three Democrats
was somewhat taken aback when the issue of the joint maneuvers was
raised because in Washington they had been told that, after some
flip-flops by the Russian side, the exercise ``was now back on
course.''
</P>
<P>
``This exercise is not designed to use armored vehicles or tanks.
It is not even designed for live firing. But it has obviously been a
sensitive subject here, and it seems to me we can further our
objectives by beginning . . . in the U.S.,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Nunn said he hopes U.S. troops will eventually be able to come to
Russia for joint exercises. ``It would be my hope that there would be
reciprocity and that at some point in the future we would have that
kind of further peacekeeping exercises here in Russia,'' he said.

 Pol Pot's Best Pal: Thailand 
 Abramowitz, president of the Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace, 
 was U.S. ambassador to Thailand from 1978 to 1981. 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cambodia awoke from a 20-year nightmare last May with historic
U.N.-sponsored elections. Ninety percent of the population defied
Khmer Rouge threats to vote for peace. There was hope that Cambodia
was on the road to reconciliation. But what a difference a year makes.
</P>
<P>
Today Pol Pot's weakened forces are on the attack again. In the
past few months the Khmer Rouge have recaptured their Pailin
headquarters from the government, establishing control over areas in
northern and western Cambodia and displacing 60,000 villagers.
</P>
<P>
The ineffectiveness of the Phnom Penh government and an
ill-conceived military campaign are key reasons for Khmer Rouge
successes. But a major external factor is Thailand's help for the
Khmer Rouge. The Thai military provides them goods and, reportedly,
arms and gives their leadership sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
Despite Thailand's impressive growth and steady if halting moves
toward democracy, the Thai military and its civilian supporters
dominate foreign policy, particularly toward Cambodia and the other
nearby states of Burma, Laos and Vietnam. The cross-border gem and
timber transactions between Thailand and Cambodia are murky but highly
profitable for both sides -- as much as $20 million per month. Yet,
there are reasons beyond lucre for Thailand's de facto alliance with
the Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government's attitude toward Cambodia has been shaped by a
troubled history. Bangkok never liked the earlier Sihanouk government
and helped stoke up border insurgencies. In the 1980s, when the
overriding concern was getting the Vietnamese out of Cambodia, the
United States and Southeast Asian nations did not put any priority on
ending Thai and Chinese support for Pol Pot. The Vietnamese left after
the 1991 Paris Peace Agreement. China reportedly ceased its support,
leaving Thailand holding a monopoly on dirty work.
</P>
<P>
Some Thais want to keep a hand in Cambodian affairs and create a
sort of permanent buffer zone against a renascent Vietnam. A senior
Thai official told me in 1992 that protecting the Khmer Rouge was an
important element of Thai security. The Thai government publicly
proclaims the opposite and provides economic assistance to the Phnom
Penh government, but even if it doesn't condone the military's
complicity with the Khmer Rouge in violation of Cambodia's
sovereignty, it has not controlled the practice.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it cannot, given the Thai government's weakness relative to
the army. Whether by graft or statecraft, Thailand has become Pol
Pot's best ally. The war in Cambodia could have been brought to an end
and 370,000 refugees returned from Thailand only by the largest U.N.
peace-keeping and assistance operation ever assembled, costing $2
billion. Now only the world community can help ensure that Cambodia's
pathetically weak state and its hopes for rehabilitation are not
destroyed by the Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
Pol Pot's insurgents have suffered serious political setbacks and
losses of manpower, but they are tenacious fighters who survived a war
with the far tougher Vietnamese -- with outside support. The United
States and regional governments need to focus on the issue. Sihanouk's
declining health has added urgency.
</P>
<P>
The problem is tough to crack. Trade sanctions and other punitive
efforts against a friendly Thailand would be ridiculous. Providing
weapons and training to the Cambodian government might help, but one
can't have much confidence in a top-heavy army whose rolls exaggerate
the true numbers of servicemen. The only tools remaining are moral and
diplomatic suasion -- continually reminding the Thais that they are
undermining a neighbor and the costly work of the world community.
Bangkok will resist having the issue raised, but doing so
multilaterally can put greater pressure on the military and perhaps
induce Thailand's top figures, including its respected monarch, to
weigh in.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Warren Christopher's participation in
Association of Southeast Asian Nation (ASEAN) meetings in Bangkok this
July offers a prime opportunity to air the world's concerns about
Cambodia. ASEAN came into its own during the Cambodian crisis, which
for 10 years was the focus of ASEAN discussions. A voluble Singapore
leadership spearheaded the effort to get the Vietnamese out. Since
Vietnam's departure, Singapore's interest has evaporated; it doesn't
even have an embassy in Phnom Penh, and its aid is virtually
invisible. ASEAN discussions about Cambodia have been perfunctory.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN must be brought around to face the Khmer Rouge problem and
focus on how to reduce Pol Pot's capacities and strengthen the
government's. It needs to consider Cambodia's early membership. ASEAN
and its new security forum won't become effective instruments for
regional stability if members refuse to discuss some issues that make
them uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
As for the United States, President Clinton has rightly said that
we cannot solve every world problem. But we should work with others
when U.S. participation can make a difference. Working with our
Western allies and ASEAN countries to help break the Thai-Khmer Rouge
connection is such an opportunity. If we don't take it, Cambodia's
resurrection could be short-lived.

 Human-Rights Conference Opens (Manila) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MANILA, Philippines
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A conference on human rights in
Indonesian-ruled East Timor opened here Tuesday despite intense
opposition from the Philippine and Indonesian governments and a ban on
34 foreign participants, including the wife of France's president and
a Nobel Peace Prize winner.
</P>
<P>
The privately sponsored Asia-Pacific Conference on East Timor,
organized by opponents of Indonesia's 1976 annexation of the former
Portuguese colony, convened after the Philippine Supreme Court
overturned an injunction against it. However, the court upheld the
government's right to ban foreigners from entering the country to
participate in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Authorities threatened to arrest several foreign delegates who
eluded the ban and attended the opening session. But a phalanx of
priests, nuns and chanting students surrounded the foreign delegates
as they were escorted to the University of the Philippines conference
site from nearby hostels.
</P>
<P>
The charged emotions, large Filipino turnout and heavy press
coverage of the conference indicated Indonesian pressure on the
Philippines to block the gathering had backfired badly. A number of
politicians and commentators complained that by bowing to Jakarta's
``bullying'' tactics, the government had undermined the Philippines'
democratic principles and tarnished its international reputation.
</P>
<P>
The result has been to focus far more attention on the plight of
East Timor here and abroad than would probably have been the case if
the conference had proceeded without interference, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
Although the Philippines and East Timor share a Roman Catholic
religious heritage, Indonesia's invasion, annexation and subsequent
occupation of the territory had never been an issue here. An estimated
100,000 East Timorese, a sixth of the population, died during the
1970s as a result of the invasion, a subsequent famine and efforts to
crush guerrilla resistance, human-rights groups have reported.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read for her at the opening session of the five-day
conference, Ireland's Mairead Maguire, who shared the 1976 Nobel Peace
Prize, accused Indonesia of engaging in ``barbarism'' against the
people of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Maguire, 50, was one of 10 foreigners who were detained at Manila's
airport and deported on orders of President Fidel Ramos to prevent
them from attending the conference.
</P>
<P>
Danielle Mitterrand, president of the human-rights group
France-Libertes and wife of French President Francois Mitterrand, was
originally scheduled to deliver the conference's keynote speech but
canceled after she was blacklisted. She said Monday in Paris that
Indonesia had exerted ``tyrannical pressure'' and ``a kind of
blackmail'' on her and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
A Philippine senator said banning Mitterrand was a major political
blunder, given that Ramos is scheduled to visit France in September
and his wife, Amelita Ramos, has been invited to open a Philippine
exhibition at a Paris museum next month.
</P>
<P>
Three bishops, a prominent Japanese priest and the head of
Indonesia's largest Muslim organization also were blacklisted.
Organizers said one of the bishops died six months ago.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines' Roman Catholic prelate, Cardinal Jaime Sin, joined
the storm of criticism. In a letter Monday to the bishop of Dili, the
East Timorese capital, Sin said he was ``sorry to see the political
leaders of my own nation giving in to the pressure of a foreign
nation.''
</P>
<P>
Ramos justified his ban on foreign participants in the conference
by asserting that freedom of speech and assembly were outweighed by
``national security'' issues. In applying pressure to block the
meeting, Indonesia had hinted that, among other measures, it could
promote the cause of Muslim separatists in the southern Philippines,
presidential aides said.

 U.S. Allegations of Drug Trafficking by Thai Legislators 
 Throw Thailand's Parliament Into Uproar (Bangkok) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BANGKOK, Thailand
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. allegations of drug trafficking by Thai
legislators have thrown Thailand's parliament into an uproar and
raised the prospect of the first major test of a new extradition
treaty.
</P>
<P>
So far, three opposition legislators have been publicly named by
U.S. officials as suspects in drug-trafficking cases, and reports that
others might be implicated have aroused apprehension among jittery
politicians.
</P>
<P>
The publicity has focused attention on the role of big money in
Thai politics and fueled concerns that the parliament's reputation is
being damaged.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is a conduit for much of the heroin produced in the Golden
Triangle, the border area where Burma, Thailand and Laos meet. The
huge profits generated by the drug trade have sowed corruption among
Thai politicians, security officials and businessmen at the local and
national levels, U.S. and Thai sources charge.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent State Department report, efforts to fight
drug trafficking and money laundering in Thailand are hampered by such
factors as ``widespread police and military corruption'' and ``the
narcotics involvement of some politicians.''
</P>
<P>
More than 60 percent of the heroin entering the United States comes
from the Golden Triangle, U.S. officials estimate. Burma produces
nearly 90 percent of the triangle's annual yield of more than 2,500
tons of opium, the raw material for heroin. Some analysts predict a
record crop this year of more than 3,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Thanong Siripreechapong, 42, was forced to resign from
parliament after a judge in San Francisco unsealed a 1991 indictment
accusing him of involvement in smuggling more than 45 tons of
marijuana from Thailand to the United States between 1973 and 1987.
The indictment said Thanong was paid more than $13 million in a series
of deals.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the U.S. government seized about $1 million in assets -- 
including a Beverly Hills house and a Mercedes-Benz -- that Thanong was
found to have acquired in the United States with proceeds from drug
smuggling. He was notified twice of U.S. forfeiture proceedings but
did not appear.
</P>
<P>
Thanong denied the charges and said he wanted to fly to the United
States to clear his name. The U.S. Embassy here responded it would
facilitate the trip, but that if he did enter the United States, he
would be ``arrested immediately.''
</P>
<P>
The Chart Thai party, the largest of five parties in opposition to
the coalition government of Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, expelled
Thanong after finding inconsistencies in his testimony in
parliamentary hearings. He had represented the northeastern province
of Nakhon Phanom, known as Thailand's premier marijuana growing area.
</P>
<P>
Thailand faces a dilemma over the prospect that U.S. authorities
might seek Thanong's extradition. The case already has generated a
debate over whether a Thai citizen can legally be extradited to stand
trial in a foreign country. Extradition of Thai nationals has
previously been banned, but the current constitution is ambiguous on
the issue, and a 1992 extradition treaty with the United States
neither authorizes nor forbids it.
</P>
<P>
If the government decides Thanong cannot be extradited, it may
decide to prosecute him here, officials said. But it remains to be
seen whether Thai authorities could try him based on foreign evidence
for offenses committed before a new Thai conspiracy law took effect.
</P>
<P>
In a parliamentary session May 19, Mongkol Chongsuthanamanee, 48,
tearfully denied involvement in the drug trade after it was disclosed
that he had been denied a U.S. visa because his name is on a narcotics
watch list. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has implicated
Mongkol in a conspiracy to smuggle heroin to the United States, but
currently lacks evidence to indict him, a U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
Mongkol, who represents the opposition Chart Pattana party from
Chiang Rai, a northern town bordering the Golden Triangle, called the
allegations against him ``rubbish'' and threatened to sue the Thai
Foreign Ministry and U.S. Embassy for defamation. A brother, Arun
Chongsuthanamanee, is seeking commutation of a 1992 death sentence for
drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Mongkol is a protege of Narong Wongwan, who was in line to become
Thailand's prime minister in 1992 until the State Department confirmed
that he too had been denied a visa on suspicion of drug trafficking.
Narong's nomination to head a pro-military coalition was later
scuttled, and Gen. Suchinda Kraprayoon was chosen instead. Suchinda's
accession to the premiership then prompted massive protests in which
hundreds of democracy demonstrators were killed by the army before
Suchinda was forced to resign.
</P>
<P>
Narong, who is still in parliament, remains barred from entering
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The allegations linking legislators to drug dealing came to a head
after Thai newspapers quoted Foreign Minister Prasong Soonsiri as
telling a cabinet meeting that he had a U.S. list of 17 politicians,
including 10 opposition legislators, suspected of being traffickers.
</P>
<P>
Opposition legislators demanded that he name the suspects and
traded insults with government members.
</P>
<P>
Prasong dismissed the reports, and the U.S. Embassy denied
providing any such list. However, lists compiled by Thai academic and
media sources quickly began circulating, including one that named
three senior members of the government.
</P>
<P>
``I have to confirm that several politicians, both at the local and
national levels, are suspected of being involved in the drug trade,''
Prime Minister Chuan told parliament. He acknowledged having a list of
suspected drug-dealing politicians, but declined to disclose details.

 Editors:

   Here is an early look at the stories the Los Angeles Times is
considering for its first-edition Page 1 for Wednesday:

   ROSTY-TIMES -- WASHINGTON -- Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., is
indicted on 17 felony counts of fraud and embezzlement that include
taking kickbacks of government funds from a son-in-law and buying cars
for family members with public and campaign money. The
much-broader-than- anticipated allegations also accuse the veteran
lawmaker of personally tampering with a witness, instructing him not
to reveal incriminating information to a federal grand jury, and
paying employees who performed little or no official work but did such
chores as photographing a Rostenkowski daughter's wedding and mowing
the lawn of his summer home. A spokesman says that Rostenkowski will
formally step aside as House Ways and Means chairman because of the
indictment, in conformance with Democratic Caucus rules. By Ronald J.
Ostrow.

   ROSTY-PROFILE -- WASHINGTON -- In many respects, Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski never left Chicago and its political folkways, despite
spending nearly 36 years in Congress and achieving a lasting national
legacy for his key role in overhauling U.S. income tax laws in 1986. A
towering bear of a man who occasionally intimidated his colleagues,
Rostenkowski's brusque style reflected the blunt, take-no-prisoners
politics practiced in his hometown. So the aggressive ``Rosty'' was
doing what comes naturally when he decided to go to the mat with
federal prosecutors rather than holler uncle. Driven by a passion for
political power, the 66-year-old lawmaker hoped to climax his career
by playing a leading part in passage of health care legislation that
would add to his reputation for accomplishments against the odds.
Probably his proudest accomplishment was passage of the 1986 tax law,
which reduced the top rate to 28 percent and eliminated many tax
loopholes for business. On the downside, Rostenkowski's reputation
suffered because of his unashamed appetite for perks, including steak
dinners at lobbyists' expense and invitations to free golfing trips at
some of the nation's top resorts. By William J. Eaton.

   BENEFITS -- The Clinton administration announces plans to issue
plastic cards to millions of Social Security, public assistance and
government pension recipients so they can obtain their benefits
electronically from automated teller machines and grocery store
terminals. When fully phased in, the Electronic Benefit Transfer
initiative eventually could account for as much as $111 billion in
annual transactions under an array of federal programs, says Vice
President Al Gore, whose ``reinventing government'' task force
endorsed the concept. Initially, the program would be limited to the
Food Stamp program administered by the Department of Agriculture and
some assistance programs managed by the Department of Health and Human
Services. By Jeff Leeds.

   COURT-CURFEW -- WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court gives a boost to the
growing number of cities that enforce curfews for teen-agers, as the
justices refuse to consider a constitutional challenge to a Dallas law
that generally requires persons under 17 to be off the streets after
11 p.m. on weekdays. Without a dissenting vote, the court rejects an
appeal filed on behalf of three young people and their parents who
said that the city law ``convicts the innocent ... and broadly stifles
fundamental liberties.'' In earlier rulings, the justices had said
that the Constitution does not give teen-agers a ``generalized right
of social association.'' Moreover, official discrimination based on
age is permissible. Lawyers in the case said that as many as 1,000
cities have sought to combat juvenile crime by imposing curfews for
teen-agers. By David G. Savage.

Previously, Watkins, head of the office of administration, had
authority to approve helicopter flights.
</P>
<P>
The White House also released a summary of 11 other helicopter
trips by members of the White House staff, saying they all appeared to
be proper uses of the helicopter. ``There were no other instances of
abuse,'' White House press secretary Dee Dee Myers said. She said a
review of staff use of fixed-wing aircraft would be released later
this month.
</P>
<P>
The other trips generally involved White House military and
communications personnel, three times to classified locations.
Secetary of State Warren Christopher flew to Williamsburg, Va., for a
Senate Democratic retrat, and Secretary of Housing and Urban
Development Henry Cisneros and Deputy Office of Management and Budget
Director Alice M. Rivlin went on a ``special training mission'' to a
classified location.
</P>
<P>
Watkins himself went to Camp David for ``camp familiarization''
last April and to Beltsville, Md., for ``orientation and training''
last September.
</P>
<P>
Watkins' decision to reimburse the government spares his former
administration colleagues from having to chip in for the reimbursement
and -- the White House hopes -- puts an end to the embarrassing episode.
</P>
<P>
After moving quickly to force Watkins to resign from his post as
director of administration, the White House fumbled its handling of
the matter. It belatedly discovered that a second helicopter was
involved and -- after Watkins balked at paying the tab -- scrambled to
put together contributions from nearly the entire senior staff to pay
for the cost, billing the money as a ``gesture of friendship'' to the
fired aide.
</P>
<P>
Although President Clinton announced that the taxpayers would not
be out ``one red cent'' from the helicopter incident, Watkins
initially refused to pay any more than a share of the costs. He
insisted he had done nothing wrong and would not pay up as a matter of
principle, White House sources said.
</P>
<P>
But Watkins said Tuesday that he called Chief of Staff Thomas F.
``Mack'' McLarty Monday night and said he would repay the full amount.
Watkins, a Little Rock advertising executive whose
financial-disclosure statement shows his net worth at more than $1
million, said in a telephone interview Tuesday that when he learned
the amount had grown far beyond the few thousand dollars he originally
believed the trip would cost, he decided his former colleagues should
not be saddled with the bill.
</P>
<P>
Watkins said he had orginally believed the cost would be only about
$2,500, and likened the contributions promised by 13 senior aides to
``buying tickets to Barbra Streisand.'' But, he said, ``When it's over
$1,000, it's braces for your children's teeth. It could be a financial
burden for some.''
</P>
<P>
Watkins added, ``While I contend I did nothing wrong, I was
carrying out the duties of my job, it was something that I was
involved with and so I should go ahead and not create any resentment
or any more resentment.''
</P>
<P>
The 55-mile trip to Camp David and the nearby Holly Hills Country
Club became public when the Frederick (Md.) News-Post published a
photograph of Watkins and other adminisration officials about to board
the presidential helicopter after playing 18 holes of golf. Watkins
was accompanided by Alphonso Maldon, the head of the White House
military office, who the White House said would be reassigned, and by
the Camp David commander.
</P>
<P>
In his letter of resignation to Presdient Cliton, Watkins defended
his actions as ``in fulfillment of the responsibilities of my
position,'' which includes oversight for Camp David. He said ``there
simply was no effort on my part to use White House or military
equipment for personal or recreational purposes'' and that his ``sole
motivation was determining how you (Clinton) could utilize Camp David
more frequently.''

 U.S. Expresses Concern Over Taiwan Airline (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration has expressed
concern about a rash of accidents and incidents involving China
Airlines, the official airline of Taiwan, and ``invited'' the company
to discuss how the United States can help improve it, an official said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
``We expect very shortly that they will be able to sit down with us
and discuss specific assistance we can give them,'' said Anthony J.
Broderick, the FAA's associate administrator for regulation and
certification.
</P>
<P>
While it couched the message in polite language, the FAA
effectively put China Airlines on notice it expects the company to
take action on safety-related issues.
</P>
<P>
The airline, stunned by a series of incidents that appear to be
related to poor training or unprofessional behavior, has instituted a
retraining program for all its pilots. The Transport Ministry of
Taiwan has also warned the airline -- which flies dozens of
international routes including to and from the United States and owns
at least 30 wide-bodied airliners -- to enforce Taiwanese aviation law.
</P>
<P>
Tests show that drinking may have been a contributing factor in the
latest crash, April 26 at Nagoya Airport in Japan, in which 264 people
were killed and seven survived. The Japan Times, in Tuesday's
editions, said the head of the National Public Safety Commission has
confirmed widespread reports that both pilots had been drinking.
</P>
<P>
Commission chairman Hajima Ishii said tests showed the pilot had a
blood alcohol content of .013 and the copilot, who was flying the
wide-body Airbus A300-622R, .055.
</P>
<P>
If the crew did all their drinking on the ground before the more
than three-hour flight, the copilot would have had a blood alcohol
content nearing 0.1, considered legally drunk in many countries.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary report on the accident by the government of France,
where the Airbus is manufactured, said the crew lost control of the
airplane on the landing approach as the copilot attempted to descend
by pushing forward on the control yoke, apparently unaware that he was
in effect fighting the autopilot. The plane stalled twice and fell.
</P>
<P>
This was the most serious of a number of China Airlines incidents,
including the crash landing of a Boeing 747-400 in Hong Kong and an
in-flight incident involving the autopilot on another 747.
</P>
<P>
``That seems to be a number (of incidents) higher than one would
expect from an airline this size,'' Broderick said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Broderick said the airline seems to be taking the problem
seriously, but the FAA wants to be ``helpful'' because many Americans
fly the airline and its jets fly in U.S. airspace.
</P>
<P>
The FAA move is part of a growing tendency to become directly
involved in world aviation matters. The agency has opened new offices
in several Asian countries, and is actively involved in helping Russia
deal with its mounting aviation problems.
</P>
<P>
``We place a fairly high priority on that,'' Broderick said.
</P>
<P>
Although the agency usually speaks softly, its suggestions carry
weight because it could ban any carrier from landing in the United
States on safety grounds.
</P>
<P>
Countries often ask for U.S. help with aviation safety from the FAA
and the National Transportation Safety Board. China, for example,
recently requested U.S. advice after its newly independent regional
airlines developed major safety problems.

 Rabin Complains About Contacts With Syria (Jerusalem) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin told a
parliamentary panel Tuesday that he was disappointed with recent
contacts between Israel and Syria and that the United States' effort
at mediation through Secretary of State Warren Christopher has
``exhausted itself.''
</P>
<P>
Rabin, reiterating Israel's offer for a phased withdrawal from the
Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle
East war, complained that Damascus is ``playing for time,'' and added,
``We can't say right now that Syria is serious about peace.''
</P>
<P>
Rabin's comments to the closed-door meeting of the Foreign Affairs
and Defense Committee were relayed to reporters by an official. They
follow a recent visit to the region by Christopher, who carried
messages back and forth between Damascus and Jerusalem and said the
two sides had begun a new phase of substantive negotiations.
</P>
<P>
However, Rabin has pressed for direct, secret talks with Syria,
which President Hafez Assad has firmly rejected. Rabin has also
pressed for a phased withdrawal in which Israel would exchange some
land for a series of normalization steps from Syria. But Assad has
insisted on a total withdrawal in exchange for peace.
</P>
<P>
Rabin said that so far Syria has not agreed to return to the peace
talks in Washington, which were interrupted after the massacre in
Hebron on Feb. 25 of 29 Muslims by a Jewish settler. But he said he
did not think much was being accomplished there. ``The Washington
talks are an exercise in treading water,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
While Israel would like Christopher to be involved, Rabin said,
``in fact Washington has exhausted itself'' with the shuttle missions.
</P>
<P>
Rabin's comments seemed to run counter to statements from the
Clinton administration suggesting that Christopher was making
progress.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Los Angeles Times quoted President Clinton as saying
in an interview that ``we've got delicate negotiations in the Middle
East right now'' and ``the secretary of state is involved and . . .
the last thing in the world I need to be doing is considering changing
my team.''
</P>
<P>
Privately, Israeli officials have faulted Christopher for what they
describe as episodic involvement in the Israeli-Syrian negotiations.
Some officials would like to see a greater American involvement,
although Rabin has made clear he wants to get the Gaza-Jericho
agreement with the Palestinians implemented before pressing ahead with
territorial concessions on the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Rabin was asked about a comment made by Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak to American newspaper editors this week. Mubarak reportedly
said Rabin had told him Israel ``doesn't intend on keeping one
centimeter of the territory which was occupied from Syria in 1967 but
is demanding in exchange from Syria full peace with all its
components.''
</P>
<P>
Rabin said there was ``no way'' he had said this, and he reiterated
his proposals for a phased pullout, saying the first stage would not
involve removing any Jewish settlements.

 Senators Suggest Switch of Russian-U.S. Maneuvers to U.S. (Moscow) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A delegation of U.S. senators on Tuesday sought to defuse
anti-American sentiment by proposing that joint military exercises,
which were to be conducted in Russia, take place instead on American
soil.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Russia agreed to the maneuvers in September,
with both governments categorizing the exercise as a dry run for
possible future peacekeeping operations. The drill was to take place
in July at the Totsk testing ground in the Ural Mountains. Its
significance was to be more symbolic than military, as the entire
operation was to involve only 250 soldiers from each side, no heavy
equipment and no live fire.
</P>
<P>
Still, communists and nationalists here seized on the notion of
``Yankee'' soldiers on Russian territory as further evidence of what
they see as a continued attempt by the United States to impose its
will on a weakened Russia.
</P>
<P>
``Russia cannot be made a training ground for the American Army,''
lawmaker Pyotr P. Shirshov, an army officer from Bryansk, said in a
heated debate last month.
</P>
<P>
Faced with stiff opposition in Parliament and in the Urals, the
Russian government on Friday quietly asked the United States to
postpone the exercises.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, a bipartisan delegation from the U.S. Senate Armed
Services Committee arrived to learn that the maneuvers, meant to
showcase the new cooperation between the old adversaries, had instead
fallen victim to resurgent Russian nationalism.
</P>
<P>
Some conservative Russians interpreted the American push for the
exercises as, `` `We won the Cold War and now we're going to show you
our stuff' -- which is not at all what it was meant to be,'' said Sen.
Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
Given the ``sensitivity'' of the issue, Armed Services Committee
Chairman Sen. Sam Nunn, D.-Ga., said the seven senators visiting here
will recommend to President Clinton and Defense Secretary William J.
Perry that the planned U.S.-Russian maneuvers be held in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Nunn suggested that the National Training Center at Fort Irwin,
Calif. -- or several bases in his home state of Georgia -- might be just
right for the job. Hutchison said she is sure Texas would be pleased
to host the exercises.
</P>
<P>
Russian politicians welcomed the American proposal.
</P>
<P>
``All these hysterics about the exercises in the Totsk firing range
are simply comical,'' said liberal economist Yegor T. Gaidar,
complaining that hard-liners have told people that American troops
would use the opportunity to seize Moscow. ``Nevertheless, the
opposition managed to use this as a pretext for violent anti-Western
propaganda.''
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the United States and Russia first agreed to hold the
maneuvers in Germany. But officials had neglected to consult the
German government, which nixed the idea. Next, the United States
proposed hosting the exercises, but Russia balked at their $2 million
cost.
</P>
<P>
(Optional Add End)
</P>
<P>
Sergei N. Yushenkov, chairman of the Defense Committee of the Duma,
or lower house of the Russian parliament, said the maneuvers' cost
could still be a problem.
</P>
<P>
And he said that members of the far-right party, led by Vladimir V.
Zhirinovsky -- who had at first insisted that the exercises not be held
in Russia -- were already finding new excuses Tuesday to oppose holding
them in America. Zhirinovsky supporters have formed an alliance with
other nationalists, Communists and conservative Agrarian lawmakers.
They often command a majority in the Duma.
</P>
<P>
``They do not want equal partnership (with the West) and they are
not really interested in promoting a stable, firm and reliable
international security system,'' Yushenkov said of the hard-line
opposition.

High grades go to two segments from Wednesday night's latest

dealers sell lethal arms to anybody whose check is good. Not available
for preview: a commentary by Susan Estrich on date rape, stories by
Peter Van Sant on the Filene's Basement annual bridal gown sale in
Boston and by Bill Geist on the ``fingernail industry.'' ``America
Tonight's'' big mistake is a planned weekly, unscientific telephone

 Rosty Charges Another Black Eye for House (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An institution already bruised from a succession of
scandals got another black eye Tuesday with the indictment of Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., and Republicans got a campaign issue for this
year's midterm elections.
</P>
<P>
The 17-count indictment against the powerful Chicago Democrat
embodies the contempt many Americans long have made against Congress,
that its members enjoy perks and privleges not available to ordinary
citizens and have used their positions for personal enrichment rather
than the public good.
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski proclaimed his innocence and vowed to fight the
charges. But many Americans already have found the Congress guilty,
and the case outlined by U.S. attorney Eric Holder Tuesday likely will
feed public cynicism regardless of how the legal battle turns out.
</P>
<P>
``People are going to sit back and watch this trial and say, ``I
always thought that politicians used public office for private gain
and now I know it's true,' '' said Democratic pollster Mark Mellman.
</P>
<P>
``If you multiplied the $600,000 allegedly embezzled (by
Rostenkowski) by 435 members of Congress, you would get an idea of how
big this is in the eyes of the taxpayers,'' said Rep. Ernest J. Istook
Jr., R-Okla., who won his seat two years ago by defeating a
scandal-ridden Republican in the primary. ``Rightly or wrongly, it
gives fuel to people who believe that everybody in Congress is a
crook.''
</P>
<P>
That cynicism has put incumbents on the defensive, spawned the term
limits movement in America and helped to give rise to Ross Perot and
his followers. Even before Tuesday's indictment, incumbents were
nervous about the voters' mood this year.
</P>
<P>
The assault on Congress's image has come in many forms over the
past five years: the scandals over the House bank and post office; the
resignation under a cloud by former speaker James C. Wright, D-Texas;
a stream of television reports on the junkets and goodies enjoyed by
those in office.
</P>
<P>
Polls continue to show an overwhelmingly negative view of Congress
as an institution. Four in five voters say members of Congress quickly
lose touch with people back home and three in five disapprove of the
job Congress does.
</P>
<P>
The fallout of declining public confidence in Congress -- and of
demands for ever-stricter ethics laws and tigher regulations on public
behavior -- also have led to a record number of resignations by House
incumbents over the past two election cycles, and Republicans signaled
Tuesday they would try to make Rostenkowski part of their arsenal of
attack against Democrats this fall.
</P>
<P>
``It's more than an indictment of a man, it's an indictment of a
system of political boss control of Congress for 40 years,'' said Rep.
Bill Paxon, R-N.Y., chairman of the National Republican Congressional
Committee. ``Nothing's going to change in Congress until the public
changes the party in control.''
</P>
<P>
Paxon said Rostenskowski ``absolutely'' will be an issue in the
fall campaigns. ``It already is a key part of the fall message,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
But freshman Rep. Peter Deutsch, D-Fla., a former state legislator,
said that voters are not likely to hold any one party responsible for
political corruption when members from both parties have had their
problems.
</P>
<P>
``This fall, I think the attitude will be ``a plague on both your
houses,''' said Deutsch. ``This indictment is a personal tragedy for
Rostenkowski and it's not good for Americans to have this kind of
cynicism (about their government). But just as I think the impact of
the indictment on health care reform will be zero, the impact on other
races around the country will also be zero.''
</P>
<P>
But the indictment put Democratic leaders in a particularly
difficult position because of their conflicting desires to show
loyalty to a man who is both enormously powerful and highly popular on
Capitol Hill and to protect the image of the institution.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., and House Majority Leader
Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., issued cautious statements underscoring
their respect for the House Ways and Means Committee chairman and
reminding the public that he is innocent until proven guilty. But
their statements were more telling for their brevity, as if the less
they said the less likely the public would try to connect Rostenkowski
to other Democrats.
</P>
<P>
Other Democrats tried to show sympathy for Rostenkowski: ``It hurts
in the legislative sense and it hurts in the personal sense,'' said
Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. ``This is not just an ordinary member
getting into trouble, but one who was very respected.''
</P>
<P>
But privately some Democrats were gloomy about the fallout and
candid about the demoralizing effect of the indictment. ``Everyone's
going to run away from him like crazy,'' one House Democrat said.
``This is a no-winner.''
</P>
<P>
Gephardt tried to draw a parallel with the indictment of Rep.
Joseph McDade, R-Pa., as evidence that the Rostenkowski damage will be
limited. ``The (Republican) minority has had a ranking member of the
Appropriations Committee under indictment and it hasn't impaired their
ability to say anything,'' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
But Frank Luntz, who polls for Republicans, said the indictment
itself will ``allow Republicans to point the finger at another major
Democrat'' and make it easier for Republicans to make ``the case for
change'' this fall.
</P>
<P>
With more incumbents running for reelection, Democrats may pay a
higher price for the perceived sins of the institution, but even some
Republicans acknowledged that the public may not make much a
distinction between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
``As a Republican, I don't take any joy in this because I think it
will reflect badly on the whole institution,'' said freshman Rep.
Michael Castle, R-Del. ``My impression is that Congress's image had
begun to improve in the last year or so, and then this happens... .
This reflects on everybody to some degree.''

 Clinton Visits Italy to Salute WWII Victory Over Fascism (Rome) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Launching a nostalgic pilgrimage to salute the World War II
victory over fascism, President Clinton flies Wednesday into a
swirling, bitter European controversy with echoes from those desperate
days half a century ago: Are the political heirs of Benito Mussolini
trustworthy partners in a new Italian government?
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, a billionaire businessman on the
defensive over the inclusion of neo-fascists in his two-week-old
government, pledged anew on Tuesday that there was no threat to
democracy.
</P>
<P>
In a 50-minute meeting, Berlusconi reassured a delegation from the
Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles that he would support their
call for the extradition from Argentina of Nazi war criminal Erich
Priebke.
</P>
<P>
``Berlusconi said he was personally committed to see Priebke
brought to trial in Rome,'' said Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean
of the center who headed the delegation. ``I spoke directly about
concerns over neo-fascists in government, and I was very satisfied
with Berlusconi's responses.''
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrives around midnight for his first visit to Rome, a
planned-to-the-minute extravaganza that will include talks Thursday
with Berlusconi and a meeting with Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the president delivers a major address at the American
military cemetery in Nettuno, south of Rome. Clinton will honor
soldiers who died in fighting after the 1944 amphibious landing at
Anzio, one of the savage battles that marked the beginning of the end
of World War II. On Saturday, the 50th anniversary of the liberation
of Rome, Clinton flies to England, and continues to France for D-Day
ceremonies on Normandy beaches Monday.
</P>
<P>
In assaying the new-look government of one of its closest allies,
the United States has proved more sanguine about the five neo-fascist
members of Berlusconi's Cabinet than Italy's partners in the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
``Berlusconi has been elected. Let's see if he knows how to do his
job. Let's give him a chance and support him,'' Clinton told Italian
reporters in Washington in an interview televised over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The 57-year-old self-made tycoon, one of Europe's richest men,
entered politics in January, led a right-wing electoral alliance to
victory in March and won confirmation by Parliament in mid-May. Since
then, however, Berlusconi has been repeatedly rebuffed by European
partners for the neo-fascist elements in his coalition, and
discomfited by allies at home in his efforts to effectively launch
Italy's first right-wing government since the war.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, in the latest of a long line of incidents, Socialist
Party members of the European Parliament asked conservative colleagues
to help bar neo-fascists from joining the assembly after European
elections later this month.
</P>
<P>
Returned to office after more than four decades as pariahs on the
extreme right-wing of the many-splendored Italian political universe,
extremists among the neo-fascists are in full cry -- to the
embarrassment of Berlusconi and National Alliance leader Gianfranco
Fini.
</P>
<P>
``The National Alliance condemns any totalitarianism and certainly
does not propose a model for a totalitarian or despotic state,'' Fini
told Italian state radio over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Fini, a slick, 42-year-old professional politician, has made
neo-fascism politically acceptable. But he also triggered a storm
after the election by declaring that Mussolini was the century's
greatest statesman. He says he was quoted out of context.
</P>
<P>
Many of Berlusconi's ministers are more technocrat than politician,
and in the economic and international arenas they are well-respected.
Foreign Minister Antonio Martino, a university professor, won high
marks on confidence-building visits to Washington and Brussels.
</P>
<P>
``I'm sure there will be no difficulty in collaboration between
Britain and Italy,'' said British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd after
meeting Martino in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe observed: ``I have no reason to
worry, but all that will be judged by actions.''
</P>
<P>
Berlusconi -- who promises a jobs-producing, more efficient
government that is based on free-market economics and is able to pay
its bills -- asks to be evaluated ``on the basis of facts and not on
prejudices.''
</P>
<P>
That was an appeal he made again Tuesday in conversation with the
Wiesenthal Center delegation, which has been pressing for vigorous
Italian action to bring Priebke to trial. The former SS captain has
confessed to being second in command of German soldiers who executed
335 Italian civilians, about 75 of them Jews, at the Ardeatine Caves
south of Rome in 1944.
</P>
<P>
The Wiesenthal delegation gave Berlusconi and Justice Minister
Alfredo Biondi a bulky dossier on Priebke, including a 1946 confession
in which he says he shot at least two people at the caves, Cooper
said.
</P>
<P>
``Berlusconi told us that four days ago that Italy officially
requested of Argentina that Priebke, who is under house arrest, does
not flee,'' the rabbi said. ``When we talked about concerns about
fascism, the prime minister assured us that his ministers harbor no
feelings and no links to the past. The justice minister said he
personally would not serve in any government with any minister who
believed in fascism.
</P>
<P>
``We heard what we hoped we'd hear,'' Cooper said.

it did during the burst of growth at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
From the last three months of 1991 through the first three months
of this year, consumers increased their purchases of goods and
services so significantly -- up 8.5 percent after adjustment for
inflation -- that their spending was the driving force that lifted the
economy out of its post-recession doldrums.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts are welcoming the prospect of slower growth since it
would head off any danger of the economy overheating and triggering a
surge of inflation.
</P>
<P>
The latest sign of cooling came Tuesday when the Commerce
Department reported that consumer spending fell in April an
inflation-adjusted 0.4 percent -- the first monthly drop since the end
of the 1990-91 recession, except for a dip caused by a massive storm
in March 1993.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a number of analysts said sources at department stores
and auto dealers have indicated sales remained flat or perhaps even
fell last month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Conference Board, a New York-based business research
group, said its monthly survey of consumer attitudes found that
households were slightly less confident about their current economic
circumstances in May, and how they expect the economy to look six
months from now. The confidence index dipped from 92.1 in April to
87.6 last month.
</P>
<P>
Robert Diederick, chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago,
said an array of economic figures, including those released Tuesday,
is pointing toward slower overall economic growth for the coming year.
He noted that since the middle of last year, real consumer spending
had been rising at about a 4.5 percent annual rate, a string of gains
that he said ``clearly were unsustainable.''
</P>
<P>
``While the employment gains have been nice recently,'' he said,
other factors have not been so favorable for consumer pocketbooks -- a
sharp decline in the mortgage refinancings that usually give
households extra cash to spend, a low saving rate, last year's
income-tax increase for high-income individuals and overall gains in
personal income which ``has not been rising rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
Diederick said some of these factors are only temporary. ``The
employment gains, and the output gains, will slow after this
quarter,'' with the inflation-adjusted gross domestic product
increasing at a 2.5 percent to 3 percent rate, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Commerce Department said Tuesday that personal incomes
rose in April by a moderate 0.4 percent, leaving them 5.4 percent
higher than they were a year earlier. Personal incomes rose 0.6
percent in March and 1.8 percent in February, when they rebounded from
a January decline due to severe winter weather in the East and an
earthquake in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
New homes sales ran at an annual rate of 683,000 in April compared
with 733,000 in March, the Commerce Department reported. The April
rate -- except for a January figure depressed by the weather -- was the
slowest since August.
</P>
<P>
``Housing will make a positive contribution to second-quarter
growth, merely because the weather hurt construction activity in the
first quarter,'' said F. Ward McCarthy of Stone McCarthy, a
Princeton, N.J., financial-markets research firm. ``But beyond the
second quarter, housing should be neutral or even a slight drag'' on
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
McCarthy's colleague, Ray Stone, said the April consumer spending
figures were only slightly higher than their average for the first
three months of the year, implying that for the second quarter
household purchases probably will be up at an annual rate of about 1.5
percent to 2 percent, following the much larger 4.6 percent rate in
the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Since consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the gross
domestic product, such a small increase in the three months from April
through June ``means it will be difficult to get a GDP (growth) number
much above 3 percent, compared to some forecasts in the 5 percent to 6
percent range,'' Stone said.
</P>
<P>
Fabian Linden, executive director of the Conference Board's
Consumer Research Center, said that ``although confidence retreated in
May, the current reading continues to be at a fairly reassuring level.
Consumers, on balance, remain fairly confident.''
</P>
<P>
However, somewhat fewer respondents described business conditions
as ``good'' and a few more said they were ``bad'' than the month
before.
</P>
<P>
Also, a third of the respondents said jobs are ``hard to get,''
more than had done so in April. Less than half that number said jobs
are ``plentiful.''

 Sen. Warner Says He Might Renounce GOP if North Nominated (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., said he will actively
support an independent Senate bid by fellow Republican J. Marshall
Coleman if Oliver L. North wins the GOP nomination Saturday, and he
may even renounce the party by seeking re-election in 1996 as an
independent.
</P>
<P>
Virginia's senior senator said he has been encouraging Coleman, a
former state attorney general, to mount an independent campaign
because he finds North unfit to hold public office.
</P>
<P>
And although Warner has made no final decision, he said he will not
allow the conservatives who support North to prevent him from running
again in two years.
</P>
<P>
``I will find a way of getting my name in front of the voters of
Virginia,'' he said. ``I hope to do it through the party structure.
But a small, tiny group is not going to stop me.''
</P>
<P>
Warner, the highest-ranking elected Republican in Virginia, will
not attend the party convention in Richmond this weekend; he will be
4,000 miles away on the beaches of Normandy, participating in
ceremonies commemorating the 50th anniversary of D-Day. He said one
Republican activist recently joked to him: ``You're going where the
shooting has stopped.''
</P>
<P>
Warner's blunt remarks are the clearest sign yet that the
ideological schism caused by North's candidacy likely will widen in
coming months. The prospect of a Warner defection in two years could
shatter the party unity fostered by Republican Gov. George Allen's
unexpected victory last fall and throw Republicans into an internecine
war.
</P>
<P>
There also is evidence that Warner commands a much stronger
political position than the hail of criticism directed at him in
recent weeks would suggest.
</P>
<P>
Although GOP conservatives are furious with him for disparaging
North, senior Republicans and Democrats say Warner's popularity with
the general public has soared because of his stand. According to
political strategists, numerous private polls show that most voters
consider his statements gutsy. Warner's current approval ratings are
the highest of any elected official in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
The three-term incumbent certainly doesn't sound worried. In
remarks sure to rile North supporters, Warner said a North victory
could turn this weekend's meeting into a repeat of the party's 1992
national convention, with its stridently conservative tone.
</P>
<P>
``I'm deeply concerned,'' Warner said. ``I hope this convention
will not be compared to that which nominated George Bush in Houston.
Historians point to the Houston convention as the beginning of the
road to his loss.''
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said that even though Coleman has lost two
statewide races since he was elected attorney general in 1977, an
energetic effort by Warner could help make him a serious contender.
</P>
<P>
``John Warner has the ability to transfer some of his popularity to
a centrist Republican candidate like Marshall Coleman,'' said Mark J.
Rozell, a political scientist at Mary Washington College. ``There are
a good many Republicans who are disgruntled with Oliver North. . . .
North has a strong base, but his major problem is broadening that
base. He needs the support of moderates, and Marshall Coleman would
cut into that.''
</P>
<P>
The potential for a donnybrook began building four months ago, when
Warner became the first senior GOP official to publicly criticize
North. On the day North formally declared his candidacy, Warner gave a
round of scathing interviews in which he questioned North's fitness
for the job. ``What is the sign the Virginia Republican Party sends,''
Warner asked, ``when the only person it can find is someone with
(North's) record?''
</P>
<P>
Several weeks later, when former president Ronald Reagan released a
letter criticizing North, Warner played a key role in disseminating
it. Finally, Warner said he could not actively support North under any
circumstances.

 U.S. Missiles Detargeted in Cold War Wind-Down (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age,
the world's two superpowers are no longer in each other's sights.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department announced Tuesday that it had ``detargeted''
all U.S. strategic missiles, matching a similar move by the Russians
and taking global nuclear war off hair-trigger readiness.
</P>
<P>
It added that the British had also detargeted their nuclear weapons
as part of the international effort to step back from nuclear
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Strategic targets in the former Soviet Union and its satellite
states had been programmed into the United States' 1,400 strategic
nuclear delivery systems. With the Kremlin locking its
intercontinental missiles onto key targets in the United States, the
policy that helped keep the peace for decades became known as MAD -- 
mutual assured destruction.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said Tuesday that 50 10-warhead Peacekeeper missiles,
which have a range of 6,000 miles and form the core of the U.S.
land-based nuclear strike force, were no longer programmed with
targeting information. The programmed targeting of the Trident
missiles on 18 Ohio-class submarines, which carry 24 missiles each,
was also erased.
</P>
<P>
The computers on 500 older Minuteman IIIs, housed in silos in North
Dakota and Wyoming, require constant targeting programs. They have now
been targeted to fall into the sea.
</P>
<P>
``Detargeting is an important symbolic point,'' said Kathleen de
Laski, a Pentagon spokeswoman. ``It emphasizes the strengthening
partnership between the U.S. and Russia, a significant milestone which
indicates we are no longer nuclear adversaries.''
</P>
<P>
But she stressed that the weapons could be retargeted quickly to
hit military, political and urban centers, so that neither the United
States nor Russia is at ``a significant disadvantage.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional Add End)
</P>
<P>
Conservative hawks are concerned that the administration might
retreat from the land-, sea- and air-based nuclear forces that have
been the basis of U.S. deterrence for decades.
</P>
<P>
Baker Spring, a nuclear-force expert with the conservative Heritage
Foundation, said: ``What worries me a little bit is whether the
overall (nuclear) force will be in a ready enough state to retain a
retaliatory capability in the most extreme circumstance -- a bolt out
of the blue, presumably from Russia.
</P>
<P>
``The question is, in an unexpected crisis, is the load-up time
(for retargeting the missiles) still long enough that it reflects
retaliatory capabilities. Ultimately, the targeting should be done so
that the United States has the best chance possible ... of reducing to
an absolute minimum the amount of damage that would be done to this
country, in the event deterrence fails.''

 U.S. Plans to Seek Economic Sanctions Against N. Korea (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Clinton administration decided Tuesday that North
Korea is likely to continue to bar required international inspections
at its principal nuclear reactor, and senior U.S. officials began
detailed planning to seek punitive economic sanctions against the
communist nation.
</P>
<P>
In a telex to North Korea Tuesday night, the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) made a last-ditch appeal for the country to halt
its withdrawal of fuel rods from the nuclear reactor, or to follow
acceptable procedures for storing the rods under international
supervision.
</P>
<P>
But at the IAEA's headquarters in Vienna-as well as at the Defense
Department, State Department and White House-there was uniform
pessimism that North Korea would accept the appeal. That consensus
contrasts with a longstanding disagreement among U.S. officials over
whether North Korea has simply been resisting inspection as a
negotiating ploy in hope of gaining concessions from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
In light of the new agreement within the administration, officials
said they expected the United States would have to submit a proposal
for sanctions to the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Washington has threatened such a response if North Korea ruins any
chance to measure the radioactive content of the fuel rods, a
measurement considered critical to determining how much plutonium the
country may have accumulated for nuclear weapons. The CIA has
concluded that North Korea may have a nuclear bomb now, and suspects
it is trying to develop more.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. position has hardened in response to North Korea's
acceleration in recent days of unsupervised withdrawal of the nuclear
fuel rods.
</P>
<P>
A group of senior administration officials, including Secretary of
State Warren Christopher and Defense Secretary William J. Perry, met
Tuesday at the White House to discuss North Korea's action and prepare
for formal diplomatic consultations about sanctions, officials said.
</P>
<P>
``We're very concerned about the situation. We're following it
closely,'' White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said.
</P>
<P>
``The (sanctions) issue is on the front burner,'' an official
familiar with the White House meeting said.
</P>
<P>
Although U.S. officials said they did not see any signs of unusual
North Korean military activity, South Korean president Kim Young Sam
responded to heightened tension over the inspection issue by placing
the country's military forces on a higher level of alert.
</P>
<P>
Kim also telephoned President Clinton to offer his assurances that
South Korea supports the U.S. position on the inspections. Clinton
told Kim the situation has reached ``a very dangerous stage,'' a
spokesman for Kim told reporters in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokeswoman Kathleen DeLaski said ``we are not pleased
with the actions of the North Koreans over the past 48 hours.'' She
said that while the military has ``shortened the time'' needed to
reinforce the 37,000 U.S. troops in South Korea, the United States has
not begun moving additional troops or helicopters to the country in
anticipation of any conflict there.

 Friends Often Recall Old-Style Politics to Explain 
 What Is Happening to Rostenkowski (Chicago) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dan Rostenkowski grew up in a political world far
different from Washington of the 1990s with its independent counsels
and ethics codes.
</P>
<P>
It was this kind of world: In 1963, when Rostenkowski was 35 and in
his third term in Congress, a judge here ordered him to stop using
local Democratic Party funds to pay his constituents' parking tickets.
Rostenkowski thought he was providing a service that also was ``good
politics.''
</P>
<P>
During the two-year investigation that culminated in Rostenkowski's
indictment Tuesday, his friends often recalled that distant and
colorful world of ward bosses and old-style politics to try to explain
what was happening to the 66-year-old House Ways and Means Committee
chairman.
</P>
<P>
The rules of politics had changed over the years, they said, but
stubborn, proud ``Rosty'' was slow to adapt. What was once acceptable
in the ward organizations of Chicago and the backrooms of Congress
could now get a guy in trouble.
</P>
<P>
After the lengthy investigation and days of intense speculation
about a possible plea bargain, Tuesday's announcement of the 17-count
indictment was greeted here with almost a sense of relief. Leading
politicians had little to say except for expressions of sadness and
muted loyalty to their old friend. But few here expressed surprise
over Rostenkowski's decision to reject a plea bargain and fight the
charges in court.
</P>
<P>
``The spectacle of him cutting some sort of deal and slinking off
was not in keeping with people's image of him or Chicago,'' said
political consultant David Axelrod, who worked for Rostenkowski in his
last two campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Rostenkowski seems to personify Chicago's self-image -- big,
broad-shouldered and gruff on the outside, someone who got things
done. At a restaurant in Rostenkowski's district Tuesday afternoon,
owner Charles Schulien called the indicted congressman ``a
heavyweight.''
</P>
<P>
``When you find somebody who can get the God-damned job done, they
want to nail him,'' he said. ``I just hate to see it.''
</P>
<P>
To his critics here, however, Rostenkowski has always personified a
less-savory aspect of the Chicago political tradition. His indictment,
they said, resulted from ``the habits of a lifetime'' that began when
he entered politics in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
``He operated for much of his career as a Chicago ward heeler,''
said Don Rose, a veteran of the political-reform movement that has
battled the regular Democratic organization for generations. `` ...
It's almost like they don't know the difference between right and
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
``There is no question he is of another era in which politicians
went out and tried to accomplish things and didn't spend countless
hours poring over poll data to decide which tie to wear that day,''
Axelrod said. ``The politics he grew up with were much more focused on
results rather than appearances.''
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski has never cared much about appearances. The quality he
has always valued most and prided himself on is loyalty -- to his
family, which he shielded from the glare of publicity; to his city,
which he showered with federal largesse from his powerful
congressional post; and to his party, which expected his loyalty and
rewarded him in return.
</P>
<P>
It is how he learned the game of politics in his hometown.
Rostenkowksi's father, Joe, was for three decades the undisputed boss
of Chicago's 32nd Ward. There he was the alderman and Democratic ward
committeeman, which gave him control of the ward's patronage. Known as
Big Joe Rusty, the elder Rostenkowski in 1952 was accused by the
Chicago Daily News of having three ``no-show'' employees on his
payroll, a charge that more than 40 years later would be leveled
against his son.
</P>
<P>
Defeated in the 1955 Democratic primary, Big Joe Rusty was rewarded
for his loyalty by the city's newly elected mayor, Richard J. Daley,
who named him superintendent of sewer repairs. A few years later, a
Daley critic on the City Council said he was ``unable to find any
evidence that Rostenkowski does any work for the city.''
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, real political power in cities like Chicago was at
the local level. That is where the jobs were, where friends could be
rewarded and enemies punished. But with a foresight he later
demonstrated as Congress's consumate dealmaker, Rostenkowski, then a
state senator, set his sights on Washington.
</P>
<P>
Daley and the other party bosses considered Washington something of
a political backwater, but Rostenkowski used the Southern example to
help persuade them otherwise. Southern Democrats, he argued, dominated
the congressional committee system because they were elected to
Congress when they were young, rose through the seniority system and
in later years controlled the committees that dispensed money and
power from the nation's capital to the states and cities. Why
shouldn't we do the same? Rostenkowski asked.
</P>
<P>
Daley agreed. And so in 1958, running in an ethnic district that
was as politically safe as the most entrenched Southern Democratic
barony, Dan Rostenkowski was elected to Congress.
</P>
<P>
For much of his congressional career, Rostenkowski struggled to
overcome his ``Chicago ward heeler'' image, finally succeeding when he
became House Ways and Means Committee chairman in 1980. He became a
national figure, someone with ``clout,'' a word that Chicago
contributed to the political lexicon.
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski funneled millions of dollars in federal funds to his
hometown, just as he had planned decades earlier. And as his legal
troubles deepened, the city's political and business establishments
rallied to his side, helping him win 50 percent of the vote in a
three-candidate race in the Democratic primary in March.
</P>
<P>
``It was sell, but not a tough sell,'' Cook County Democratic Party
Chairman Thomas G. Lyons said of that campaign. ``All you had to do
was remind voters of what this guy has meant.''
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski's Republican opponent in November, Michael Flanagan,
is a political unknown who is still given little chance of defeating
the indicted incumbent in the overwhelmingly Democratic district. Even
his severest critics recognize Rostenkowski's legislative ability and
his importance to this city.
</P>
<P>
``He's one of those tragic figures,'' Rose said. ``This is a guy
who has qualities. This is a man of value. It's almost Aristotelian -- 
the tragic flaw.''

 Prominent Briton Exposed in Family Affairs (London) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The British political scene was buzzing Tuesday with its
latest scandal and its bewildering batch of elements.
</P>
<P>
Alan Clark, the 66-year-old patrician who once was a favored member
of Lady Thatcher's government, was accused of having overlapping
affairs with the wife of a British judge and her two daughters.
</P>
<P>
Clark -- the son of Lord Clark, who was ennobled in his role as the
art historian who created the television series ``Civilization'' -- saw
his own hopes of resuming his political career in the House of Lords
dashed Tuesday because of the disclosures.
</P>
<P>
In his best-selling ``Diaries'' last year, the younger Clark
produced fascinating insights into the workings of ministers in a
Conservative government, while at the same time admitting to a career
of pursuing women outside his marriage. His book included allusions to
a ``coven,'' an assembly of witches, among his women friends. He gave
the first names or nicknames of three: the mother Valerie, and her two
daughters, Alison and Josephine.
</P>
<P>
It has now been disclosed that Valerie was married for a second
time to an English judge, James Harkess. After retirement, he moved to
South Africa. One of her daughters, Josephine, now 34, remains close
to them in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The other daughter, Alison, 36, is estranged and lives with former
KGB agent Sergei Kausov. He is the former husband of Greek shipping
heiress Christina Onassis, who died in 1988.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the top-selling tabloid, News of the World, owned by
Rupert Murdoch, published a story by the women admitting to the
affairs with Clark; the judge said he supported the allegations. The
reason they spoke out, they said, was to ``tell the truth, to set the
record straight.''
</P>
<P>
``I feel that certain people in the present government and the
recent government are rotten to the core,'' said Harkess, ``and I
think this should be brought out.'' Harkess was reported to be
politically opposed to Prime Minister John Major, a moderate
Conservative by Harkess' standards.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Harkess said she realized, after her 14-year-affair with
Clark, including a period when she knew her lover had had sex with her
daughters, that he was a ``pathetic, lecherous, dirty old man.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional Add End)
</P>
<P>
After the Harkess family landed in London Tuesday, bankrolled by
the News of the World, Clark admitted: ``I deserved to be horse
whipped.'' But he denied allegations by the Harkesses that he had
offered the family $150,000 to keep them from taking their story to
the newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jane Clark, the millionaire's wife, whom he married when
she was just 17, told reporters she knew of her husband's
peccadilloes, declaring: ``Quite frankly, if you bed people I call
`below-stairs class' they go to the papers, don't they?''
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Clark, 52, has admitted in the past to throwing an ax at her
husband after being informed of his latest escapade. Of her husband's
girlfriends, she said: ``I think they are dreadful. They all have
their `sell-by' date on them. They all get put away on the shelf in
the end.''

 Court Rules Public Employer Who Wants to Fire Worker 
 Must First Investigate Episode (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that a public employer
who wants to fire a worker because of alleged insubordinate remarks
must first investigate the episode. It marks the first time the court
has given procedural rights under the First Amendment to public
employees whose speech may be disruptive.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the justices reaffirmed the broad power of
federal, state and local governments to restrict employees' speech.
The court said a boss can fire a public employee for remarks -- as they
had been overheard and reported by other workers -- as long as the boss
reasonably believes they constituted insubordinate speech.
</P>
<P>
It does not matter, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote, if it later
emerges that the worker was commenting on matters of public concern
and that the statements were protected by the First Amendment,
provided some investigation occurred.
</P>
<P>
``(T)he extra power the government has in this area comes from the
nature of the government's mission as employer,'' O'Connor said.
``When someone who is paid a salary so that she will contribute to an
agency's effective operation begins to do or say things that detract
from the agency's effective operation, the government employer must
have some power to restrain her.'' That part of the ruling was 7 to 2.
</P>
<P>
Justice John Paul Stevens, joined by Harry A. Blackmun, wrote in a
dissent that the majority view ``underestimates the importance of
freedom of speech for the more than 18 million civilian employees of
this country's federal, state and local governments, and subordinates
that freedom to an abstract interest in bureaucratic efficiency.''
</P>
<P>
Yet, O'Connor's opinion does offer government workers more
protection than they had before Tuesday's ruling in Waters v.
Churchill. She said a public employer who is presented with a report
of disruptive remarks ``must tread with a certain amount of care.''
She was not specific about what kind of investigation was required.
``Many different courses of action will necessarily be reasonable,''
she said. That part of the decision was effectively 6 to 3.
</P>
<P>
Justice Antonin Scalia -- who otherwise joined O'Connor's judgment
in the case arising from a nurse's comments in a Macomb, Ill.,
hosptial cafeteria -- lashed out at the unprecedented requirement of an
investigation, saying it was ambigious and would burden employers and
the courts. He was joined by Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence
Thomas.
</P>
<P>
O'Connor's opinion was signed in full by Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices David H. Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
As the dust settled Tuesday, many legal experts said public workers
had fared better than employers. The court already had said public
employers may fire workers whose speech is disruptive.
</P>
<P>
Yet, this is the first time that the court has said the First
Amendment imposes procedural requirements on the employer. Solicitor
General Drew S. Days III had argued in a friend of the court brief
that the government needs great discretion over its personnel affairs
and that adoption of procedures ``would conflict with the common-sense
realization that government offices could not function if every
employment decision became a constitutional matter.''
</P>
<P>
The ruling is likely to especially benefit state and local public
workers. Many federal workers, according to government lawyers,
already are entitled to a disciplinary investigation under various
statutes.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's case arose from complaints by nurse Cheryl Churchill
seven years ago at the McDonough District Hospital and her subsequent
firing. Administrators, who were told by other nurses that Churchill
``was knocking the (obstetrics) department,'' claimed Churchill was
denigrating the hospital and her superiors. Churchill insisted she was
voicing legitimate concerns about patient care and staff shortages.
</P>
<P>
A federal district court held that neither version of the
conversation rose to the level of a ``public concern'' and therefore
was not protected by the First Amendment. But the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the 7th Circuit reversed, ordered a jury trial to
determine whether Churchill's comments were merely disruptive griping
or a matter of public concern, that is, nursing care.
</P>
<P>
The appeals court ruled that a public employer is liable when it
fires an employee who engages in the latter type of speech, even if
the employer, after staff interviews, had believed otherwise at the
time of dismissal.
</P>
<P>
In rejecting that standard, the Supreme Court said Tuesday it is
enough that the public employer reasonably investigate the complaint
and believe it to be true.
</P>
<P>
While Stevens and Blackmun dissented from O'Connor's opinion, they
effectively endorsed the principle of an investigation into complaints
about public-employee speech.
</P>
<P>
Scalia, Kennedy and Thomas countered that employers should be able
to fire workers unless the action is in retaliation for some
constitutionally protected speech. Scalia mocked O'Connor's approach
as ``strange jurisprudence indeed,'' conflicting with employers'
legitimate prerogatives.
</P>
<P>
``In the present case, for example, if (it were discovered) that
nurse Churchill had not been demeaning her superiors, but had been
complaining about the perennial end-of-season slump of the Chicago
Cubs, her dismissal, erroneous as it was, would have been perfectly
OK,'' Scalia said.
</P>
<P>
The court sent Churchill's case back to a lower court, saying it
should resolve whether she was fired because of her statements in the
cafeteria or because of something else. It noted that Churchill
alleged that management was hostile to her because of earlier
criticism.

 Gibbons, House Panel Try to Continue Work on Health Reform Plans 
 (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla., took command Tuesday of a
House Ways and Means Committee shaken by the multi-count indictment of
its longtime chairman, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., and immediately
ordered the staff to continue working on a health care bill that would
expand Medicare to cover millions of uninsured Americans.
</P>
<P>
In a phone call from Normandy, where he is attending ceremonies
marking the 50th anniversary of D-Day, Gibbons told committee aides to
prepare a ``chairman's mark'' -- or first draft -- using the
subcommittee-approved Medicare expansion bill that so far has failed
to win enough Democratic votes to clear the full committee.
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski, who was forced because of his indictment to step
aside, also was using that measure as his starting point, but even
White House officials had been uncertain whether Gibbons might have an
alternative approach in mind. In the past, Gibbons has supported a
single-payer Canadian style system that has been rejected by the
administration.
</P>
<P>
Under House Democratic caucus rules, the 74-year-old Tampa
legislator, who parachuted into France on D-Day, becomes acting
chairman of Ways and Means unless 50 Democrats file a petition
challenging him. No sign of such a revolt appeared Tuesday and senior
Democrats said they expected Gibbons to go unchallenged.
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski, who rejected plea bargaining, will remain a member of
the committee, but its members said they were uncertain how much
influence he will retain. Some spoke of a virtual division of labor
between Gibbons and Rostenkowski while others predicted the Floridian,
who even before Rostenkowski's indictment publicly expressed his
eagerness to take over, will reject any notion of power-sharing.
</P>
<P>
Senior White House aides said Tuesday night they had not talked to
Gibbons and were uncertain of his plans.
</P>
<P>
But in the telephone interview Tuesday, Gibbons said his starting
point for committee deliberations when Congress returns next week will
be the bill drafted by Rep. Fortney ``Pete'' Stark, D-Fla., and
reported from Stark's Ways and Means health subcommittee on a shaky
6-5 vote last month.
</P>
<P>
Committee sources and White House aides said Rostenkowski had found
himself at least one vote short of the necessary 20 votes to move some
variant of the Stark bill to the floor, because at least five of the
24 committee Democrats were refusing to support the big expansion in
Medicare rolls.
</P>
<P>
Gibbons said Tuesday that he favors requiring employers to help pay
for their workers' health insurance because it would make the system
``fairer.'' These employer mandates have been one of the most
controversial parts of President Clinton's plan.
</P>
<P>
Gibbons said he did not know how much taxes he might have to raise
and what kind of taxes to use because the committee is still waiting
for financial projections from the Congressional Budget Office.
Rostenkowski had said he was facing a $50 billion gap, but the White
House has balked at imposing any broad taxes.
</P>
<P>
Gibbons, rejecting the administration argument that an employer
mandate differs from a tax, said, ``Ultimately, all those costs come
out of the cash pay of the employees.''
</P>
<P>
Gibbons said he does not think the federal government needs to
mandate participation in alliances, the health care purchasing
cooperatives that are central to Clinton's health plan. States should
be allowed to decide the role of the alliances, as the subcommittee's
version of the bill proposes, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Gibbons has expressed strong skepticism about the
cost-saving potential of managed competition, which seeks to control
costs through competition among private insurers. The direct cost
controls included in the subcommittee bill make him more confident
that managed competition would reduce spending on health care, Gibbons
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Gibbons said he favors including coverage of abortions ``in all
cases'' in the standard package of health benefits that insurers would
be required to provide. On that issue, he appears to have changed his
thinking since an interview with The Washington Post last September,
when he said, ``I do not want to pick up the abortion bills in health
care.''
</P>
<P>
Unlike Rostenkowski, Gibbons has not had a long or close
relationship with Clinton. ``He calls me Sam, but so do a lot of other
people. He recognizes me and calls me Sam,'' Gibbons said last
September.
</P>
<P>
``I don't have any qualms about me being able to lead,'' Gibbon
said. ``I've been a leader all my life -- in the Boy Scouts and ROTC
and the army. And I've been successfully elected for -- e had so many
opponents I can't even name them all or count them all.''
</P>
<P>
Democrats and Republicans on Ways and Means expressed confidence in
Gibbons' leadership while acknowledging that the loss of
Rostenkowski's chairmanship makes a difficult legislative task even
tougher.
</P>
<P>
``The hill got a lot steeper,'' said Rep. Mike Kopetski, D-Ore.
</P>
<P>
In private comments, several Ways and Means Democrats said that
Gibbons' brusqueness, what one called his ``eruptions'' of anger,
contrasted unfavorably with Rostenkowski's discipline and doggedness.
Some also said they had been offended by Gibbons' blunt dismissal of
Rostenkowski, with comments like ``the graveyard is full of
``indispensable' people.''
</P>
<P>
``Directness is a part of my character,'' Gibbons said Tuesday.
``If it is abrasive to anyone, I would certainly seriously consider
modifying it.''
</P>
<P>
Rep. Mike Andrews, D-Tex., said, ``No personality is bigger than an
issue, and this is the largest issue most of us on the committee have
ever faced.''
</P>
<P>
Rep. Barbara B. Kennelly, D-Conn., said, ``After all these years,
Mr. Gibbons is finally in the chairmanship, and he will want to
demonstrate he can get a bill out.''
</P>
<P>
Like others, Kennelly said she was uncertain about the new
relationship between Rostenkowski and Gibbons in his new role as
acting chairman. But she noted that Rostenkowski was more sympathetic
than Gibbons to the managed competition approach suggested by Clinton,
which relies in part on market forces to control costs and aid health
care consumers.

 Saudi Dissidents Launch Media Campaign (Cairo) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
CAIRO, Egypt
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of Saudi dissidents seeking to transform
what they call a tyrannical Saudi government into a ``true'' Islamic
state have set up shop in London, charging they were forced into exile
by repression at home.
</P>
<P>
The Committee for the Defense of Legitimate Rights represents the
first time in recent memory that dissidents from within Saudi Arabia's
Sunni Muslim majority have started activities abroad. Although there
is no evidence they have broad support within the kingdom, their
activities could prove embarrassing to the secretive Saudi monarchy,
which tries to keep its rifts behind closed doors and prides itself on
religious orthodoxy and its role as custodian of Islam's holiest
shrines at Mecca and Medina.
</P>
<P>
Only six months ago, King Fahd reached a deal with exiled leaders
of the country's 15 percent Shiite Muslim minority under which they
halted anti-government activities from London and Washington in
exchange for increased civil liberties at home and promises to address
Shiite complaints of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
Since opening its London office in April, the Sunni dissident group
has kept up a steady stream of faxes to news agencies that have
accused the government, among other things, of following ``confused
and irrational'' foreign policies and of ``lavish spending ... in
support of oppression and tyranny.''
</P>
<P>
``This is a fake Islamic government,'' said committee spokesman
Muhammad Masaari, a former physics professor.
</P>
<P>
The group was banned by Saudi authorities shortly after its
establishment in Riyadh last year, and most observers say its chances
of attracting wide support at home are blunted by the pervasiveness of
the Saudi welfare state and a web of business partnerships that link
the royal family to the country's elite.
</P>
<P>
``I don't think this group has done enough conceptual work to offer
ideas and make themselves acceptable to outsiders,'' said a Saudi
analyst. Although they are demanding more accountability from Saudi
rulers, ``their ideas on some social issues, such as women, are more
orthodox than the regime's.''
</P>
<P>
But the group appears to have several factors that could give it
weight, including financial backing and connections within the Saudi
bureaucracy. Most importantly, it draws support from disaffected Sunni
professionals and clergy who have grown outspoken about human-rights
abuses and corruption since the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi government dismissed the significance of the group's
London operations. ``This will not change the stability of the
kingdom, and it is nothing which worries us,'' said Deputy Information
Minister Shehab Jamjoon.
</P>
<P>
Masaari was fired from his job at Riyadh's King Saud University and
jailed for six months after helping set up the dissident committee
last year. In April, he fled Saudi Arabia despite being forbidden to
travel abroad.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to discover how he left the country and pressure him
and fellow dissidents to discontinue their activities, Saudi
authorities arrested Masaari's stepson, a brother, a cousin and two
brothers-in-law, he said. In a separate interview from Riyadh,
Masaari's American wife, Lujain Imam, said her 5-year-old child by a
former Saudi husband was taken from her by his father with the support
of Saudi police.

 Japan Accuses U.S. of Unfair Trade Practices in New Report (Tokyo) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Japan on Tuesday released a report accusing the United
States of unfair trade practices, yet another indication of its
continued tough stance toward American trade demands.
</P>
<P>
``The United States is without parallel in imposing measures that
force its trading partners to abide by unilateral judgments, and shows
no sign of abandoning this practice,'' charges the 333-page report,
which also summarizes alleged unfair practices by nine other major
trading partners of Japan.
</P>
<P>
The report, prepared by an advisory committee under the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry, harshly criticizes President
Clinton's reinstitution in March of the ``Super 301'' trade law, which
allows U.S. retaliation against Japanese imports if Japan fails to
further open its market to foreign goods.
</P>
<P>
``When the same country serves as both prosecutor and judge, one
must assume that due process is lacking,'' the report declares.
</P>
<P>
This is the third year Japan has produced this kind of report,
which serves as a counterattack against an annual U.S. report on
foreign trade barriers. A U.S. report released March 31, which singled
out Japan for the most severe criticism, could ultimately lead to
sanctions. The Japanese report, in turn, lists more categories of
unfair practices by the United States than by any other country.
</P>
<P>
Taken together, the two reports show how officials of the two
countries continue to largely talk past each other when discussing
trade.
</P>
<P>
The underlying theme of the Japanese report is that trade issues
should be settled according to international rules as embodied in the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, and its successor,
the World Trade Organization, or WTO. But U.S. complaints about trade
barriers in Japan primarily concern features of Japan's economic
structure that are not covered by GATT rules.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo and Washington agreed last week to resume trade talks that
had broken down in February, but basic conceptual disputes between the
two sides remain unresolved. From the U.S. perspective, the purpose of
the talks is to agree on ways to further open Japan's market so as to
reduce Japan's $60 billion merchandise trade surplus with the United
States and its $131 billion global surplus in trade of goods and
services.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese report, however, dismisses core U.S. arguments in
almost condescending terms. It is especially critical of demands to
address detailed ``microeconomic'' issues as a means of redressing
trade imbalances. In the trade ``framework'' talks now being resumed,
a key American focus is on specific sectors, including automobiles and
auto parts, insurance, and government procurement of
telecommunications and medical equipment. These sectoral talks
formally resume Wednesday with insurance negotiations in Tokyo, while
auto talks reopen Thursday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Yet Tuesday's report rejects the conceptual basis for these talks.
``A quick perusal of almost any economics textbook will confirm that
microeconomic policies for individual sectors are not effective means
of resolving trade imbalances,'' it says. The report also states that
``in purely economic terms there is no need to resolve ... trade
imbalances.''
</P>
<P>
The report's charges of U.S. discrimination against foreign
competitors run the gamut from unfair enforcement of anti-dumping
actions to patent law.
</P>
<P>
Some complaints are remarkably detailed. The report charges, for
example, that U.S. restrictions on the export of logs cut from federal
forests, imposed to protect the endangered spotted owl, are a
violation of GATT rules. While log exports are restricted, lumber
exports are encouraged, it charges, suggesting that WTO dispute
settlement procedures could be invoked to demand a change.

 Rostenkowski Kept Chicago-Ward-Boss Ways in Congress (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In many respects, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski never left
Chicago and its political folkways, despite spending nearly 36 years
in Congress and achieving a lasting national legacy for his role in
helping to overhaul U.S. income tax laws in 1986.
</P>
<P>
A towering bear of a man who could intimidate his colleagues,
Rostenkowski's brusque style reflected the blunt, take-no-prisoners
politics practiced in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
``You might as well kick a guy's brains out if he's not for you,''
the Democratic congressman once said in a typical bit of Chicago
street talk.
</P>
<P>
So the aggressive ``Rosty'' was doing what comes naturally when he
decided to go to the mat with federal prosecutors rather than holler
``uncle'' and accept a plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski, who dominated the House Ways and Means Committee as
its chairman for more than a decade, earned top marks as a legislative
achiever. Driven by a passion for political power, the 66-year-old
lawmaker hoped to climax his career by playing a leading part in
passage of health care legislation that would add to his reputation
for accomplishments against the odds.
</P>
<P>
Instead, his dream has soured as he has spent much of this year
trying to retain some measure of dignity in a Washington world where
he never seemed fully at home.
</P>
<P>
As Ways and Means chairman, he was one of the most powerful men in
government, shaping policy on taxes, Social Security, Medicare,
welfare and trade.
</P>
<P>
Probably his proudest accomplishment was passage of the 1986 tax
law, which reduced the top income tax rate to 28 percent and
eliminated many tax preferences for business. As part of that campaign
for tax fairness, he appeared on television, urging listeners to
``write Rosty'' if they favored the plan.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Rostenkowski's reputation suffered because of his
unashamed appetite for perquisites, including steak dinners at
lobbyists' expense and invitations to free golfing trips at some of
the nation's top resorts.
</P>
<P>
``In my hometown of Chicago they call politics a blood sport,'' he
once said. ``I don't apologize for getting in the arena and I'll be
damned if I apologize for winning.''
</P>
<P>
He was also true to his roots on another issue. As the city's late
mayor, Richard J. Daley, once declared: ``Chicago ain't ready for
reform.''
</P>
<P>
Neither was Rostenkowski.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
While other lawmakers pretended that they did not want a pay
increase, Rostenkowski came out for a system whereby a House member
could, within limits, set his or her own salary. Naturally,
Rostenkowski said that he deserved the highest rate of pay because of
his committee chairmanship as well as his ability to deliver benefits
for his constituents.
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski bristled at Congress' increasing requirements for
financial disclosure, limits on members' speaking fees and proposals
to curb free meals and golfing trips financed by lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
The Chicago congressman had few peers when it came to taking free
trips to make speeches before special interest groups at locations
conveniently close to a golf course.
</P>
<P>
During the five years ending in 1991, for example, the veteran
politician took 167 trips at the expense of corporations, universities
and charities -- an average of 34 expense-paid trips a year. His
re-election campaign once paid $1,600 in ``consulting fees'' to five
golf professionals who attended fund-raising events with Rostenkowski
on the golf links.
</P>
<P>
In the 1992 election cycle, Rostenkowski charged his campaign
treasury for $28,422 worth of meals at restaurants and country clubs,
mostly in the Chicago area. At the same time, he was a leader on the
paid lecture circuit, collecting more than $1 million in speaking fees
in a two-year period, keeping the maximum amount allowed under House
rules -- about $50,000 -- and donating the rest to charity.
</P>
<P>
Growing up in the Great Depression in what now would be called a
disadvantaged neighborhood, he learned directly about free-and-easy
machine politics as the son of a Chicago alderman and ward boss who
presided over a Polish-American fiefdom on the city's Northwest side.
</P>
<P>
With his father's clout, it was easy for Rostenkowski to become the
youngest member of the Illinois legislature at the age of 24, the
youngest Illinois state senator at 26 and a member of the U.S. House
of Representatives at 30. Chicago's Democratic Party selected nominees
who breezed to election in the one-party town, assuring a safe House
seat for Rostenkowski for decades.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Although in recent years the machine has began to sputter,
Rostenkowski -- whose possible indictment was the subject of wide
speculation in the press at the time -- got help when he desperately
needed it from ward organizations in March's primary election. They
gave it unquestioningly and overwhelmingly and he won renomination to
another term.
</P>
<P>
On Capitol Hill, he focused at first on the internal politics of
the House, gradually building friendships that might help him later,
keeping Chicago's needs ever in mind. He became known as ``Mayor
Daley's man in Washington,'' although other Democrats in the city
delegation had more seniority.
</P>
<P>
He brought home the bacon to his city and state with such
regularity that even Republican Gov. Jim Edgar endorsed Rosty's
re-election this year when he was in the toughest race of his
political life.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
In 1965, Rostenkowski was rewarded with a seat on Ways and Means,
then under the forceful leadership of Rep. Wilbur D. Mills, D-Ark. For
a decade, until Mills departed after a scandalous encounter with an
exotic dancer from Argentina, Rostenkowski acquired seniority and
familiarity with the arcane tax code.
</P>
<P>
He chafed during the tenure of Rep. Al Ullman, D-Ore., a
knowledgeable but ineffectual leader, and took over the committee's
helm in 1981, passing up a chance to take the third-ranking House
leadership post as majority whip.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
With newly elected Republican Ronald Reagan in the White House, the
rookie chairman made what he later conceded was a serious mistake,
engaging in a ``bidding war'' to see who could cut taxes the most.
Reagan won, the federal government's revenue base was seriously
reduced and Rostenkowski learned a political lesson the hard way as
the House voted with Reagan by a large majority.
</P>
<P>
Working with Reagan and the Republicans, Rostenkowski helped to
preserve the solvency of the Social Security system by making tough
choices to raise payroll taxes.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
As a result of his strong hand, Rostenkowski brokered the complex
deals behind the major tax bills of the 1980s and 1990s. But he
experienced some embarrassing defeats as well.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, for example, six Democrats on Ways and Means joined with
all the Republicans to push through a cut in capital gains taxes that
Rostenkowski fought, both in his committee and on the House floor.
Only hard-nosed tactics by Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell
D-Maine, blocked it from becoming law.
</P>
<P>
Even worse, legislation that Rostenkowski championed to provide
catastrophic health insurance coverage for senior citizens, along with
a surtax on them to pay for it, produced such a strong backlash that
the law was repealed. It was during this seniors' rebellion that a
group of elderly citizens chased the chairman down a Chicago street,
shouting: ``Impeach Rostenkowski.''
</P>
<P>
As Rostenkowski increased his power on the committee, he began to
run the panel like a Chicago ward boss, disbursing benefits and
demanding loyalty in return. Under his system, committee Democrats
caucused frequently to develop a consensus, pledging that each of them
would support the resulting compromise. Rosty took names of defectors,
placing them in his own version of political purgatory.
</P>
<P>
Former Rep. Kent Hance, D-Texas, once deserted the chairman on a
key vote. Shortly afterward on a bus trip where other committee
members sat in front, a seat was marked for Hance next to the toilet.
He got the message that the chairman was not pleased.

 Court Rejects Challenge to Teen Curfew Law (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Supreme Court on Tuesday gave a boost to the
growing number of cities that enforce curfews for teen-agers by
rejecting a challenge to a Dallas law that generally requires people
under 17 to be off the streets after 11 p.m. on weekdays and midnight
on weekends.
</P>
<P>
Without a dissenting vote, the court refused to hear an appeal
filed on behalf of three young people and their parents who said the
city law ``convicts the innocent ... and broadly stifles fundamental
liberties.''
</P>
<P>
Although the court did not explain its decision, in earlier rulings
the justices have said the First Amendment to the Constitution does
not give teen-agers a ``generalized right of social association'' that
permits them to be out after hours. Moreover, official discrimination
based on age is permissible, the court has said.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers in the case said curfews to combat juvenile crime exist in
as many as 1,000 cities, including Atlanta, Boston, Detroit, Houston,
Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
While Tuesday's action is not a binding national ruling, it
strongly suggests the court will not strike down curfews as broadly
unconstitutional. However, some lower courts have invalidated curfews
that do not permit exceptions for teen-agers who work or are
accompanied by their parents.
</P>
<P>
Two other decisions announced Tuesday also restrict First Amendment
rights.
</P>
<P>
In a case that yielded four separate opinions, the high court ruled
that public employers may fire workers whose job complaints could
affect the morale of fellow employees. So long as the manager makes a
``reasonable'' effort to investigate what was said, the manager can
then freely dismiss disgruntled workers to ensure that their
complaints do not ``detract from the agency's effective operation,''
the court said.
</P>
<P>
The case of Waters vs. Churchill, 92-1450, sought to clarify the
free speech rights of public employees, such as teachers, nurses,
police officers and state workers, but it resulted in badly splintered
decision.
</P>
<P>
The First Amendment severely restricts the government's power to
pass laws infringing free speech, but government officials can limit
the free speech rights of their employees.
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday's decision, seven justices agreed only that the nursing
supervisor at a public hospital could dismiss a disgruntled nurse for
her on-the-job griping, so long as the supervisor first made a
``reasonable'' effort to learn who said what to whom.
</P>
<P>
In a separate First Amendment case, the justices allowed
government-sponsored fairs, carnivals and parades to keep out groups
whose message is deemed ``inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
On an 8-1 vote, the justices refused to hear an appeal filed by
anti-abortion activists who claimed their free-speech rights were
violated when they were excluded from a city-sponsored festival.
</P>
<P>
Frankfort, Ky., holds its ``Great Pumpkin Festival'' each October
to bring people downtown for ``fun and entertainment.'' In 1990, a
local anti-abortion group applied for a booth to distribute ``plastic
models of fetuses,'' but fair sponsors deemed such political advocacy
inappropriate. The group denied booths to groups who support abortion
rights, including the Kentucky chapter of the National Organization
for Women.
</P>
<P>
The Kentucky Supreme Court upheld the fair sponsor's authority to
restrict participation to non-political groups, and only Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor voted to hear the appeal in Capital Area Right to
Life vs. Downtown Frankfort, 93-1201.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
In the curfew case, lawyers said the Dallas law may have won
approval in part because it contains so many exceptions.
</P>
<P>
``If a mother is sick, and a kid needs to go get a prescription
filled, who would doubt that he has a constitutional right to be out
doing that?,'' asked ACLU attorney Chris Hansen, who has coordinated
the group's attacks on teen-age curfews.
</P>
<P>
The Dallas curfew was enacted in 1991 but exemptions were added in
1992. For example, it exempts young people who are accompanied by a
parent or guardian, are running an errand, or are out on an emergency.
It also does not apply to those who are traveling for work reasons or
attending a school, religious or civic function. Moreover, young
persons are allowed on the sidewalks in front of their homes or a
neighbor's home.
</P>
<P>
Fines of up to $500 can be assessed against youth who violate the
law, as well as their parents and the owners of establishments who
serve minors after hours.
</P>
<P>
In November, the U.S. Court of Appeals based in New Orleans ruled
that the Dallas law is justified by the city's ``compelling interest''
in reducing juvenile crime and in ``promoting juvenile safety and
well-being.'' It cited statistics showing that murders, assaults and
rapes occur most often between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m.
</P>
<P>
The case of Qutb vs. Bartlett, 93-1571, was dismissed without
comment on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
``I think this means that every major city in this circuit is going
to have a curfew,'' said Bruce Morrow, a Dallas attorney who appealed
the case to the Supreme Court.

 Clinton in Crucial Meeting on North Korea Sanctions (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Clinton and his top national security
officials met Tuesday to consider the potentially volatile question of
whether to seek economic sanctions against North Korea -- a move that
Pyongyang has warned would be regarded as an act of war.
</P>
<P>
Although no final decisions were expected Tuesday, officials said
Clinton wanted a consensus for any future actions by Wednesday night,
when he is scheduled to leave for Europe, where he will help celebrate
the 50th anniversary of D-Day.
</P>
<P>
The flurry of activity came amid growing fears that North Korea may
be removing spent fuel rods from its reactor so rapidly that it is on
the verge of destroying U.N. inspectors' ability to determine if spent
fuel has been diverted to make nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The administration has warned that it considers the ability of the
U.N. inspectors to trace the history of North Korea's nuclear program
a crucial issue in the current dispute. Results of such inspections
could tell for certain if North Korea has built a bomb.
</P>
<P>
The situation has been intensifying for days. In a last-ditch
effort to avert a crisis, the U.N. Security Council urged North Korea
on Monday to preserve all existing evidence of how much nuclear fuel
it may have diverted to a nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
The International Atomic Energy Agency, which conducts the nuclear
weapons inspections on the U.N.'s behalf, is expected to issue a
report this week declaring whether North Korea has destroyed the
agency's ability to tell if Pyongyang ever made nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials say that, if the IAEA reports its efforts have been
blocked, there is little doubt the Security Council will begin
considering the sanctions. The only real question would be how broad
the measures should be and how rapidly they should be imposed.
</P>
<P>
South Korea said Tuesday that North Korea already has removed more
than 4,800 of 8,000 spent fuel rods in the reactor at Yongbyon -- a far
more-rapid pace than Western analysts had expected. Officials say
that, at this rate, it could be only days before the evidence is
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The administration continued to express alarm publicly. ``We're
very concerned about the situation,'' White House Press Secretary Dee
Dee Myers told reporters. But she said Washington still was hoping for
a diplomatic solution.
</P>
<P>
(Optional Add End)
</P>
<P>
A major problem facing the administration is uncertainty whether
China will go along with any new move to impose formal sanctions.
Although the Chinese supported Monday's U.N. appeal, they still are
not ready to go along with sanctions. As a result, the administration
may have tough negotiating to do on how rapidly the sanctions should
be imposed. China wants Washington to fold negotiations about nuclear
issues into broader U.S.-North Korean talks.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials said Tuesday that any decision to push for
sanctions almost certainly would be accompanied by a step-up in the
alert status of U.S. military in the region. In Vienna, North Korean
officials continued to rebuff IAEA demands that U.N. inspectors be
permitted to test the rods that have been removed. Yun Ho Jin,
Pyongyang's representative to the agency, said his government would
not alter its policies anytime soon, but he said that it would set
aside 40 of the spent fuel rods for possible inspection by the IAEA
later. Analysts said the move would be useless.

 Supreme Court Limits Speech of Government Employees (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a ruling that affects the free speech rights of 18
million government employees, the Supreme Court Tuesday tentatively
allowed a city hospital in Illinois to fire a nurse who criticized a
training program.
</P>
<P>
As long as a public employer reasonably believes that its actions
do not violate First Amendment rights, it can fire someone even if it
later turns out that free speech was involved, the court said.
</P>
<P>
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, described after her nomination last
year as a strong defender of First Amendment rights, was one of only
four justices who signed the court's opinion Tuesday. Three others
concurred in the result, while Justices John Paul Stevens and Harry A.
Blackmun dissented.
</P>
<P>
The case involved an appeal by the city-owned hospital in Macomb,
Ill., of a decision by the U.S. appeals court in Chicago that Cheryl
R. Churchill was entitled to ask a jury to reinstate her to a job
helping to deliver babies in the hospital's obstetrics department.
</P>
<P>
Churchill, during a dinner conversation with another nurse at the
hospital, criticized a policy allowing on-the-job training of nurses
from other departments. She also allegedly criticized her supervisor,
which she denied. Witnesses split as to whether she had criticized the
supervisor, but she was fired on charges of insubordination anyway
despite the objections of the doctor in charge of the department who
had been battling with the hospital administration over staffing and
training.
</P>
<P>
While government employees (unlike private employees) have had a
right to make statements about public policy, including nurses'
training, they do not have the right to make statements considered
``disruptive.''
</P>
<P>
The hospital said that because it believed Churchill had criticized
her supervisor -- speech that is not protected by the First Amendment -- 
it had acted in good faith and its judgment should not be questioned.
But the appeals court said that ignorance of the fact that her
statements were constitutionally protected was not a defense and that
the facts should be determined by a jury.
</P>
<P>
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for four justices, said that a
government agency's responsibility to perform its job sometimes
outweighs its employees' First Amendment rights.
</P>
<P>
``When someone who is paid a salary so that she will contribute to
an agency's effective operation begins to do or say things that
detract from the agency's effective operation, the government employer
must have some power to restrain her,'' O'Connor wrote.
</P>
<P>
She ordered the case sent back to a lower court to decide whether
the hospital's assumptions were ``reasonable,'' though she made it
clear that ``reasonable'' should be broadly defined.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Justice Antonin Scalia, joined by Clarence Thomas and Anthony M.
Kennedy, sharply critized the ``reasonable'' requirement as a new
constitutional right, but agreed with other aspects of the opinion.
</P>
<P>
Stevens, joined by Blackmun in dissent, wrote, ``The First
Amendment demands that the government respect its employees' freedom
to express their opinions on issues of public importance.''
</P>
<P>
In other action Tuesday, the court:
</P>
<P>
-- Ruled, 7-2, that the state of Washington could impose minimum
stream flows on a hydroelectric power plant to protect fish.
</P>
<P>
-- Refused, over a dissent by O'Connor, to hear the appeal of a an
anti-abortion group banned from participating in a downtown festival
in Frankfort, Ky.
</P>
<P>
-- Declined to hear a challenge to a ruling that officials in Cobb
County, Ga., must remove a 3-by-5-foot framed panel containing the Ten
Commandments and teachings of Jesus from a wall in the county
courthouse.
</P>
<P>
-- Agreed to decide in an Arizona case whether arrests based on
erroneous computer records are good-faith mistakes that don't
necessarily require throwing out all evidence seized afterward.

 Rostenkowski May Meet His Match in Prosecutor (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although he says he wants his day in court, Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., may well meet his match if Eric H. Holder Jr.,
the prosecutor who obtained his indictment, chooses to try the case
himself several months from now.
</P>
<P>
Holder, 43, the first black U.S. attorney for the nation's capital,
is a tall, stately man with a polished courtroom manner and 18 years
experience in public corruption cases. He also has made a study of how
to appeal to juries.
</P>
<P>
``He understands juries here, and he certainly understands
politicians,'' says a former colleague on the Washington, D.C.,
Superior Court, where Holder served five years before President
Clinton appointed him as Washington's top prosecutor last July.
</P>
<P>
A confident, easygoing man, Holder has said he wants to develop a
better relationship between his office of 300 attorneys, who are
disproportionately white, and the predominantly black population of
the District of Columbia from which juries for his cases are drawn.
</P>
<P>
During his years as a judge, he said he winced at seeing
prosecutors lose trials they should have won mainly because they
failed to relate to jurors. Holder said he plans to correct that in
his new post.
</P>
<P>
He promptly won the respect of his new colleagues when he took over
the Rostenkowski probe after his swearing-in last October. At the
time, Jay B. Stephens, his Republican predecessor, criticized the
Clinton White House for replacing him -- at a time when it was
replacing other U.S. attorneys across the country -- in the midst of a
highly sensitive investigation.
</P>
<P>
Rather than duck the criticism, Holder met it head on. ``The idea
that a Democratic U.S. attorney is going to do something different
than a Republican U.S. attorney is pretty close to ridiculous,'' he
said. Instead of shortening or curtailing the inquiry, he decided to
expand it by asking for the appointment of a new federal grand jury to
replace the old jury, which faced a deadline of Oct. 31, 1993.
</P>
<P>
Despite his short time as top prosecutor, Holder has had ample
experience investigating public corruption. He spent a dozen years as
a lawyer in the Justice Department's public integrity section, where
he had a hand in the Abscam congressional bribery prosecution of
former Rep. John W. Jenrette, D-S.C.
</P>
<P>
``In some ways, I came in as prepared as I could have been because
of my 12 years in public integrity,'' he told The Washington Post
earlier this year. ``I think potentially I'm a better U.S. attorney
now than I was then, from being on the bench for five years and
presiding over hundreds of criminal trials.''
</P>
<P>
Former judicial colleagues said Holder's record was ``pretty middle
of the road,'' neither soft-hearted in his sentencing practices nor
too conservative in espousing ``law and order'' at any human cost.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
The son of a secretary and a real estate agent, Holder spent the
summer of 1974 as a law clerk for the NAACP Legal Defense and
Education Fund and the following summer as a law clerk in the Justice
Department. He received his law degree in 1976 from Columbia
University.
</P>
<P>
A Democrat, he has never been active in local politics, has never
run for public office or played a role in anyone else's campaign, he
told the Senate Judiciary Committee last year on the eve of his
confirmation.
</P>
<P>
Others say they suspect the reason is that Holder is skeptical
about politicians, or that he espouses higher standards than many
officeholders do.
</P>
<P>
In describing the Rostenkowski charges to reporters, Holder said,
``The vast majority of members of Congress are decent and honorable
public officials who work incredibly hard and follow all the rules.''
</P>
<P>
He quickly added, ``But the criminal acts of a few feed the
cynicism which increasingly haunts our political landscape.''

 ANALYSIS: Workers Fret While Economists Debate Inflation `Trigger' 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With nearly 14 million Americans out of work, marooned in part-time
jobs or too disheartened to answer a help-wanted ad, could the United
States be approaching ``full'' employment?
</P>
<P>
Key Federal Reserve officials, along with many on Wall Street,
believe that -- as a practical matter -- the answer is yes: that the
economy has has entered a danger zone where further jobs growth could
set off an upward spiral of inflation.
</P>
<P>
That belief, which has helped justify four interest-rate hikes this
year and may hasten the next one, has sparked a controversy that goes
to the very core of the U.S. economy's capabilities in a world of
changing technology and global business links.
</P>
<P>
``How would an average person in California respond to the notion
that somehow we're growing too fast and have to slow the economy
down?'' asks Lawrence Mishel, research director at the Economic Policy
Institute, a liberal think tank.
</P>
<P>
Critics say the Fed is relying on an outdated world view that has
failed to consider sweeping changes that are likely to keep the lid on
inflation as joblessness shrinks further.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the jobs-versus-prices flap comes at a time when the
labor market, despite significant gains, still has pockets of
distress.
</P>
<P>
While the national unemployment rate in April was pegged at 6.4
percent, that is just an average figure. The experience of regions,
racial groups and industries differs drastically.
</P>
<P>
In California, almost 1.5 million people are looking for work, and
the unemployment rate is 9.6 percent, according to state data. By
contrast, the rate in North Carolina is 3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Nationally, whites enjoy a unemployment rate of 5.6 percent,
according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But the black
unemployment rate is 11.8 percent, and the Latino rate is 10.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
One in three Americans still believes that jobs are ``hard to
get,'' the Conference Board reported Tuesday, a slight increase from
April.
</P>
<P>
Given the disparities of fortune, the question of when to slow the
economy through interest-rate hikes takes on huge personal and
political ramifications.
</P>
<P>
``You'd hate to throw away 500,000 jobs that it might not be
necessary to throw away,'' observes Laurence H. Meyer, an economic
forecaster in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, what Fed officials abhor most of all is the prospect
of inflation, which could unhinge the financial markets and undermine
the entire recovery.
</P>
<P>
They have lately become concerned that the economy is running out
of ``slack'' -- unused factory capacity and available workers. The
jobless rate has been on a downward trend for almost two years,
dipping to 6.4 percent in April from 6.7 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
Factories, meanwhile, have been humming, another sign that the
economy continues to pushing forward at high speed: Operating rates
have churned up to 83 percent, closing in on the traditional inflation
threshold of about 85 percent.
</P>
<P>
As the economy runs out of slack, goes the view, shortages of labor
and materials lead to inflation. And inflation erodes the value of
bonds.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
``What's important is that the country has removed an awful lot of
slack in the economy,'' said Robert Parry, president of the Federal
Reserve Bank of San Francisco, in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Parry doubts that anyone can pinpoint the precise unemployment rate
that triggers inflation, but he suggested it lurks somewhere between 6
percent and 6.5 percent, and probably ``in the higher part of that
range.''
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Therein lies the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Critics say the Fed is counting too heavily on theories hatched in
an entirely different era. Nowadays, they contend in a theory of their
own, a range of new, anti-inflationary forces have transformed basic
economic behavior.
</P>
<P>
``There is no question that this (unemployment) is what the Fed has
been focusing on, and there is no question there are faults in their
methodology,'' said Mickey D. Levy, chief financial economist with
NationsBank in New York.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Corporate cost-cutting, for example, has evolved from a fad to a
new business culture, with major implications for keeping the lid on
prices.
</P>
<P>
Consider hiring practices: By some estimates, one in five jobs
generated during the recovery has been temporary, saving employers
much of the expense of permanent staffers who qualify for full
benefits.
</P>
<P>
Global forces are also at play. More than ever, foreign workers and
factories are ready to meet the needs of U.S. consumers when America
approaches the limits of its own industrial capacity.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
``They're just wrong,'' Robert Pollin, an economics professor at
University of California, Riverside, said of the Fed's worries that
America's falling unemployment rate threatens an inflationary spiral.
``They haven't factored in the downward wage pressures from global
competition.''
</P>
<P>
``If some of the world's best physicists can be hired in Russia for
$100 per month, why should anyone pay a third-rate American physicist
$50,000 a year?'' MIT economist Lester C. Thurow recently asked in the
New York Times.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, economists counseled that an unemployment rate in the
4 percent range was the flash point for inflation.
</P>
<P>
Then came the youthful baby boom, largely unsettled in life,
inexperienced in the workplace and often lacking job skills. Estimates
of the inflationary flash point floated toward a 7 percent
unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
Fast-forward to 1994, and the picture has changed once more.
</P>
<P>
Economists believe the danger zone has has gotten lower, partly due
to a more-experienced work force, and peg it in a range between 6.5
percent and 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
But that range covers a lot of territory: The difference of 1.5
percentage points could be the difference of up to 2 million jobs,
said Ross DeVol, an economist with the WEFA Group in suburban
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
The issue could become even touchier in the coming weeks, in light
of some new signs that the economy is perking along faster than
expected. The Commerce Department recently surprised analysts by
revising upward to 3 percent the nation's growth rate for the first
three months of the year, though reports released Tuesday indicated
that the economy cooled off in April.
</P>
<P>
In any case, this much is agreed upon: A recovery once dubbed
``jobless'' is spewing out new jobs by the hundreds of thousands, and
it is doing so without sparking wage inflation so far.
</P>
<P>
But the Fed is on a course of raising interest rates anyway, a
strategy that will reduce jobs growth in the future: ``To the average
person on the street, I'd guess this doesn't make a lot of sense,''
DeVol said.

 Court Ruling Targets Hydroelectric Projects, Water Quantity (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Supreme Court, in a case with far-reaching
consequences for all privately owned hydroelectric dams, ruled 7-2
Tuesday that states may require hydroelectric projects to keep enough
water in rivers to maintain fish populations, preserve aesthetic
qualities and even ensure recreational uses.
</P>
<P>
The case had pitted the state of Washington, which is home to
dozens of powerful rivers and even more hydroelectric dams, against
the Tacoma City Light, a utility company that would own and privately
operate a massive water project on the Dosewallops River.
</P>
<P>
The state had insisted that the utility forfeit some electric
generating capacity by leaving the Dosewallops at levels that would
allow the continued migration of rare salmon and trout up and down the
stretch of water.
</P>
<P>
But officials from Tacoma City Light had argued that while states
may set standards for water quality, only the federal government,
which regulates privately owned hydroelectric dams, may set standards
for water quantity.
</P>
<P>
But Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the
majority, rejected that argument, calling the distinction between the
quality and quantity of water in a river ``an artificial
distinction.''
</P>
<P>
``In many cases, water quantity is closely related to water
quality; a sufficient lowering of the water quantity in a body of
water could destroy all of its designated uses, be it for drinking
water, recreation, navigation or, as here, as a fishery,'' O'Connor
wrote for the majority.
</P>
<P>
Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia dissented.
</P>
<P>
The ruling could effect hundreds of privately owned dams whose
licenses are due for renewal in the coming years. Already, operating
licenses of some 230 privately owned dams have expired and are
operating pending a licensing review, and dozens more are due to
expire in the next several years.
</P>
<P>
While environmentalists cheered the ruling, the hydropower industry
said it is likely to create uncertainty over federal licensing of
hydropower projects and over who -- federal or state officials -- will
have the final say in issuing operating licenses.
</P>
<P>
``We are very dismayed by the courts decision,'' said Karolyn Wolf,
a spokeswoman for the American Hydropower Association. ``It's left the
industry in the lurch and we feel the ramifications for the industry
will be severe.''
</P>
<P>
The ruling also was seen as broadening states' rights to protect
and preserve their waters from degradation by hydropower projects.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Under the federal Clean Water Act, states are responsible for
designating uses for streams and rivers, such as drinking water, fish
habitat or whitewater recreation. A state must then issue a plan to
ensure that those designated uses are not degraded.
</P>
<P>
While those plans normally set out complex chemical standards that
must be met, the court ruled that states also can enforce standards
expressed in more general terms.
</P>
<P>
In the dispute that prompted Tuesday's ruling, the state of
Washington had designated the Dosewallops as a river capable of
supporting the migration of salmon and steelhead trout, species of
fish that are considered in danger of extinction. If the Tacoma City
Light hydroplant diverted too much water for power generation, the
state argued, the river no longer would be able to meet that
objective.
</P>
<P>
``The ruling shows that water quality and water quantity are
strictly intertwined, and have to be treated together under the Clean
Water Act,'' said Katherine Ransel of American Rivers, a watchdog
group that brought the case before the Supreme Court. ``They're like
love and marriage, you can't have one without the other.
</P>
<P>
``It's also sweeping: the court has ruled that water quality means
much more than some measure in a test tube,'' she said. ``The other
side had argued that that's what states are limited to. The court said
uh-uh.''

 FTC Studies Effects of Possible Macy's-Federated Merger 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Federal Trade Commission has begun assessing the potential
consequences of a possible merger between R.H. Macy Co. and
Federated Department Stores Inc.
</P>
<P>
According to sources, the FTC has sent letters to both retailers,
asking about their operations, particularly in states where the chains
overlap: New York, New Jersey, California, Georgia, Texas and Florida.
</P>
<P>
Spokeswomen for the two retailers declined comment on the inquiry,
which an FTC spokesman refused to confirm or deny.
</P>
<P>
Federated's proposed takeover of Macy's would create the nation's
largest department-store group, with $13.5 billion in sales. Federated
owns Bloomingdale's, Abraham Straus, Stern's and six other chains.
In addition to its flagship operation, R.H. Macy also runs I. Magnin,
Bullock's and smaller specialty stores.
</P>
<P>
Macy's, which has vowed to remain independent, has argued that a
combined entity would lead to fewer suppliers and higher prices.
Conversely, Federated maintains that a merger would result in a more
efficient company that can offer consumers lower prices.
</P>
<P>
Federated has circulated proposals on Wall Street claiming at least
$100 million in cost savings after a merger. The number of A S
locations, for instance, might be scaled back. And overlapping chains
elsewhere, such as in Atlanta, are expected to be sold.
</P>
<P>
But a merger is far from certain, even though Federated is a big
Macy's creditor and plays an important role in shaping Macy's
bankruptcy reorganization, which is expected to be completed by
January.
</P>
<P>
Macy's own proposal to emerge from bankruptcy has, so far, won the
backing of bondholders and suppliers. To wrest control of Macy's,
Federated must still win the backing of other important creditors.
Until Aug. 1, Macy's has the exclusive right to file a reorganization
plan in bankruptcy court.

 Health Care Faces New Uncertainty With Rostenkowski Sidelined(Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Health care, an issue already steeped in heavy
political problems, became a bit more difficult Tuesday with the
indictment of Rep. Dan Rostenkowski.
</P>
<P>
Under the rules of the Democratic caucus, the Illinois Democrat
must immediately step aside as chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee, a prestigious panel with the prime responsibility for
drafting the sweeping health legislation at the top of President
Clinton's agenda.
</P>
<P>
Before any measure can be voted on by Congress, proposals must wend
their way through committees in the House and Senate. Rostenkowski's
loyalty to Clinton and his dealmaking ability were best suited to
getting a comprehensive plan out of the House where other House panels
are either faltering or planning to report out legislation that hasn't
been given much chance of success.
</P>
<P>
Based on the seniority system, Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla., will
automatically step in as acting chairman of Ways and Means. Some
Capitol Hill watchers suggested Tuesday that with Rostenkowski out of
that role, the administration's emphasis may switch to the Senate,
where Sen. Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y., chairman of the Finance Committee,
is trying to forge a bipartisan accord.
</P>
<P>
Democrats on the committee went out of their way to insist that
business will go on, even if it's not as usual. They point to the fact
that Gibbons has already told the Ways and Means Committee staff it
will remain intact and it is expected to continue working on the bill
Rostenkowski has been fashioning even in the final days before his
criminal indictment.
</P>
<P>
``We're more concerned with getting a bill out than with
personalities,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., a senior member of
the committee who has been close to Rostenkowski. ``We made a
commitment to the American people and the president,'' Rangel said.
``We should not complain that we couldn't do it because one of our
members has a personal problem.''
</P>
<P>
House Republicans, who want a much more minimalist bill than the
president or House leaders, hope Rostenkowski's ouster could help
their cause.
</P>
<P>
His predicament ``deals a fatal setback to health care reform
unless the Democrats in the House recognize what the Democrats in the
Senate have recognized, and that is that a bill needs to be
bipartisan,'' said Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn.
</P>
<P>
Even supporters of comprehensive national health care worry that
this is one more setback in a series of problems surrounding this
issue. Without Rostenkowski's skill as a legislative negotiator, they
fear, the health issue could be in for more delays.
</P>
<P>
``Gibbons is no Rostenkowski,'' one former congressional staffer
said. Rostenkowksi is famous for his ability to sit down with members,
find out what their concerns are and craft a bill. ``You could give
him your cards and he would play the hands for you,'' Rangel said.
``You could trust him with your hole card.''
</P>
<P>
Gibbons was described by several political observers as someone who
is rigid once he makes up his mind to something and less of a
compromiser. ``He's not the kind of guy who brings people together,''
one analyst said.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Gibbons, who sat in on many of the health subcommittee sessions
this spring, has had a longstanding interest in health care, and has
supported the subcommittee bill, especially the provision that would
insure the poor and uninsured through an expansion of Medicare. But on
the Ways and Means Committee he has been much more involved in trade
issues as chair of that subcommittee. Committee-watchers say other
than possibly beginning hearings on welfare reform, health care is the
only big item on the committee's plate.
</P>
<P>
What Rostenkowski's role will be as a member but not chairman of
the committee was unclear Tuesday. Some lawmakers suggested just
having him in the room will be important and so they were glad to hear
he will fight the charges rather than accept a plea bargain and resign
from the House. Others said he is likely to be preoccupied with his
legal issues and may not or should not be engaged in the debate at
all.
</P>
<P>
``No one is above the law,'' Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., a member
of the committee, said in a statement. ``Like all citizens, Rep.
Rostenkowski is entitled to his day in court, but under the rules he
must relinquish the chairmanship of Ways and Means Committee. This
rule must be followed both in letter and in spirit.''
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Some health experts suggested that Rostenkowski's role in the
health reform effort has been overemphasized that that the real
problem -- how to pay for such an expansive effort -- remains whether he
is at the helm or not.
</P>
<P>
``We want to do health reform where no one pays and everyone gets
coverage,'' said one health policy expert. ``Health reform is in
trouble because you can't do it for free.''

 U.N. Adds 4 Months in Somalia (UN) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
UNITED NATIONS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council demonstrated growing
impatience with bickering clan leaders in Somalia Tuesday, renewing
the controversial U.N. mission there for only four months and warning
it could wind down the operation in mid-July if there has been no
progress toward peace.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration is bringing to bear on the huge U.N.
mission in Somalia its new, cautious policy on U.N. peacekeeping
approved in early May. U.S. diplomats pressed for the mission to be
renewed for only 45 days. In a compromise, Council members voted 15-0
to the four-month extension instead of the previous six-month periods
and to reassess the mission before the end of July.
</P>
<P>
``This resolution puts those most responsible for obstruction of
forward movement on notice; it is time for Somalis simply to get on
with the job of moving toward political reconciliation,'' said
Ambassador Edward W. Gnehm Jr., the U.S. deputy permanent
representative to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Despite U.S. impatience, the Council decided to give Somalia the
``last chance'' Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said it
deserved after the United Nations spent some $2 billion in a year and
a half to rescue the east African country from famine and clan
warfare.
</P>
<P>
But Somalia has forced the United Nations to ponder how long it
should wait for warring leaders to settle their differences before
U.N. officials pull back their support and conclude they have done all
they can.
</P>
<P>
In a gloomy May 24 report, Boutros-Ghali told the Council that
security in Somalia is ``deteriorating,'' with forces allied with
militia leader Gen. Mohamed Farah Aideed on the offensive to seize new
turf in several regions. The 13 major clans have refused to honor a
commitment they made March 24 to disarm voluntarily, Boutros-Ghali
reported.
</P>
<P>
Because of the infighting and rampant banditry, ``the emergency
situation continues and the welfare of large numbers of Somalis
remains at risk,'' the secretary general warned. He said any immediate
draw-down of U.N. forces could plunge the nation back into the
war-induced starvation that killed hundreds of thousands of Somalis in
1992.
</P>
<P>
In all, 11 countries withdrew their troops from Somalia in the wake
of the United States' pullout in March, including all the units with
sophisticated equipment. Although 19,000 troops remain on the ground,
Boutros-Ghali admitted ``the deficiencies in capacity that resulted
from the withdrawal of the United States forces have not been made up
in full, especially with regards to air operations and night
capabilities.'' The current forces are too few to protect U.N.
humanitarian and training programs throughout the country, U.N.
officials said, yet the cost of the mission for the next four months
is $310 million, of which the United States will pay 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
After helping lead the U.N. mission into a shooting war in
Mogadishu a year ago, the Clinton administration abruptly began to
pull out U.S. troops after 18 American servicemen were killed in a
battle with Aideed's force in October. Washington then led the drive
in the Security Council to rewrite the mandate for U.N. troops to
eliminate forced disarmament and stress negotiations by clan leaders
to set up a new government.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. special envoy in Somalia, Lansana Kouyate, succeeded in
drawing Aideed back into the negotiations with a coalition of 12 other
clans. But a final conference to establish the framework for a new
national government has been repeatedly delayed amid jockeying for
position by Aideed and other leaders. Some observers have questioned
whether these talks are the right approach. In its most important
achievement, the U.N. mission has set up 55 district-level councils of
recognized village leaders. But it is unclear whether the clan leaders
will respect this grass-roots authority as they bargain among
themselves.
</P>
<P>
``Many Somalis to whom I spoke expressed grave reservations at the
prospect of the warlords, by whose hands so much Somali blood was
spilled, becoming their new rulers,'' wrote Malcolm Harper, the head
of the United Kingdom United Nations Association, after a recent
visit. The troubles of the Somalia mission cast a cloud over U.N.
operations in the rest of Africa, especially in Rwanda, where more
than 200,000 people have been killed in a tribal killing campaign. The
experience of Somalia made many countries skeptical about how
effective U.N. peacekeeping troops could be, even in large numbers, in
halting a bloody civil war. At the same time, many countries that
might have sent troops to Rwanda have exhausted their resources in
Somalia.

 White House Discloses More Helicopter Trips by Clinton Aides (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hoping to calm an uproar over abuse of presidential
helicopters, the White House disclosed Tuesday that aides have taken
12 trips using the aircraft but officials said none involved misuse of
the flights.
</P>
<P>
The disclosure came as the former official forced to resign last
week for using one of the choppers for a golf outing said he alone -- 
not top White House aides -- will cover the $13,129 cost of the trip.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen White House aides last Friday agreed to put up money to
reimburse the government for the cost of the trip by former White
House administrative chief W. David Watkins and two other aides.
</P>
<P>
But Watkins said in an interview that he changed his mind Sunday
after reading news accounts that quoted former colleagues at the White
House who were angered by the obligations he had forced on them.
Watkins said the $13,129 cost of the trip was far more than the $2,500
to $3,000 he was told the trip would cost.
</P>
<P>
``I did not want to create any financial burden for anyone, or
create any ill will toward me,'' said Watkins, a millionaire who
worked for Clinton as a businessman or aide for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
In detailing other trips on presidential helicopters, the White
House released a memo briefly describing the flights, which took place
between April 29, 1993, and May 24, 1994. Officials said the flights -- 
which excluded presidential and military journeys -- showed no misuse
of the sophisticated aircraft.
</P>
<P>
But congressional Republicans who have pressed for a full
accounting of the trips said the description did not provide
sufficient detail.
</P>
<P>
``This is just an outline,'' said Cheri Jacobus, an aide to Rep.
Roscoe Bartlett, R-Md. ``The White House's information has been
inconsistent, sporadic and incorrect. We want to know more.''
</P>
<P>
Bartlett and half a dozen others have been demanding more
information since it was disclosed that the three White House
officials used one of the $2,380-an-hour helicopters to go golfing
last Tuesday at the Holly Hills Country Club, near New Market, Md.
</P>
<P>
One entry on the White House inventory was an April 29, 1993,
flight to Camp David by Watkins and the two top officials of the White
House military office for ``camp familiarization.''
</P>
<P>
Such a flight ``may not be absolutely necessary,'' said a White
House spokeswoman. ``You can drive.'' But she insisted that the trip
``was appropriate ... because in many instances the president uses
helicopters.''
</P>
<P>
The inventory listed four trips within the Washington area for
``orientation and training.'' Listed on board were various White House
administrative, security and communications officials.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Three flights were classified, including a ``special training
mission'' that had an unlikely mix of passengers: Housing Secretary
Henry A. Cisneros, deputy budget director Alice M. Rivlin and military
personnel.
</P>
<P>
Another trip, a flight by Secretary of State Warren Christopher to
give a private speech in Williamsburg, Va., was described as
``reimbursable State Dept. use'' -- meaning the expense would be paid
with taxpayer funds, but from a different federal account.
</P>
<P>
And another was a trip in which White House advance staff, military
officials and communications aides flew to Norfolk, Va., to examine an
aircraft carrier Clinton will use this week in ceremonies to
commemorate the 50th anniversary of D-day.
</P>
<P>
In another step to try to restore confidence, White House Chief of
Staff Thomas F. ``Mack'' McLarty released a memo providing that from
now on, the staff chief or his deputy must approve flights. In their
absence, approvals can come from officials of the White House
counsel's office -- but no longer, as before, by the chief of
administration.

 FAA Adopts Policy to Protect Planes from 757 Turbulence (Santa Ana) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SANTA ANA, Calif.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing a crash that killed five people here
last December, the Federal Aviation Administration has adopted a
policy that will require smaller planes to stay farther behind Boeing
757 jetliners to prevent airplane accidents caused by their
potentially hazardous wake turbulence.
</P>
<P>
But the regulatory agency's action -- part of a detailed set of new
policies on 757s -- falls short of safety recommendations made by the
National Transportation Safety Board earlier this year. And aviation
safety experts and pilots' advocates termed the changes merely a
``first step'' toward making the skies safe for aircraft landing and
taking off behind 757 jetliners.
</P>
<P>
FAA Administrator David R. Hinson outlined the policy in recent
days in a letter to NTSB Chairman Carl W. Vogt.
</P>
<P>
Beginning July 1, the FAA will require air traffic controllers
handling landings to keep aircraft four miles behind 757s -- instead of
the current three miles -- to protect them from the miniature tornadoes
produced by rapid air movement across the larger aircraft's wings.
</P>
<P>
The NTSB in February had recommended that the FAA adopt minimum
separation distances of up to six miles behind 757s. The FAA, however,
is not bound by NTSB recommendations.
</P>
<P>
At least two accidents that claimed 13 lives and three other
serious incidents have been linked to 757 wake turbulence since
December 1992. Because it could potentially decrease the number of
flights at the nation's airports and increase costs for the hard-hit
airline industry, the FAA has been reluctant to increase separation
distances between 757s and tailing airplanes.
</P>
<P>
Researchers have speculated that the 757's unique, sleek-wing
design may be the cause of the turbulence that can be unusually
powerful for an aircraft of its size.
</P>
<P>
Both the fatal accidents occurred when corporate jets flew into
wake turbulence as they were preparing to land.
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ana crash occurred when a twin-engine corporate jet was
on a landing approach to John Wayne Airport. The jet, which was 2.1
miles behind a Boeing 757, went out of control and slammed nose-first
into the ground.
</P>
<P>
All five aboard, including the top two executives of the In-N-Out
Burger chain, were killed. The NTSB is still investigating the
accident, but turbulence from the 757 is said to have played a part.
</P>
<P>
The other fatal crash occurred in Billings, Mont., in 1992. Eight
people were killed.
</P>
<P>
NTSB spokesman Mike Benson said the safety board will review the
FAA's new policies and draft a formal response over the next several
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Bob Flock, a spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association, said,
``We think it's a good beginning. It certainly addresses part of our
concern. But it doesn't, for instance, address separation on
departures.''
</P>
<P>
ALPA, the largest pilots' organization in the world, recently
issued its own advisory on 757s, recommending that pilots of smaller
aircraft -- even MD-80s, Boeing 737s and DC-9s -- remain five miles or
at least ``two minutes'' behind 757s on final approach, Flocke said.
The organization also has recommended that pilots ask the control
tower for extra time when taking off behind 757s, Flocke said, to give
more time for the 757 turbulence to diminish.
</P>
<P>
Despite concerns from other corners of the aviation industry, the
FAA said it believes that the four-mile separation is safe enough -- 
for now.
</P>
<P>
``The FAA believes that this interim increased separation will
provide an extra margin of safety without unnecessarily impacting
system capacity,'' FAA Administrator Hinson wrote in a May 20 letter
outlining the changes to NTSB Chairman Vogt.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
The four-mile separation, Hinson wrote, recently was adopted by the
Civil Aviation Authority in Great Britain and ``has significantly
reduced the number of reported incidents'' there.
</P>
<P>
As part of its new policies on 757s, Hinson said, the FAA is
embarking on a two-year test with the help of the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration to determine the precise level of danger 757
wake turbulence poses. The four-mile separation limit will remain in
effect until testing shows whether additional distance is warranted,
Hinson said.
</P>
<P>
Leo Garodz, a former FAA manager who was among the first to bring
the 757 wake turbulence problem to the agency's attention in 1991,
said the new policies represented an ``initial step,'' but nothing
more.
</P>
<P>
``It's a beginning, but it's only a beginning, because there's
going to be another accident, because things are not that precise at
airports when there is a heavy traffic load,'' Garodz said.

 Powerful Rep. Rostenkowski Indicted on Corruption Charges (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal grand jury indicted House Ways and Means
Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski on corruption charges Tuesday,
alleging that over the past two decades he stole nearly $640,000 from
taxpayers and then tried to thwart an investigation into the alleged
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat who over the past 35 years rose
to become one of the most powerful members of Congress, defiantly
rejected a plea bargain over the weekend and vowed to fight in court
to regain his reputation.
</P>
<P>
The 17-count indictment, resulting from a two-year federal
investigation, charged that over a 21-year period, Rostenkowski
defrauded taxpayers of $638,000 and violated federal elections rules
by misreporting $56,000 in campaign funds spent for his personal
benefit. It alleged that he carried out his criminal scheme by putting
``ghost workers'' -- including a future son-in-law -- on his House
payroll to perform personal services; trading stamps and postage
vouchers for cash at the House post office; charging the government
for expensive gifts to friends; and creating fake car leases to get
taxpayers to put up most of the purchase price of seven personal
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
In addition to charges of embezzlement, mail and wire fraud,
conspiracy, concealing material facts and aiding and abetting,
Rostenkowski was accused of obstructing justice by urging a subpoenaed
witness not to tell the grand jury of doing personal engraving work
allegedly paid for from House funds.
</P>
<P>
Indirectly, the indictment also alleged, Rostenkowski used the
House payroll to renovate and clean his home, rent campaign offices
and get his laundry picked up.
</P>
<P>
At the House stationery store, the Justice Department charged,
Rostenkowski bought $42,500 in hand-carved chairs, crystal Capitol
replicas, china and luggage as personal gifts or for his own use,
passing them off as for official use. In February, with the
investigation nearing U.S. Attorney Eric Holder's recommendation of an
indictment, Rostenkowski wrote the Treasury a reimbursement check for
$82,095 for possible misuse of official resources in ordering the
gifts.
</P>
<P>
After months of news reports and leaks from the investigation, only
two aspects of the indictment were newly made public Tuesday: The
witness-tampering count and a charge that many of the ghost workers
had to kick back part of their paychecks to Rostenkowski's Chicago
office manager, who allegedly kept ``thousands of dollars'' on hand
for undisclosed purposes.
</P>
<P>
According to Holder, the engraver was one of ``at least'' 14
virtually do-nothing employees on Rostenkowski's official payroll.
They allegedly received a total of $529,200 from the government while
mainly handling such personal chores as mowing the congressman's
vacation-home lawn, keeping the books for his family insurance
business and photographing his daughters' weddings.
</P>
<P>
The indictment will complicate matters for President Clinton, who
was counting on Rostenkowski to help shepherd his health care
legislation and other key parts of his agenda through Congress.
</P>
<P>
``Like all Americans, Chairman Rostenkowski has the right to
contest the charges made against him and to have his day in court,''
Clinton stated. ``Chairman Rostenkowski and others have helped create
real momentum for health care reform, and I am confident that
legislation will pass this year.''
</P>
<P>
Although required by Democratic caucus rules to give up his
chairmanship until the charges against him are resolved, Rostenkowski
said he intends to remain in office and run for a 19th term in
November. ``I am confident that I will be vindicated,'' he said in a
statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
But at a news conference Tuesday afternoon in which he outlined the
felony counts against Rostenkowski, Holder said, ``We don't bring
cases when we think we cannot win them.''
</P>
<P>
Holder said Rostenkowski's alleged conduct was ``very
reprehensible, very offensive'' and ``a betrayal of the public trust
for personal gain.''
</P>
<P>
The federal statutes involved carry maximum total prison time of
110 years and $365,000 in fines, but under complex sentencing
guidelines, U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson probably would
order the defendant to serve ``several years in jail'' if convicted on
all counts, Holder said.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Holder expected an arraignment before Johnson in about 10 days, but
he said a trial date would be hard to predict because defense motions
could cause long delays. The trial probably would be held in
Washington, Holder said.
</P>
<P>
The indicted legislator made no public comment Tuesday.
Rostenkowski's lawyer, Robert Bennett, reportedly had recommended to
his client the acceptance of a deal for a one-count felony guilty plea
and a few months' jail time. Bennett said Tuesday he had ``nothing to
add'' to Rostenkowski's statement. Rumored to be on the way out as
Rostenkowski's lawyer, Bennett was still representing the defendant
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The investigation of Rostenkowski was prompted by corruption
scandals at the House post office, in which former House Postmaster
Robert V. Rota and eight other individuals have pleaded guilty.
Between 1978 and 1991, Rota often personally handed cash to
Rostenkowski at the committee chairman's behest in return for
federally paid stamps or vouchers, the indictment claimed.
Rostenkowski was accused of amassing at least $50,000 by masking the
cash handovers as stamp purchases.
</P>
<P>
Holder said the post office investigation is continuing.

 Grand Jury Charges Rostenkowski With 17 Money-Related Crimes (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal grand jury Tuesday charged Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski, an old-line Chicago politician who wields vast influence
in the House, with 17 serious crimes, ranging from grand-scale fraud
to petty money manipulation over a 20-year span.
</P>
<P>
In a 49-page indictment that threatens the Illinois Democrat with
many years in federal prison and potentially hundreds of thousands of
dollars in fines, he was charged with making personal use of upward of
$700,000 in money belonging to the House or to his campaign
committees.
</P>
<P>
Depending upon how federal judges would figure the prison sentence
they might give, the maximum Rostenkowski faces if convicted of all of
the charges is 110 years in jail and $365,000 in fines.
</P>
<P>
Eric H. Holder Jr., the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia,
told reporters at a news conference that the charges ``represent a
betrayal of the public trust for personal gain'' by Rostenkowski, who
stood accused of using ``his elective office to perpetrate an
extensive fraud on the American people.''
</P>
<P>
The indictment came after the breakdown of intense plea bargaining.
When a deal could not be reached, Holder was free to put the massive
indictment to a vote in the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
The congressman, who knew all of the accusations that prosecutors
were preparing to make, said over the weekend: ``I did not commit any
crimes.'' Tuesday, the lawmaker who has represented the North Side of
Chicago in Congress for the last 35 years, remained silent and out of
sight in the wake of the indictment that he has vowed to fight.
</P>
<P>
Already, however, the charges took away at least temporarily his
power-laden post as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee -- a
position outranked in influence by few if any posts in the House other
than that of the speaker.
</P>
<P>
Under the rules of the House Democratic Caucus, made up of all the
Democrats in that chamber, the congressman had to step down as
committee chairman because he was indicted for a felony that could
lead to two years or more in prison. If he is later found not guilty,
he may resume his chairmanship. He may go on serving in the House, and
seeking re-election, while the charges are pending.
</P>
<P>
In summary, the U.S. attorney said, Rostenkowski was being accused
of ``abusing his congressional allowances -- which are paid for by
American taxpayers'' in these ways:
</P>
<P>
-- Putting people on the congressional payroll ``who did little or no
official work,'' but who instead did personal and family chores in
return for more than $500,000 in payments.
</P>
<P>
-- Obtaining ``at least $50,000 in cash from the House Post Office by
disguising his transactions as stamp purchases.''
</P>
<P>
-- Charging Congress and the taxpayers ``more than $40,000 for the
purchase of valuable merchandise ... handed out as gifts to his
friends.''
</P>
<P>
-- ``Causing Congress to pay over $70,000 in taxpayer money for
personal vehicles used by himself and his family.''
</P>
<P>
-- ``He obstructed justice by instructing a witness to withhold
evidence from the grand jury.'' That charge was based on allegations
that the congressman directly told a House staff member -- an engraver
who was doing personal work for the congressman on gifts he was
handing out -- not to say anything after getting a subpoena from the
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski's ``elaborate scheme to defraud,'' prosecutors said,
involves the congressional payroll, the House Post Office, the House's
stationery store and the purchase of autos as a ``mobile district
office.''
</P>
<P>
He was accused specifically of embezzlement, mail and wire fraud,
covering up key facts, plotting to defraud, mail and wire fraud, and
false reporting of campaign spending.
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski is expected to plead not guilty before a federal judge
here within the next 10 days. Holder said he expected the trial to be
in Washington, but said he could not estimate when. The prosecutor
conceded that if Rostenkowski claims legal immunity under the
Constitution to charges because they involved actions as a legislator,
``that could have a delaying effect on how long it takes us to get to
trial.''
</P>
<P>
Holder added that Rep. Joseph McDade., R-Penn, was charged two
years ago with taking bribes ``and has yet to come to trial.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
President Clinton, whose legislative agenda including health care
reform had appeared to be dependent on Rostenkowski's influence in
Congress, said in a statement that ``like all Americans, Chairman
Rostenkowski has the right to contest the charges made against him and
to have his day in court.''
</P>
<P>
The president went on to praise Rostenkowski ``and others'' for
helping to ``create real momentum for health care reform.''
</P>
<P>
Holder, asked if his office had come under any political or White
House pressure in its investigation of Rostenkowski, said ``no, not at
all.'' The probe was ``free from any kind of outside interference and
free from any kind of political pressure.''

 Jamaica Will Help U.S. Process Haitians (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States has reached an agreement with
Jamaica to set up a facility on the Caribbean island to process
Haitian refugees, according to officials close to negotiations that
have been taking place between the two nations for several days.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is likely to be announced Wednesday in Kingston, the
officials said. This is the first time another government has offered
to help the Clinton administration share the burden of handling those
who flee Haiti's military regime by taking to the sea, most of them
seeking political asylum in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Aside from providing a diplomatic boost to the administration's
efforts, Jamaica has helped resolve logistical problems that have
bedeviled U.S. officials for weeks.
</P>
<P>
The United States asked Jamaica to consider hosting a refugee
facility last week and since then U.S. and Jamaican officials have
been engaged in almost continuous discussions, here and in Kingston.
</P>
<P>
The likely agreement would allow the United States to anchor or
dock large ships in a Jamaican port or at least close to shore, the
officials said. The ships would be used to house Haitians picked up by
the Coast Guard and would serve as a processing center where their
applications for refugee status would be heard and adjudicated. U.S.
officials could be housed on land along with all facilities needed to
support the ships. President Clinton's special advisor on Haiti,
former House member William H. Gray III, was to arrive in Jamaica
Tuesday afternoon and begin meetings with top Jamaican officials
today. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott is due to begin a
visit to Kingston Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A formal agreement on a processing facility could be announced
during these meetings, officials said, and the first Haitians could be
brought to Jamaica as early as the beginning of next week.
</P>
<P>
``We are encouraged by the progress that has been made in the talks
and we are hopeful progress will continue and that we will be able to
say something more on this soon,'' a senior U.S. official said. In
recent weeks Clinton repeatedly has emphasized his desire to pursue a
policy on Haiti with international and especially regional support.
</P>
<P>
He was able to win such backing for tighter economic sanctions
against Haiti, which went into effect on May 21. But it has proved
more difficult for Clinton to get help with the other half of his
Haitian dilemma, the handling of boat people.
</P>
<P>
After protests by civil rights groups and refugee advocates,
Clinton on May 8 ended a policy of automatically returning all
Haitians picked up at sea without giving them a chance to seek the
shelter of refugee status.
</P>
<P>
Instead he promised to set up facilities that would let the
Haitians apply for refugee status, which entitles them to permanent
resettlement in the United States. Clinton insisted, however, that
most boat people were likely to be rejected and sent back. Although it
has held discussions with a number of governments in the regions, the
only expression of support the administration had received thus far
was an agreement with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees to
cooperate on handling the boat people.
</P>
<P>
Last week the United States sought permission to locate a
processing facility on the Turks and Caicos Islands, a British
dependency, but has yet to receive a response.

 Police `Blue Flu' Is Minor Disruption, Major Irritant (Los Angeles) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LOS ANGELES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles police officers staged day two of their
mass sickout Tuesday, causing minor disruption of public service,
exasperating city officials and prompting Mayor Richard Riordan to
call for a mediator to step in.
</P>
<P>
In an unusual joint appearance designed to signal the seriousness
and solidarity of the city's leadership, Riordan appeared with six
council members standing behind him as he spelled out the city's
budget woes.
</P>
<P>
``The city respects the police and wants to give them a raise and
reward them for a job well done,'' Riordan said. ``(But) the city is
facing the gravest fiscal situation since the Great Depression.''
</P>
<P>
The mayor called on the officers' union, the Police Protective
League, to permit an impartial mediator to settle the two-year-old
dispute.
</P>
<P>
``If mediation is rejected, the council will have no other choice
in my opinion and I believe they will vote for an impasse,'' Riordan
said. Declaration of an impasse would allow the city to call in a
mediator without the union's approval; if mediation fails, the city
ultimately could impose a contract unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
Although officially unsanctioned by the officers' union, the job
action known as ``Blue Flu II'' enjoyed wide support from the
rank-and-file Tuesday: Of 548 officers scheduled to report to day
watch duty, 248 -- or 43 percent -- called in sick. Other officers were
ordered to work double shifts to cover for their ``ailing''
colleagues. The three-day sickout was scheduled to enter its final
stretch with the Tuesday evening shift calling in sick.
</P>
<P>
The union, legally barred from any official involvement in the
sickout, denounced the mayor's suggestion that a mediator be
appointed, condemning it as a stalling tactic that would only escalate
the dispute. Union leaders also decried the increasingly rancorous
tenor of the management-labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
The city has offered 3 percent raises over the next two years. The
union is seeking retroactive raises for the two years officers have
worked without a contract. A rookie officer earns about $33,000 a
year.

 Benefits Systems Move Toward Cashless Automation (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Welfare recipients, unemployed workers and military
pensioners moved closer to joining the cashless society Tuesday as
Vice President Gore announced plans for a new nationwide system of
delivering federal and state benefits electronically.
</P>
<P>
In five years, Gore said, the governments will be delivering more
than $111 billion in benefits annually to recipients through
electronic transfers, with recipients using magnetically encoded
``benefit security cards'' to make transactions at bank automatic
teller machines and to receive food stamp credit when buying
groceries. The new system, one of the ``reinventing government''
proposals in Gore's National Performance Review last year, will save
up to $195 million a year in paperwork and greatly reduce fraud and
theft of benefit checks, the vice president said.
</P>
<P>
Pilot electronic transfer programs for food stamp distribution will
be gradually expanded from the few states already involved -- Maryland,
Texas and New Mexico among them -- to cover Aid to Families With
Dependent Children (AFDC), the main state-federal welfare program,
Veterans Affairs compensation, military pensions, civil service
retirement programs, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), unemployment
insurance and other benefit programs. An electronic benefits task
force, headed by Elizabeth Sawhill, associate director for human
resources at the Office of Management and Budget, is working with the
Southern Alliance of States to develop the first federal-state
prototype of the new benefits system.
</P>
<P>
Gore said thousands of automatic teller machines and supermarkets
across the country will be linked to federal and state agencies by
commercial computer networks so that by 1999 food stamps and paper
checks will be virtually eliminated in most government benefit
programs.
</P>
<P>
The vice president said bank executives had expressed support for
the program because it will give them opportunities to add new
customers.
</P>
<P>
He said recipients of 12 programs who receive $31 million a year in
benefits but do not have bank accounts would still be able to withdraw
cash benefits through automatic teller machines by using the benefits
card and a personal identification number.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, who joined Gore in a news
conference to announce the plan, said his department spends $75
million a year printing and distributing $22 billion worth of food
stamps and another $22 billion to retrieve and destroy the used
coupons and reconcile them. He said welfare recipients still would not
be able to purchase excluded items such as alcohol with food stamp
credit because the computer automatically would reject such purchases.
</P>
<P>
The Consumers Union, however, criticized the plan, calling it a
``disaster for public assistance recipients'' and accusing the
government of ``bowing'' to banks seeking to make more profits and
state governments wanting to cut administrative costs.
</P>
<P>
Michelle Meier, counsel for the union, said welfare recipients not
only will have to pay a withdrawal fee for each automatic teller
machine transaction, but will be exempted from regulations that
require other consumers to bear only a portion of the loss when funds
are stolen from their account.

 Grand Jury Says Rostenkowski Misused $500,000 (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal grand jury Tuesday charged Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., with misappropriating more than a $500,000,
tampering with a witness and using taxpayers' money to enrich himself,
his friends and his family.
</P>
<P>
``The allegations contained in today's indictment represent a
betrayal of the public trust for personal gain,'' said U.S. Attorney
Eric H. Holder Jr. ``... Congressman Rostenkowski used his elective
office to perpetrate extensive fraud on the American people.''
</P>
<P>
The 17-count indictment charges that Rostenkowski, 66, chairman of
the House Ways and Means Committee, engaged in a pattern of corrupt
activity for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
He personally directed the House Finance Office to place at least
14 ``ghost employees'' who performed little or no official work on the
payroll, the grand jury said.
</P>
<P>
Instead, they mowed the lawn of his vacation house in Wisconsin,
picked up his laundry, took pictures at his daughters' weddings and
supervised the renovation of Rostenkowski's house, the indictment
charges. In one instance, Rostenkowski's future, now former,
son-in-law was required to return most of his government salary to the
congressman in cash kickbacks, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
The government also alleges that Rostenkowski obtained seven cars
valued at more than $100,000 from a Chicago dealership, while paying
only $5,294 from the bank account of his daughters. The remainder of
the debt was paid by the government and his campaign committee,
prosecutors allege. The charges were leveled one day after
Rostenkowski rejected a proposed plea agreement with prosecutors and
went on the offensive, denying all charges and vowing to fight in
court.``I have always fought for what I believe in,'' Rostenkowski
said in a statement faxed around the country Monday evening. ``I
strongly believe that I am not guilty of these charges and will fight
to regain my reputation in court. ... This will be a difficult fight.
The government has vast resources at its disposal.''
</P>
<P>
A Rostenkowski spokesman said the 36-year veteran of Congress would
have no comment Tuesday and that his earlier statement would suffice.
Holder called the actions ``offensive and reprehensible,'' stating
that such official misconduct had a ``corrosive effect'' on the
nation's ``democratic system of government and on the trust our
citizens have in their elected officials.''
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski is expected to be arraigned within the next 10 days,
but a trial date is uncertain, prosecutors said, because of the time
required to respond to expected defense motions. If the charges were
taken separately, Rostenkowski would face a maximum penalty of more
than 100 years in prison if convicted, but federal sentencing
guidelines would prescribe much less confinement. Holder said
Rostenkowski faced ``several years.''
</P>
<P>
The indictment alleges that Rostenkowski abused his congressional
payroll account, his House Stationery Store privileges, his House Post
Office prerogatives and his expense allotment for vehicle leasing.
</P>
<P>
Holder said that Rostenkowski ``regularly put people on his
congressional payroll who did little or no official work, but who
instead performed a variety of personal services for him, his family,
his family insurance business, and his campaign organizations.''
Holder said that payments to them exceeded $500,000.
</P>
<P>
The government charges that between July 1971 and July 1992,
Rostenkowski placed 14 people on his congressional payroll who
performed personal services for him and his family.
</P>
<P>
One person allegedly received $20,000 in federal funds for taking
photographs at the congressman's daughters' weddings, political
fund-raisers and parties held at Rostenkowski's family vacation house.
</P>
<P>
A second person allegedly received $48,400 during a four-year
period while performing no government work. The father of that same
``ghost employee'' paid two of Rostenkowski's daughters a total of
$48,000 through the payroll of the Illinois State Senate Office, the
indictment charges. Another person, identified as Rostenkowski's
17-year-old godson, collected $1,500 in government salary in 1976 for
``mowing the grass ... at defendant Rostenkowski's summer home.''
</P>
<P>
During much of this period, Rostenkowski allegedly maintained
``close'' control over his payroll, personally determining each month
who should be added to the accounts, how they long they would remain
and how much they should be paid, the indictment charges. Further,
Rostenkowski instructed the House Finance Office not to disclose any
payroll information to members of his staff.
</P>
<P>
The indictment charges that Rostenkowski kept the same ``payroll
counselor'' to assist him in ``payroll matters'' for 10 years in
violation of House policy that required such staff to be rotated every
two years in an effort to prevent fraud.
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski's office created an ``untraceable'' supply of cash by
instructing several employees to cash their checks and return them to
the Chicago district office manager, prosecutors alleged. ``Then, as
these people performed services -- whether personal, official or
campaign related -- they were paid in cash in substantially smaller
amounts than the checks that initially had been issued to them.''
</P>
<P>
The indictment also alleges that Rostenkowski obstructed justice by
instructing a witness to withhold evidence from the grand jury. In
1991, Rostenkowski asked a House employee -- whom he had earlier placed
on the congressional office payroll -- to engrave 50 brass plaques and
to place them on the bases of 50 sculptures of the U.S. Capitol,
prosecutors said. The plaques and the sculptures had been bought at
the House Stationary Store and charged to his official account.
</P>
<P>
The employee was asked to engrave the names of recipients, followed
by a phrase such as ``friendship'' or ``our pal,'' and then followed
by the first name of Rostenkowski and his wife. The employee did the
work for no charge. In September 1993, the employee was asked to
testify before a grand jury investigating Rostenkowski.
</P>
<P>
``The engraver (employee) went to see the congressman's
administrative assistant in Washington, who had earlier told him that
Rostenkowski's campaign committee was paying for lawyers for people
called before the grand jury,'' Holder said. ``After putting the
engraver in contact with an attorney, the administrative assistant
told the engraver that Rostenkowski wished to speak with him. Over the
telephone, Rostenkowski instructed the engraver not to say anything
about the crystal sculptures. . . . '' Rostenkowski obtained some
$40,000 in merchandise from the House Stationery Store, the bulk of
which he distributed as gifts to friends and associates, prosecutors
said.``He charged the items to his official expenses allowance,
causing Congress to pay for them based on his false representation
that the items were being purchased for official use,'' Holder said.
</P>
<P>
The list of items purchased included: 60 wooden armchairs,
handpainted and inscribed with his name for $379 each, 60 crystal
sculptures of the U.S. Capitol at total cost of $12,000, 250 pieces of
china at $5,000 and 22 pieces of luggage valued at $2,200.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors charge that Rostenkowski obtained at least $50,000 in
cash from the post office by ``disguising the transactions as stamp
purchases.'' Members of Congress have ``franking privileges'' that
enable them to send official mail without postage. However, the frank
cannot be used for certified, insured or express mail, and for these
letters lawmakers can purchase stamps at the House Post Office. House
members are required to submit vouchers that must be signed by the
legislators, certifying that they have paid for or received the
postage specified on the voucher.
</P>
<P>
From May 1985 through May 1987, Rostenkowski personally obtained
$11,500 from the House Post Office through the postmaster, the
indictment states. The postmaster got the cash from the post office
supervisor of accounts, according to the charges. When that supervisor
left in 1987, the postmaster allegedly told Rostenkowski that he was
no longer able to obtain the cash.
</P>
<P>
``When the second supervisor of accounts left in 1989, Congressman
Rostenkowski personally intervened and insisted that one of his
patronage employees be promoted to the position,'' a Justice
Department press statement said. Then, during a 21-month period in
July 1989 and April 1991, Rostenkowski obtained $9,800 more in
exchange for vouchers and stamps, prosecutors said, noting that the
alleged scheme ended one month later when Capitol Police began
investigating allegations of embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors charge that Rostenkowski was able to develop a
``unique'' relationship with a suburban Chicago Ford dealership,
enabling him to obtain immediate possession of and title to vehicles
without a down payment, without taking out a loan, without signing a
promissory note, without paying interest on the debt and without
making regular payments.
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski submitted fraudulent lease agreements to the House
Finance Office, which ``falsely'' represented that the payments would
be for leasing the vehicles, prosecutors said. About $73,000 in
government funds were used for the vehicles which were ``for the
personal use of himself and his family.'' The indictment was issued
after a two-week period of plea bargaining discussions with
Rostenkowski's attorney, Robert S. Bennett. Last week the congressman
declined to accept an agreement that he plead guilty to at least one
felony count and serve a limited time in jail. Rostenkowski was said
to have entered the negotiations in effort to reduce or eliminate any
prison sentence while avoiding a lengthy court battle. He also wanted
to retain his chairmanship. Such talks are considered normal and
should not affect his trial.
</P>
<P>
Holder said Rostenkowski's attorneys initiated the talks, and that
the government's only interest was in avoiding a costly trial. The
talks in no way, he said, were reflective of concern on his part about
the strength of the case. Sources said the talks ended without
agreement because Rostenkowski maintained his innocence. There had
been some tension between Rostenkowski and Bennett over the handling
of his case and there was speculation about whether Bennett would
continue. Longtime friends had urged the lawmaker to fight, while
defense attorneys urged him to weigh all options and even suggested
that he get a second opinion about whether to accept a plea bargain.

 Government Benefits of the Future Will Come From ATM Machine (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a step that eventually would eliminate paper Social
Security, welfare checks and food stamps, Vice President Al Gore
unveiled a program Tuesday that would allow electronic access to
government benefits.
</P>
<P>
Using a plastic automated teller machine card, welfare recipients
and Social Security pensioners without bank accounts would be able to
walk up to any ATM terminal and withdraw their share of the $500
billion in benefit payments that the federal government doles out
annually.
</P>
<P>
The electronic delivery system, designed as part of the Clinton
administration's ``reinventing government'' initiative, is projected
to go on-line nationally in 1999. Government officials from nine
states -- Florida, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina,
Tennessee, Kentucky, Arkansas and Missouri -- will start phasing in the
electronic transfer plan in their region this year. The system is
expected to be running in those states in 1996.
</P>
<P>
``This card makes it much easier to deliver the right benefits to
the right people with much less paperwork,'' Gore said at a ceremony
here Tuesday. Appearing with him were Health and Human Services
Secretary Donna E. Shalala, Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy and Texas
Comptroller John Sharp, who is overseeing what will be the largest
state electronics benefits transfer project when it is fully phased in
next year.
</P>
<P>
Electronic delivery, once fully installed, is expected to reduce
the fraud and abuse that plague current assistance programs and
simplify labyrinthian federal and state benefits systems, saving
taxpayers $195 million annually, Gore said.
</P>
<P>
With the electronic system, ``there's considerably less paper. The
flip side is that we'll have an electronic audit trail for every
transaction, making fraud much easier to detect and prosecute,''
Shalala said.
</P>
<P>
For benefits recipients with bank accounts, having their payments
deposited directly is still the most cost-effective means of delivery.
But for the estimated 31 million people without bank accounts who are
entitled to food stamps, unemployment payments, Social Security
payments, aid to families with dependent children or other benefits,
the electronic system will bring convenience and relief from the
``stigma'' associated with receiving government aid, according to
Espy.
</P>
<P>
Federal and state governments pay $111 billion in military and
federal pensions, veterans' compensation, student loans and general
assistance to recipients without bank accounts each year.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, the annual fund flow for VISA, the nation's most
widely used credit card, approaches $180 billion, the Gore task force
that came up with the plan said.
</P>
<P>
Food stamp recipients would swipe the benefits card through a debit
card machine in a grocery store instead of paying for their purchases
with paper vouchers. The card would block recipients from buying
prohibited products and allow government fraud investigators to track
transactions more closely than does the current system. Each card user
would have a personal identification number to prevent thieves from
using stolen cards.
</P>
<P>
Printing food stamps -- vouchers that grocery shoppers use instead
of cash -- is wasteful because each voucher can only be used once, Espy
said. In inner city areas, food stamp transactions can comprise as
much as 40 percent of a grocery store's retail food sales, according
to the task force. Once the food stamps are collected by grocery
stores and shipped back to the Agriculture Department, they are
burned.
</P>
<P>
``The food stamps program we've been operating in this country for
the last 30 years belongs in the same place the dinosaurs are,'' Sharp
said. Texas state officials began developing their electronic system
to pay veterans' and old age benefits in 1991, he said.
</P>
<P>
But benefits recipients could be liable for a large chunk of the
cost of goods purchased with pilfered cards and could be forced to pay
ATM-user fees. Under a current federal law known as Regulation E, a
consumer is entitled to reimbursement from his credit card company for
all but the first $50 that is fraudulently charged on a stolen card if
the theft is reported within two days. Earlier this year, however, the
Federal Reserve Board exempted the electronic benefits system from the
rule for three years.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Critics fear that the potential fraud losses may bar expansion of
the system. Gore's report says that the federal government will work
with states and the banking industry to develop strategies to limit
exposure to fraudulent claims and distribute the liability among all
who have a stake in the new system.
</P>
<P>
Gore's plan permits commercial banks to charge welfare recipient
fees for each transaction, and represents ``a kick in the teeth'' to
poor people, said Michelle Meier, counsel for government affairs for
the Consumers Union, which publishes Consumer Report magazine.
</P>
<P>
``We are very disappointed that the administration appears to be
laying the groundwork to cut the safety net on poor people,'' Meier
said.
</P>
<P>
Pilot programs enacted so far appear to have met with some success,
however. Maryland is the only state now fully operating the electronic
delivery system. It pays about $55 million in food stamps, child
support and other benefits each month to about 250,000 people.

 Indictment Charges Rostenkowski With 17 Felony Counts (Washn) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., was indicted on 17
felony counts of fraud and embezzlement Tuesday, a far broader set of
charges than many expected, for alleged acts that ranged from taking
kickbacks of government funds from a son-in-law to buying cars for his
family with public and campaign money.
</P>
<P>
The lawmaker also is accused of personally tampering with a witness
last September by instructing him not to reveal potentially
incriminating information to the federal grand jury investigating the
case, and of using government wages to pay employees who performed
little official work but did such personal chores as photographing one
of his daughter's weddings and mowing the lawn at his summer home.
</P>
<P>
The indictment, which alleges corruption over more than 20 years,
also charged Rostenkowski, who has been in Congress nearly 36 years,
with using postage vouchers to steal cash from Congress and cashing
campaign fund checks at the House Post Office to disguise them as
stamp purchases, an outgrowth of the House Post Office probe that led
to the Rostenkowski case.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Attorney Eric H. Holder Jr. announced the charges after
plea-bargaining talks collapsed and Rostenkowski defiantly proclaimed
his innocence. Holder said Rostenkowski ``used his elective office to
perpetrate an extensive fraud on the American people'' that amounted
to hundreds of thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Holder said the cost of the alleged misconduct ``must also be
measured in terms of the corrosive effect it has on our democratic
system of government and on the trust our citizens have in their
elected officials.
</P>
<P>
``The criminal acts of a few feed the cynicism which increasingly
haunts our political landscape,'' Holder said. This causes ``too many
of our citizens to assume that all persons in public office are
motivated by greed and self-interest, and to succumb to the defeatist
notion that we must resign ourselves to the fact that a certain level
of political misconduct is a way of life.''
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Tom Foley, D-Wash., contending that Rostenkowski
``clearly deserves the presumption of innocence,'' said the Chicago
native has stepped aside as chairman of the House Ways and Means
committee until the charges are resolved, in keeping with rules of the
Democratic Caucus. Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla., ranking member of the
panel which has a crucial role in handling health care reform, will
become acting chairman, but Rostenkowski ``will continue to be fully
involved,'' Foley said.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton tried to minimize the impact on health care,
saying ``real momentum'' has been created and that he is confident the
legislation will pass this year.
</P>
<P>
But the political fallout of the grand jury's action appeared
substantial. Rarely have Rostenkowski's legendary deal-making skills
been more sorely needed than now, when Clinton is asking a Democratic
Congress to take a risky leap on health care reform shortly before an
election when many political futures are at stake.
</P>
<P>
Following that battle, Ways and Means will be at the center of
other issues that could be crucial to the success of Clinton's
presidency -- most notably, welfare reform, trade and, once again,
revamping the Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
Yet while Rostenkowski's giving up the chairmanship will make the
already difficult task of passing health legislation even harder, few
believe that the survival of health care reform hinges on having him
there to cut the deal. The political forces at work on the issue are
so large that they transcend any one person's influence -- even one as
important as Rostenkowski's.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, despite the negotiations surrounding the impending
indictment, Rostenkowski has devoted himself to the health care bill
with a single-mindedness that many of his colleagues have found
remarkable. ``Rostenkowski's (bill) is damn near ready,'' said one
administration official.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Because he did not agree to a plea-bargain that would have forced
his resignation from Congress, Rostenkowski will remain on the
committee. As long as it remains possible that he will return to the
chairmanship, he can still exert some influence among Democrats. And
because the committee Democrats will be drafting their bill behind
closed doors, Rostenkowski may still find a way to operate as the
panel's de facto chairman, while Gibbons assumes the public role.
</P>
<P>
If Rostenkowski were convicted of all the felony counts, he
theoretically could be sentenced to 110 years in prison and fined a
maximum of $365,000, excluding any restitution he was ordered to pay.
But all the charges are subject to the federal sentencing guidelines,
which prescribe ranges of punishment depending on such factors as
whether the crime involved an abuse of trust.

<P>
Holder said he expected the trial to take place here and last
several weeks. While arraingment will be held within 10 days, Holder
would not forecast when the trial would begin.
</P>
<P>
The 49-page indictment alleged that Rostenkowski created an
elaborate scheme to defraud Congress and taxpayers through the misuse
of congressional allowances involving payroll, the House Stationery
Store, the House Post Office and purchase of vehicles. He also was
charged with embezzlement, conspiracy, obstruction of justice and
concealing material facts from Congress and the Federal Election
Commission.
</P>
<P>
In the payroll allegations, Rostenkowski was charged with
misappropriating approximately $500,000 in taxpayer funds by placing
at least 14 people on his payroll who did little or no congressional
work.
</P>
<P>
The workers included a former son-in-law who allegedly received
$10,400 in government salary but performed no work in the
congressional office and was required to give most of the money back
to his former father-in-law as cash kickbacks.
</P>
<P>
In another arrangement, prosecutors say the son of an Illinois
state senator, not identified in the indictment, drew about $48,400 in
salary from Rostenkowski's congressional office, though he did no
official work. Over the same 1983-1986 time period, the indictment
charged, the state senator paid two of Rostenkowski's daughters a
total of $48,000 through his payroll.
</P>
<P>
In the House Stationery Store scheme, Rostenkowski allegedly
obtained more than $40,000 worth of valuable merchandise, most of
which he handed out as gifts to personal friends and associates. But
he was accused of charging the items to his official expense
allowance, which Congress paid.
</P>
<P>
(Optional Add End)
</P>
<P>
The obstruction of justice count involved a House engraver whom
Rostenkowski allegedly put on his payroll to engrave 50 brass plaques
and attach them to 50 crystal sculptures of the Capitol that he
obtained from the House Stationery Story and charged to his official
expense allowance.
</P>
<P>
Last September the engraver was subpoenaed to testify before the
federal grand jury looking into Rostenkowski. Before testifying,
however, the engraver, whom Holder declined to identify, was
instructed by Rostenkowski during a telephone call not to tell the
grand jury about the Capitol sculptures he had engraved for the
congressman.
</P>
<P>
Holder declined to discuss the provisions of the plea bargain that
Rostenkowski rejected, against the advice of his lawyers. But a source
familiar with the negotiations said it involved admitting some
elements of the stationery store allegations, the acquisition of
vehicles on false grounds and the ghost employee charges. The proposed
deal also called for Rostenkowski to resign from Congress and to serve
a six-month jail sentence, the source said.
</P>
<P>
The plea-bargaining put a strain on relations between Rostenkowski
and his lawyers, Robert S. Bennett and Carl Rauh, but Bennett was
still representing him Tuesday morning, Holder noted.

 Police Look for Motive in Nation of Islam Shooting (Riverside) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
RIVERSIDE, Calif.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The former Nation of Islam minister who is
suspected of shooting Khallid Abdul Muhammad on Sunday night was seen
outside a Los Angeles theater the previous night while Muhammad was
speaking inside, sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Several Nation of Islam members knew the shooting suspect,
49-year-old James Edward Bess, of Tacoma, Wash., and recognized him as
he sat in his parked car, then walked back and forth outside the
theater, said various sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Police investigators said they were trying to learn whether
Muhammad, one of the most controversial figures within the Nation of
Islam, was being stalked by Bess.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Inside of Bess' vehicle, which was parked near the University of
California, Riverside, gymnasium where Sunday's shooting occured,
police found a scope-equipped, high-powered rifle and ammunition.
Outside the gymnasium, police recovered a backpack containing two
additional semi-automatic handguns, similar to the one they say was
used in the shooting.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Police said Tuesday they remained clueless about Bess' motives and
had little information about Bess' falling-out with the Nation of
Islam.
</P>
<P>
``We're not dealing with a whodunit,'' said UC Riverside Police
Chief Hank Rosenfeld. ``We know whodunit. What we're dealing with is,
why?''
</P>
<P>
(Optional Add End)
</P>
<P>
Bess was arraigned Tuesday afternoon before Riverside Municipal
Court Judge Gary Tranbarger. He was formally charged with one count of
attempted premeditated murder, with the use of a gun and inflicting
great bodily injury. Bess also was charged with five counts of assault
with a firearm with infliction of great bodily injury. The most
serious charge carries a possible life prison term.
</P>
<P>
Bess remains hospitalized at Riverside General Hospital for
injuries he sustained from a beating he took in the melee following
the shooting.
</P>
<P>
Riverside County Deputy District Attorney Bill Mitchell said
doctors gave the go-ahead for Bess to be taken by wheelchair from the
hospital to the courtroom, dressed in blue pajamas and his left arm
bandaged to his side to protect a broken shoulder. Abrasions on his
face and head were apparent.
</P>
<P>
Answering the judge's inquiries in a soft voice, Bess pleaded not
guilty to the six counts and was assigned a public defender, Mitchell
said. His preliminary hearing was scheduled for June 14, and he was
being held without bail and under police guard.
</P>
<P>
Muhammad, who was suspended as spokesman for the Nation of Islam by
Louis Farrakhan after a verbal assault on Jews, Arabs and whites was
roundly denunciated, underwent surgery Tuesday night at Riverside
Community Hospital to remove a bullet lodged in his leg.
</P>
<P>
Persons familiar with Bess characterized him as a generally loyal
follower of Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, despite having
been removed as minister of a Seattle mosque about four years ago, and
later ousted altogether from the Nation of Islam.
</P>
<P>
One source said Bess lost his ranking because he ran an
``unproductive'' mosque, where attendance had slipped to an all-time
low and was making no money.

 Whale's Tale Ends Happily as Inky Returns to Sea (Cape Canaveral) 
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With high hopes for her future, marine
scientists returned Inky the whale to her Atlantic Ocean home Tuesday
 -- 
</P>
<P>
after recovering from an overdose of pollution.
</P>
<P>
The well-traveled whale, rescued from a New Jersey beach on
Thanksgiving and nursed back to health in a five-month stay at
Baltimore's National Aquarium, was taken into deep water about 35
miles east of Cape Canaveral by a National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration vessel and given her freedom.
</P>
<P>
Inky immediately dispelled the fears of aquarium officials that she
would be slow to adapt and simply swim around in circles waiting for a
food handout.
</P>
<P>
``She just took right off,'' said aquarium veterinarian Brent
Whitaker after Inky nosed into the ocean -- carrying a small radio
transmitter and a microcomputer so marine experts can keep track of
her activities over the next few days.
</P>
<P>
The pygmy sperm whale's last trip with human caretakers began at
the Marineland park south of St. Augustine where she and another
stranded female of her species, nicknamed Blinky, had occupied round
holding pools about 20 feet apart.
</P>
<P>
Inky was carried in a custom-fitted canvas sling by a backhoe and
loaded onto a foam bed in a borrowed refrigerated seafood company
truck, while Blinky was moved in like fashion into a Marineland truck
for a predawn, 112-mile ride to Cape Canaveral under police escort.
</P>
<P>
Blinky, having overcome a small infection at Marineland, was
transferred to the Coast Guard Cutter Drummond, while Inky was taken
aboard the Relentless -- a 226-foot former Navy submarine surveillance
vessel making its maiden mission for NOAA and the National Marine
Fisheries Service.
</P>
<P>
Blinky, unencumbered by equipment, was lowered in a sling from the
side of the cutter and vanished in the sea swells. Cmdr. Patrick
Ruttan said NOAA's cooperation was part of its mandated mission to
educate the public on ocean pollution -- like the plastic trash that
Inky swallowed and nearly died from in November, emerging as a living
symbol of that environmental problem.
</P>
<P>
With the whale's story being turned into a documentary film for
young people, Ruttan said the benefits ``will far outweigh the costs
so far of getting Inky released.''
</P>
<P>
Aquarium officials said those costs could be close to $500,000 -- 
most of it in donated services from government agencies and the
private sector, but not including some 40,000 hours of labor provided
by the dozens of volunteers in its marine animal rescue program.
</P>
<P>
Inky survived longer in captivity than any other seriously ill
pygmy sperm whale, and Dr.Joseph H. Geraci, a consulting veterinarian
and marine mammal expert, said she enabled scientists to greatly
expand their knowledge of the species' physiology and behavior,
including the discovery that it emits the highest-frequency sonar-like
sound of any whale.
</P>
<P>
Even in being released, Inky will continue to provide information -- 
until saltwater exposure disintegrates the bolts attaching the radio
transmitter and microcomputer to the whale's small dorsal fin.
